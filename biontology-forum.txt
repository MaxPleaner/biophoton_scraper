Titanium Chip in Breast

rmargilrmargil
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Contraindications Flag
Hello,

I have a client who told me that doctors want to insert a titanium chip in her
breast to help them relocate abnormal cells that they recently found. They want
to put it in for their convenience to locate these abnormal cells again in the
future. 

I suggested to her to wait a while until I get some info from people
participating in The Forum about whether anyone knows the toxic/side effect of
inserting this titanium chip in her breast. Any insight would be greatly
appreciated. Thank you.

    See the MELISA Medica Foundation website. Today 1-5% of patients are
    titanium sensitive. It can cause systemic inflammatory effects IF she is
    one of them. The blood test takes 2-3 weeks to get results.

    Hi Rich

    In general Titanium is used and accepted by the body and we mostly do not
    measure Titanium as a problem with Chiren. 

    I would talk to her about what her expectations are and leave the choice to
    her, and it is not only about the metal but the reason for installing it
    that is important here. Discuss with her what are her alternatives with
    Chiren instead of the chip to give true healing not only a detector... but
    the choice is up to her.

    I thought Titanium implants (jaw)  which they are using now, caused a big
    problem, is that not true?

    When I worked as an operating room nurse, most of our metal implants were
    made out of titanium because it is considered to be the least reactive
    metal in the body. However allopathic medicine does not take into account
    the issue of energetic disturbances often caused by metals so I'm not sure
    if titanium creates less of an energetic disturbance than other metals.  I
    suspect that the negative issue of jaw implants, including the titanium
    ones, may have much to do with:


    1. Surgery in the mouth, already being an area that has much bacteria, can
    cause an infection in the area of the implant. Titanium implants in in
    other areas of the body are ususally being done in a joint or area of the
    body that is considered free of bacteria and is performed under sterile
    conditions (unlike in the mouth).


    2. Each tooth corresponds to a meridian and which means any disturbance can
    problems throughout the rest of the body

    Thank you for your clarity regarding this titanium discussion.
     
    The "natural" dentists I know however do not appove the use of titanium as
    implants. In fact they are against implants.
     
    I do believe it causes the disturbances we see in many people, particularly
    along as you said, the dental meridian corrosponding to the tooth, and
    often for reasons above there is infection in the jawbone around the
    implant.
     
    I do have clients that I believe, as Toril pointed out, are having an
    inflammatory response to the titanium, not infection but inflamation.  

    But what to do ... most people are not willing to get out the implant. 

    In the case of the woman above she has a choice and Nora's suggestion and
    Toril's website hopefully will convince her not to implant the titanium.
    Don't they just put a tattoo spot over the affected area?

    Tattoos have traditionally been used to precisely target a tumor during
    repeated administration of radiation, in order to minimalize collateral
    damage to healthy tissue.  I’m not familiar with implanting titanium chips
    in a breast but it’s been years since I worked in the hospital setting.  My
    speculation is that a chip could be used during a radiological study to
    compare the size of a cancerous growth that is located next to it.  In this
    case a tattoo would be of little value since the area radiated would be
    used for diagnostic/monitoring purposes and would not require a tightly
    focused beam of radiation.

    found, for the most part, another way, Biontology.

Ovarian Cancer

Carol
February 2014 edited February 2014 in General Questions Flag
Client:
Woman in her mid 70's, starting treatment soon.  She is going to start
treatment with me in hopes of healing her body so that the cancer does not
return.

History:
5 years ago: Ovarian Cancer + Metastasis in the Peritoneum => both Ovaries,
Fallopian Tubes and Uterus removed + Chemotherapy

Last Summer: One Abdominal Lymph Node enlarged => another course of
Chemotherapy => Lymph Node shrunk

Now: Same Lymph Node is enlarging again 

What I have learned:
Ovarian cancer starts as a Cyst and under pressure the Cyst becomes Cancerous.
 

Questions:
1. I don't understand how pressure changes a Cyst from a sack of fluid to
Metastatic Cancer Cells. Please explain further.

2. Apart from the protocol, what is the best approach working with a client
with Ovarian Cancer?

3. What specific things should I be sure to measure for that are known to
contribute to Ovarian Cancer...I don't want to overlook anything.   

4. Would the treatment be different for a woman who is diagnosed with Ovarian
Cancer who still has her Ovaries and one who has had her Ovaries and Uterus
removed because of Cancer?

    Answers:
    1. When there are Cysts, in general there is a lack of Circulation, whereby
    the Veins are not capable of pumping fluids back against gravity. Oedema
    can be seen as being a result of this malfunction as well.
    If there is no power to pump the fluids back against gravity, the downward
    pressure stays on the system.
    Calcification of the Veinal valves can cause Veinal insufficiency.

    2. To be able to solve these problems, you first need to check if there are
    Calcium Deposits. You do this by testing with Barijodeel or Aurumheel. If
    it matches you use it in treatment. You should do this before using
    remedies like Hamamelis or Mellilotus for strengthening the valves
    themselves. 
   
    And of course you should use Selenium and Berberis for the energy. 
    A lot of Cysts also occur as a result of Fatigue/Exhaustion which can also
    cause a deficiency in the Circulation.
   
    Cysts however can also be caused by Contractions of the Veins whereby a
    narrowing is caused which then also stops the flow of fluids. Gallbladder
    remedy Atropinum is then indicated.
   
    It is widely known that Cancer always occurs after a period or maybe even a
    lifetime of Stress. Stress is also pressure. This Stress is different then
    pressure by gravity but it is still Stress and it is still pressure. 
    The solution is always: 
   
    Increase the performance capability of the body, thereby taking pressure/
    stress away.
   
    Metastasis do not exist. Cancer does not move from one place to another.
    "Metastases" are NEW tumours being caused by the same Malfunction. 
   
    A Tumor is the Result or the Symptom of the disease people call Cancer, it
    is NOT the Cancer itself. Malignancy is a quality of the Tumor, that can be
    changed easily. The aggression can be taken away by removing the cause.
   
    But Chemo adds to the existing problem and it is a known fact, that after
    Chemotherapy it is much harder for the body to heal itself. Sometimes it
    makes the body Therapy Resistant, and biophotons won't help anymore. But
    you can only find that out by treating.

    3. I have already indicated what the causes are. Focus needs to be on:

    1) performance ability of the body
    2) circulation ( arteries and veins)
    3) possible change of lifestyle (lots of rest, relaxed movement and less
    stress)

    4. If you have a client whereby Ovaries etc. are removed already, it is
    very likely that the Cause has not been removed (Circulation etc) so it
    will come back in other places in the body. So also with these patients,
    one needs to focus on the CAUSE.

    * The malignant quality of Cancer can be addressed with Carcinoma Mammae
    (Carcinosin), since we don't have Ovarian Cancer in the Chiren.

    * Emotional issues and causes of Stress in Cancer that you might want to
    talk about with your client:

    - Over responsibility => others needs come always first / over adaption 
    - Inability to say no (guilt)
    - Lost connection with Inner Child
    - Lack of "ME" => identity issues
    - Not standing up for oneself
    - Pleasing and putting on a happy mask
    - Not allowing oneself to rest… 
    - Perfectionism => not allowed to make mistakes
    - Control issues
    - Possible (childhood) abuse, neglect, suffocation…

    Essentially Cancer is about Identity and Boundaries. The right to be
    oneself and to have needs.

    Thank you both for your thorough explanations. I really appreciate your
    responses.

    Further Client Information:
    6 Root Canals => I learned that only recently
    Ostopenia - LINK
    Circulatory issues => her entire life
    Gangrenous Ovarian Cyst => diagnosed and removed at age 18 => It was
    mistaken for Appendicitis so they removed the Appendix first.
     
    Measurement:
    Both toes of her stomach meridians => all bone...no "meat", extremely hard
    to measure => Kieferostitis and Granuloma Denti match.
    All other toes are normal! 
   
    Circulation drops => Barijodeel, Aurumheel 
   
    Hospital information:
    * CAT Scan recently => enlarged Lymph Node is cancerous according to the
    doctor => Without a biopsy I don't know how the doctor can determine that! 
    * Radiation will be started soon => one treatment each day for ten days

    Further Questions:
    1. Can you give me more information about lymph nodes and their connection
    to a cancer?  
   
    2a. Remedies, from the "early release remedy list," that reference
    radiation are: 
    Causticum, Ozaliet, and Viscum 
    Ubichinon is also mentioned for use prior to exposure. 
    Would it be beneficial to treat with these each day after her radiation
    treatments? 
    And Ubichinon prior to her first treatment? 
     
    2b. Are there other remedies, (such as Electro Essence, or others) that
    might be beneficial to give?

    3. Can I give her a full treatment in the middle of her radiation
    treatments, or would it be best to wait until her radiation treatments are
    complete before continuing full Chiren treatments?

    4. Her six root canals, and the condition of her toes, makes me wonder
    about the jaw.
    I wonder if one or more of the root canals could be causal in the ovarian
    cancer?

    I have no idea either how anyone can say that a Tumor or an enlarged Lymph
    Nose is cancerous without a biopsy! Even with a biopsy it is very hard to
    tell….

    Answers:

    1. "Cancerous" means that the Tumor is or can be spreading throughout the
    body…
    To me it means that the underlying Cause is still there, and that new
    Results manifest themselves in different places!
    An enlarged Lymph Node or any Tumor is the Result of a malfunctioning
    system.

    Lymphatic Problem => is a Circulatory Problem => Caused by:
    1. Calcium Blockage in Lymphatic or Blood Vessels
    2. Narrowing of the Lymphatic or Blood Vessels
    3. Weakness of the Valves in her Veins.
    4. Infection/Inflammation

    2a. While a little Radiation on a Tumor might have a beneficial effect, the
    effect of the Radiation on the rest of the body is very detrimental.
    Even if the Radiation is applied locally, it will reach the whole body
    because it always hits the Blood as well. "Spreading of Cancer" can be the
    result.

    My experience is that immediately after a Radiation treatment all the
    points of the body will drop and will respond to Causticum. This seems to
    be sufficient to deal with the consequences….

    2b. Electro Essence has nothing to do with Radioactivity, which is
    something very different than electricity.

    3. You can do this and you might get a good response. This however is not
    my experience. It is an uphill battle. I feel your client has to choose
    between Biontology or Radiation.

    4. The Root Canals can definitely be an underlying Cause of her problems,
    as well as the Circulation and Calcium problems (which also gives Dental
    Issues).

    Hi Carol, 
    As have just dealt with Stage IV ovarian cancer, and had a very large tumor
    taken out that was half cyst and half fibroid, and like your client I had
    everything removed "down there" they can remove, as it was all "cancerous";
     

    I do firmly believe that in addition to the using the Chiren,it is a total
    lifestyle change that must occur when a "symptom" like cancer shows up. We
    can work with people on the chiren for this to aid their body in healing
    but, the big change must be within which is part of the Biontology
    philosophy. 

    I was curious what my surgeon would say when I asked, "so, you are going to
    remove the tumor, but what about the cause of the tumor" and she said,
    "you'll need to check with your consciousness about that." Thats why I
    chose that surgeon. 

    I did no chemo or radiation, just Biontology and natural remedies. I do
    know that stress (that I didn't even realize I was under) contributed to
    this dis-ease. I am writing this because so many of us love what we do,
    (biontology) so we do it more, and more, without regard for rest and
    nutrition, and just nothingness. 
    I fully believe I am alive today after this ordeal because of: 

    1) having the tumor removed, (I did not want to but it was blocking the
    function of other organs ... I believe the body can get rid of the tumor) 

    2) a huge lifestyle change, (including boundaries!) 

    3) a positive belief system 

    4) last but certainly not least, the practice of Biontology, not just using
    the Chiren. 
   
    I am back after 3 months to full health, no evident state of disease and
    just this month happily back to ( reduced hours) work, The body CAN heal.

    Thank you Karolina and Johan for pointing out these emotional and lifestyle
    factors and then the physical issues that follow.

    dear Jan,

    Thank you for writing. For clarity, while you've been treating others and
    receiving treatment, are you saying that you developed ovarian cancer and
    grew a non-cancerous tumor?

    The tumor and ovaries (and everything else) were removed 3 months ago?

    Did you detect the disturbance with the Chiren?
    Are you using the Chiren to help balance your hormones?

    Thank you Jan. Very helpful information. I'm glad you had medical care
    available and in the mix.

     Hi Barbara,
     
    To answer your question, I developed ovarian cancer and a very large tumor
    that also grew into my intestines and blocked both the intestine and the
    kidney, thus the operation, only to find it had affected everything "down
    there".  

    Yes, everything was removed Oct 11.   I did detect  that things were very
    wrong with the chiren but...too late. I had not been treating myself
    because i felt well. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" we say in America,
    and I didn't feel "broken" until all of a sudden. They say ovarian cancer
    is the "silent" killer because you don't have symptoms until for many, too
    late.   I think quite frankly tho' I was too busy to know how I felt.
    Running on will power but, happy to be doing it.  I could not turn anything
    around at all, not my adrenals nothing, so many points were droppingNothing
    I was doing was working. Johan suggested, and I knew I needed, to get the
    tumor out. It was very large.

    After the operation about 2 weeks later I began using both the chiren and
    the principles of biontology, however I developed life threatening, fast
    moving sepsis,(Blood poisoning) and then needed to be (reluctantly) put on
    massive IV antibiotics.  Then, when I got out again I used the instrument
    faithfully, changed my diet, my habits and the way I both work and play.  I
    am doing incredibly well, the physicians cannot believe the recovery.
    Again, I believe it is a lifestyle change, an accounting personally of
    where one is"body mind and spirit" and building the terrain back up with
    biontology.

    I am blessed with another chance to do it all differently, and we are all
    blessed with a  profession that can not only save others lives, but OUR
    lives.

Chiren for Peace?

Sylvia
April 2013 edited January 2014 in General Questions Flag
In thinking that putting a photograph of the classroom children in the foot
plates to create harmony among the class and eliminate bully behaviors I
started wondering if this is something that we can do for world peace as well.

Having had the bombs explode in Boston, a few miles from my home, has prompted
me to ask this question. How can it be done? Would we put a photograph of the
entire world? Piece by piece as in sections? If we all did this wouldn't it
help everyone?

Maybe I am having altruistic fantasies but had to ask.

    Well.... in an Ideal World it would work the way you would like... But from
    a Biontology perspective: the Cause has to be identified and dealt with.
    Otherwise nothing will truly heal.
   
    What is also needed is a willingness and ability in all individuals and
    groups to let go. Remember that Children are relatively free spirits who
    still have a good connection to their Soul. They react easily to the
    treatment, but adults.... not everyone of them will be transformed because
    of the Chiren. 
   
    Think about what is needed for World Peace on an individual level... One
    feels at Peace when there's at least enough to eat, shelter, freedom to 
    develop one self, a feeling of being wanted (not judged, excluded,
    exploited), knowing that what one does in life has meaning...  And you
    could think of many more of those factors. 
    If you take a closer look at these conditions, you'll see that the cause of
    unhappiness/lack of peace lies in the way the whole System of countries/
    borders/cultures/money/devision of resources etc. is structured. The rich
    West plunders development countries for their resources (oil, diamonds,
    gold, food, labour). 
   
    In a balanced world there would be less luxury in the West.... for change
    to happen, the prosperous people have to be ready to live a little bit less
    extravagant.... this will meet resistance for sure, since this extravagance
    is now considered "Normal" and a "Right". 
   
    When people are suppressed, exploited, see there families suffer, are not
    allowed to have different ways of living and are discriminated of course
    they get angry. So unless circumstances of suppressed groups change, many
    of the people within these groups will resist change too.

    Terrorism, Fanaticism, (Religious) Extremism.... they only grow in very
    unhappy people and cultures. 
   
    Did you know that the Dutch were listed as one of the most happy cultures
    in the world? We had a system that made everybody feel save financially,
    there was a lot of tolerance always and good education. The last decennia
    it was almost impossible to find Dutch people to really stand up against
    anything!! There was no impulse to fight whatsoever and no extremism. We
    had a very tolerant image. Right now the feeling of safety is changing and
    prosperity is declining and all of a sudden we see anger, extremism and
    fighting spirit reappear...  Hope this makes my point clear?     
   
    In a way the imbalance of the World has become very "Structural". This
    Physical Reality needs to change along with the Awareness that has to grow.
    This is the only way change will come... I believe change is already
    happening though.

    So what I personally believe, what will happen if you treat "The World" in
    this way is that you could initiate, or rather hasten, the Self Healing of
    the World that has already began. But it will give a lot of Detox and
    Healing reactions ;-). I believe anger, war and terrorism are often karmic
    (reaction to an action). Not as a punishment, but as an energy that wants
    to correct an imbalance. The imbalance we have right now was created by
    Capitalism. 
    When a body fights parasites it creates a fever. When the World fights
    parasites it might create.... Wars? Earthquakes? Storms? Who knows...
   
    You know how the expansive Wood energy reacts on the constrictive Metal
    energy!? With Anger!
    I think the World has a serious Liver/Gallbladder problem ;-).

    Inversion that will have a Similar effect on the Earth and a Spin Inversion

    places so had not had a chance to return. 

    Costa Rica has often been listed as having the happiest people in the world
    in the last few years. There is a very passive energy there in general,
    sometimes I'm not sure if that is good.

    Migraines are caused by a combination of the Gallbladder and Stomach
    meridians, but I do not see the Stomach mentioned. So I wonder if they are
    really migraines she is suffering from or just a simple headache.

    For the Insulin point on the left hand (hypoglycaemia), we never use
    gallbladder remedies. Gallbladder remedies are used for the hypo-insulin on
    the right hand. The hypo point generally responds to the remedying of other
    glands on the left hand. If those points are balanced , the Insulin Point
    usually comes right as well.

    Causticum is for the effects of radiation. You could try to match it on
    many points. But I do not know if it would show after so many years.

    Scar treatments should always be first, immediately after the Whiplash
    sessions.

    If someone is having  localized radiation treatment on deep skin cancer
    would you treat the skin directly with the rods using just the light on a
    standard program? Would you treat the skin lesioned area directly at all
     OR would you just follow protocol of testing using rods on hands and
    footplates on feet?.

    Localised light treatment can be done but it is insufficient. Even when
    radiation is localised, the effect is never localised. The radiation always
    affects the blood and via the blood the whole body gets affected.

    The effects of the radiation need to be treated using the Standard
    Treatment.

    With any type of cancer, the lesions or tumours are the symptom and you
    need to treat the cause.

Bladder Infection - on and off for years

Beate
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Therapy Resistance Flag
Woman 50 years, a friend of mine, has had Biophoton Therapy on and off a couple
of years. She starts in a new job soon, and has been on off sick leave more
then a year. I have tried to help her, but have not succeeded. She feels well 2
/3 days after each Biophoton Treatment. 

She sees a acupuncturist twice a week, for years....I have not treated her the
last 12 months....  however I feel sorry for her that she has such Bladder
problems...draft is the worse for her.

Symptoms: Bladder pain (steady, not burning or cramping), sensitivity to draft.

What do you think would help her? Thanks for any suggestion. Beate

    I would follow the standard protocol and look at the 5 element theory to
    see what the underlying cause may be. You may be treating symptoms but not
    the cause and that may be why she is better temporarily but it does not
    sustain.

    That is why I referred to the 5 element teaching. It may be that the cause
    is hidden and that you need to look at the organs that are adjacent to the
    bladder such as gallbladder, etc.

    Good luck,

    Hi Beate,

    How many treatments did you gave her in a series of once a week? And did
    she continue with the acupuncture while she was being treated with
    Biophoton therapy?

    What did you find in the past to be the cause of her Bladder Infections?
    What did you measure?
  • 
    Beate
    March 2013 Flag
    Hi Karolina,

    I am in Spain now and my details about the client is in Oslo.
    Do you ask how many series of treatments 7 days apart ?
    On and off two series a 6 treatments every year for 3-4 years.

    Every year minus 2012/20013 she has had treatments on and off, but
    sometimes more then 7 days apart . She is director of communications in a
    big company and travels a lot, so sometimes the treatment get lost.
    I have not commented the acupuncturist other when she mentioned him and
    pointed out that we have the same opinion about her.I have a feeling he
    means a lot to her too. I did not feel comfortable, but concentrated on the
    biophoton treatment instead.

    Since the client is a friend of mine, and is on a sickleave now, before she
    starts a new job in May,
     I have thought a lot about her condition. Also where I have failed myself
    with the Chiren treatments.
    Yesterday we spoke on the phone, and I asked her if she still get
    acupuncture. She says yes, and when I asked if she is sure that is good for
    her she says YES.

     The cause is in my opinion, since you ask is not onely, but also linked to
     childhood traume connected to her mother....she is holding back and she is
    a controlled and likes to
    please people, and specially her husband and two children (and her
    therapists).

    She has always been sensitive to draft and temperature changes. All year
    around she dresses in wool to protect herself. Her skin is delicate, white
    and a bit swollen.
    This improved during the her sessions with me, but it took more then a year
    to  keep it stable with Chiren.

    What I measure? I can not recall in this moment, other then that her liver
    had a period of hiding behind green points.I have been slow to treat the
    liver, in retrospective I can argue.
    The strange thing is that the drops got restored more or less ,
    most of them, after each biophoton treatment !

    This client tells the therapy has helped her a lot, and she is much better
    and has more energy.

    You see Karolina, it is very easy to see what you have not done when
    thinking back of the treatments.
    I should have been more strict, and asked her if she would try just one
    therapy at a time. I would have, but I discovered after a long time first
    that she saw the acupuncturist on a regular base.
    She also has followed me as a therapist with Chiren, from day one so she is
    special to me.She comes to see me in Spain in April, not for treatments I
    hope.

    Thanks for asking and wanting to help :)  Beate

    Acupuncture can be very helpful in some conditions, although often it
    remains symptom treatment. It is more the matter of mixing therapies that
    is the problem. This is never a good idea especially if you both work on an
    energetic level.
    If after treatment you've measured that everything has balanced... what
    else is there to do but disrupting this balance again if you then start
    needling?

    So this might be a cause for not getting optimal results. But maybe you
    have overlooked some things too. I can't tell since I don't have any other
    symptoms or measurements of this lady.

    Recurring Bladder Infections are often related to dysbiosis (unhealthy
    bacterial climate) in the Intestines. So there might have been Intestinal
    Inflammation (Appendicitis)? And a lack of Good Bacteria?
    Do you remember treating Food Poisonings a lot? 

    Childhood Trauma sets someone up for an ongoing tension and high stress
    level throughout life. So it is also very important to work on Gallbladder
    and Adrenals I feel. And then by guiding her with questions, you might
    assist awareness around her way of coping with life (energy on the outside
    because of trauma, has to go more to the inside...).

    How is her Stomach? High stress exhausts Stomach Acid production and
    promotes inflammation throughout the body. Also without enough Stomach
    Acid, food bacteria are not killed and can go freely into the Intestines to
    cause Dysbiosis and Inflammation.
    The Earth element (Stomach) is the element to look at when there's Pleasing
    Behaviour and a tendency to be Overbearing towards loved ones. 

    Enjoy your time of friendship and lock the Chiren away ;-)  If she wants to
    be treated again in the future, I'd really like to hear your follow up!

    Karolina, you are so right in your thinking.

    Yes a lot of Food Poisoning, and especially Listeria.

    I have onely treated Appendicites and all other -ites. What I have missed
    is the other two, Necroticans/Chronic...what a shame.

    You see, in the training we were thought to be very modest ....:) at least
    how I remember it.
    From the comments in the Forum I see there is a lot for me to learn.
    Grrrrr......thanks :))

    How were you trained to be modest? 
    The drops should mainly be balanced by Nosodes and not by Supports or Bach/
    Bush, because they work the strongest.
    It is still advised to try and find the biggest effect with as little
    Nosodes as possible. But you do need to use the necessary nosodes, the ones
    that you measure and no formula's. So if you have many drops on both Large
    and Small Intestines (and elsewhere) you should try Appendicitis
    Necroticans first. When this matches, usually it will balance many
    points... (the other Appendicitises are usually not needed in this case,
    but might show up in the next session)

    Interesting what you mention about the Appendicitis Necroticans, since that
    one we learned to be careful about, when measured. Many questions about
    that one and the cancer frequences.
    The teacher said that the person needs to go to the hospital if
    Appendicites Necroticans measure. It could even be too late......
    So again thank you very much for guiding me in the bright -light direction 
    :) Beate

    If this is information you got from your teacher, then it was a mistake.
    Johan's experience and teachings are completely different.

    Appendicitis Necroticans is measured, and has to be treated frequently in
    many chronic health issues to have good results. It is not something to be
    worried about if you measure it, usually it will change quality after one
    treatment (then you measure Chronic Appendicitis). 
    Only in very rare cases even after treating 5 times once a week you keep
    measuring Appendicitis Necroticans. When this is the case you can start to
    worry and send your client to the doctor.

    Also you don't have to worry if you measure the Cancer remedies. It doesn't
    mean that your client has cancer at all. Carcinoma Coli for example is an
    excellent remedy for Colitis Ulcerosa or even Constipation!

    Answer:
    A Remedy of the cigarette, some smoke and the ashes can be made with the
    Neutralization program.
   
    This will help reduce the desire to smoke, but your client really needs to
    make the choice to quit, since there is also a psychological pattern that
    needs to be broken. This pattern can only be addressed if the client really
    wants to quit.

    Hi Christian,

    Can you tell me more about the sessions, what remedies you have measured
    and treated with? If I don't have an oversight on what you have done, an
    answer will be based on possibilities, good guesses, but won't help you to
    get insight in what you have done or improve you treatments.

    It is quite possible that you just lifted the suppression by getting the
    hormonal system working again, but didn't address the other systems in the
    right order/way for example. 
    A rise in blood sugar is often caused by stress... this can have many
    causes, but it might be simply that you've lifted suppression and the
    underlying imbalance is exposed. It might also be that you treated the
    Liver too soon, or that you didn't support the organs that needed it the
    most.
    Like I wrote... all speculations. I like all the information you gathered
    so a real Biontology assessment can be made. ;-)

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    October 2013 edited October 2013 Flag
    Hi Christian,

    Thank you for the additional information. 
    From the information you have given I note several things

    1. You did measure for Whiplash the first treatment, since both Thyroid and
    Para-Thyroid were dropping. 
    I don't see those drops in the other Sessions though, so something else
    might have caused the Thyroid to drop, but it is something to be aware
    of... following protocol you should have administered a Whiplash treatment
    to see whether this resolved the Thyroid/Para-Thyroid drops before
    measuring any remedy.

    2. I also see you have used many Heavy Metals and hardly any of the
    Gallbladder Nosodes - or Supports (Billiary Cirrhosis, Cholecystitis,
    Calculi Billiaris, Adenoma Gallenblase, Atropinum, Chelidonium, Injeel
    Chol), The Gallbladder meridian on both feet continues to show (the same?)
    drops in all sessions, and when this happens the underlying cause has not
    been addressed.
    Since it is very important to balance the Gallbladder system in case of
    diabetes, it needs focus in every treatment as long as you measure drops
    and/or symptoms are still there.
   
    3. Using a lot of Heavy Metal Remedies and Toxins (Insecticides), will urge
    the body to mobilize these, causing new stress to the Liver/Gallbladder
    system. It is more gentle and effective to focus on the Yang Organs that
    are unbalanced -in this case the Gallbladder- first. 
   
    So to summarise and answer your questions:

    'Is it normal that her blood sugar starts to rise?" 
    - Extra stress to the body will almost always cause a rise in blood sugar
    in clients with diabetes.
    In this case the extra stress might be that you're client was treated with
    too many Toxins/Metals, too soon.
   
    "I want to support her with Gallbladder remedies to lower her blood sugars,
    is that the right approach?"
    - Yes you are completely on the right track with this question. The
    Gallbladder should have the main focus, but not only by using Support
    remedies, you'll also need to find the right Gallbladder Nosodes. 
   
    "How many treatments does it take to lower the blood sugars again?"
    - With a treatment that addresses the cause of the stress, the blood sugar
    can be lowered again in just one session (to the level it was before
    treatment at least, the recovery of diabetes will take more time0

    I hope this answers you questions and look forward to read about your
    experiences with this clients in coming sessions.

    P.S. I wonder what point you refer to with "Peritoneum"... Liver? Small
    Intestines...? It is easier if you just refer to a meridian and then, if
    you feel it is relevant, specify with the point.

Waky Waky

February 2013 edited January 2014 in Programs Flag
I have a client who has heard of the Waky Waky treatment and would like an
explanation from Johan (that I can read to him) about what it is and when it is
appropriate.

Also I have heard that it can be done up to 30 times and would like
clarification on that and how to know how many times to use it, if appropriate
and... Is it done holding the rods.  It was once described to me as holding the
rods on each temple and running  it.  So, wondering about that also.   

I have tried to remember Johan's explanations as sort of "Waky Waky up the
consciousness"..is that what we are doing?

Thank you.

    program?

    Does one need only one round of Neutralization Program while holding two
    glass rods? and what kind of result would practitioner expect? how do we
    measure it immediately after?

    I remember Johan told us about experimenting with group of practitioners
    when they repeated Neutralization Program on themselves 10 times. 
    Clarification on this matter, please (of course they were not in coma)

    In the class Inter-relationships 9/30 ( I believe it was taped) it was
    described as for a coma or the unconscious as you said above, and it was
    also said to hold the rod in the hands and can be run as many as 20 to 30
    times.  
    I have no idea why my client want to know. Perhaps he heard it in a
    lecture. A number of people ask for clarifications of what they hear in
    lectures.  He asked me to get a an explanation on how it works and why it
    works. That is all I know.   I was not sure, so I was asking that and ....
    if it is for the unconscious as in knocked out unconscious, or also for the
    person who is not a conscious being.

    The practitioner who was discussing the perhaps "hold it to the temples and
    try it" was not directing me to do so but it was a discussion about a
    client who was not fully "present" but resided somewhere else in her mind.

    Hello Yelyena and Jan,

    The Waky Waky is done until the person in coma regains consciousness.

    Yes there has been an experiment like that. It was only a one time
    experiment and none of the people got a higher consciousness afterward.
    Some of them (only 10%, 4 out of a group of 40) only temporarily got a
    little bit of a stoned feeling, I didn't notice a huge shift in presence or
    consciousness.
   
    People have experienced that the Chiren raises their consciousness, but
    that is just by the normal treatment procedure.

    What do you mean by not fully present? 
   
    When a client is not fully present, it is important to measure what is
    going on.
    It can be hypoglycaemia, low blood pressure or other things too....

    Thank you for the clarification.  Maybe thats what my client wanted ...
    just joking about that  -

    think that is why he was asking.

    The first thing that fell into my head is that this man need support to
    learn to trust his own body.
    To get there he needs time to position himself well in the therapy room and
    be present here and now.

    I would go for Whiplash and Spin Inversion and Spin and Spin again until he
    is in resonance with himself.
    Asking about daily life and make his body give the answers he need to stand
    upright.

    I am sure he has seen a doctor, taken tests and so on. I always ask this.

    The symptom of iron deficiency can be caused by the bowel condition. 

    Since the Appendicitis Necroticans keeps showing up I think you need more
    focussed support to fight the Appendix inflammation along with the nosode.
    I would use Chelidionium or Belladonna (inflammation), Sutoxol
    (self-intoxification because of longstanding inflammation), Mucosa,
    Tonsilla Compositum (same tissue as Appendix & improves immune function)
    and maybe the nosode Diphterinum since this is made from necrotic tonsil
    tissue.

    Gelsemium has Rhus Toxicodendron  as an ingredient and might help with the
    severe redness, swelling and cracking of the skin. Emotionally it acts on
    suppressed anger, which is very likely an issue when you stay in a stagnant
    situation like an unhappy marriage.

    If the client has removed the Appendix, is it always the Chronic
    Appendicitis that is needed to remove the energetic disturbanse?

    Can it ever be Appendicitis Necroticans or Appendicitis?

    It can be all three of those, you just have to measure to figure out which
    one is needed to correct the Appendix point.

Symptoms: anxiety, sleep difficulties, sweaty palms, stress "all his life" as

Medical interventions: hernia repair at age 5 and (mother says there is no
scar)  He also has some large silver fillings (mercury).

Measured twice: no drops which doesn't make sense. 

I tried Viscum, Plumbum and Atropinum, but this made no change. After Johans
comment about sweaty palms I wonder if I'm measuring skin resistance instead of
AC points. 
Should I have him try to dry his hands really well? Any other tips? 

I've treated a scar on his arm and done footplates without any remedies. He got
noxious after 5 minutes the first time so I stopped. The second time he
tolerated 16 minutes of the dyslexia program. 
I haven't been able to treat a scar from the hernia surgery because the mother
says there's no scar.

IF I have to treat symptomatically how would one proceed?

    Hi Toril,

    I'll let Johan answer the therapy question, but I'd like to clarify your
    question on skin resistance. 

    We always measure the skin resistance. When we connect the probe and the
    metal rod with the body, an electrical circuit is formed and a very small
    current is sent through the body. Since the body always strives to
    counteract sudden changes to maintain the environment as it is, it will
    actively try to counteract the effect of the electrical impulse. If the
    measured point is healthy it manages to do so and if it is not the skin
    resistance changes and this is why the sound doesn't hold..... and then
    you'll hear or see a drop. 

    Now to come back to the sweaty hands: water is a better conductor than skin
    and electricity always seeks the easiest way to travel. So if you measure
    wet hands you don't measure the points accurately anymore since the
    electricity will go towards all points along the skin instead of just
    traveling through that one point and then through the body. The sounds will
    be very high if the skin is too wet since there's little resistance.

    Drying the hands is a good idea, but since sweat is easily created you'll
    have to do that maybe several times. And another thing is that the probe,
    with children in general, should only lightly touch the skin to get a good
    measurement. You can try if when you adjust the pressure a little bit (but
    always keep it stable when you start listening), some points do drop.

    I just want to add that sweaty palms and soles is one sign of Tuberculosis,
    so is it possible that this child has a TB miasma and running both TBs
    might be helpful? I have done this with success. It stopped the sweating
    that had been a lifetime problem. Curious to know what Johan thinks about
    this.

    I think I read this on the last forum, to treat yourself with a blank 2-7
    year program before your treatment if you have problems geting
    measurements. Is this right? Can it be if you are trying to hard as a
    terapist? I tried this with my patient last to times after i read it on the
    old forum and i got measurements, but of course it could be a diffrent
    reason why it started working.
    Just wondering:)

    Kathryn: That sounds like a really good solution and if you've tried it and
    it worked right away it is a good tip to get better measurements in such a
    case.

    Did you run the two TB's on a short program just before treatment and were
    you able to measure right after that or did you have to wait until the next
    session before the sweating stopped?

    Liselotte: The treatment without remedies is a solution for when someone
    has bad circulation and because of that very dry skin. This makes it very
    hard to measure (low sounds) and preparing with a blank treatment will give
    more energy to the body and improve circulation, which will make the
    measurement easier.

    Karolina: My doctor father told me about the TB and sweating when I was a
    child. Never forgot it. When someone has profuse sweating of palms and
    soles (had 6 people like that in 15 months), I test both TBs together on
    the lungs and the TW (which might have or not have drops), and if there are
    no drops when I measure - I use these two. I included these as part of
    the 10-minute standard treatment in the 1st session. By the 2nd time, they
    tell me the sweating has improved considerably. So, I run them again on the
    2-7 for a few more treatments, and this seems to stop the sweating in its
    tracks. The only downside is that women then tend to want to wear high
    heels, because now they don't slip and slide in them! Hmmm...how to change
    women's minds about how unhealthy that is?!

    Ah vanity! ;-)  But that's all a personal choice, we just help to restore
    the health to a level that clients are happy with. If certain unhealthy
    behaviour is continued/started the body probably will create problems
    again. When the heels start to give issues she will come back ....

    So the TB is a good tip for the symptom of sweaty hands, but it doesn't
    allow a proper reading right away when there's a measurement problem
    because of the sweat. For this, drying the hands when it's needed and
    applying only very light pressure on the pen seems to be the best answer. 

    When this doesn't work and you have to go by symptoms for treatment it
    seems to be a good idea to include TB, so at least the next treatment
    sweating won't be a problems.

    Thank you very much Kathryn for this very good tip.

    Toril to get back to your initial case:

    I feel all symptoms you're discribing have a lot to do with a Gallbladder
    imbalance and I would treat for Adrenal insufficiency at the same time. 
    So if you have to pick remedies to treat with without having reliable
    measurements you can use:

    Billiary Cirrhosis, Cholecystitis, Chelidonium, Injeel Chol, Atropinum,
    Selenium, Berberis (works for both Adrenals and Gallbladder!), Tonico

    more centered, not as easily frustrated.
   
    Thanks for the TB and drying his hands tip :). His mother also has sweaty
    palms. I'll also try Gallbladder / Adrenal remedies IF the high

    3rd visit today. 
   
    Finally got a good reading. Endorphin high resolved. Palms and soles not
    sweaty. Interestingly they had their smart meter (wire less device that
    monitors electric/gas consumption) removed from his bedroom wall yesterday
    and Mom says the room 'feels' better.  Not sure if this has something to do
    with endorphin high resolving. 
   
    Drops Left Hand:
    Triple Warmer - 2,5,6 from hand                                            
    Small Intestines - 1,3,4
    Heart - 2,3,4,5
   
    Right Hand:
    No drops
   
    Left Foot: 
    Pancreas meridian - drops
   
    Right Foot:
    No drops
   
    Measured:
    Appendicitis., Chronic Appendicitis., Brucellosis, 
   
    Supported on 2-7 treatment with:
    Belladonna, Echinacea  
   
    Dyslexia treatment: 
    Viscum, Thalamus, Atropinum 16 1/2 minutes tolerated well.
   
    Prior to visit Mom reports he is more centered and less easily frustrated. 
    Last night seemed to gradually fall asleep in bedroom instead of getting
    'reved' up.   
   
    Thanks for all the good suggestions.

    Hi Toril,

    Matching Appendicitis and Brucellosis to correct the Adrenal Glands and the
    Parathyroid seems to me highly unlikely. Did you check after the treatment
    if these remedies worked?

    You always have to correct the hormonal system first and Appendicitis is
    not the first thing to think about. You always first test all childrens
    diseases/vaccinations and on the Parathyroid also Serum Ovile and if they
    don't match you start to look for other remedies.
    It sometimes does happen that a tonsillitis disturbs the Parathyroid and
    maybe this is why the Appendicitis remedies matched. You should however
    first try Chronic Tonsillitis then.
    On dropping points on the Adrenals you always first try Selenium and
    Berberis and usually they match.

    There still seems to be a little confusion around the endorphin mask and
    wrong readings because of wet hands, since you say "endorphin high
    resolved". 

    Endorphin masks are rare (about 1%) and highs (sounds) in the measurement 
    are very, very rare, we almost never get a high reading. Everything is just
    balanced with an endorphin mask. So normal balanced readings, no drops, but
    also no highs!

    If you get high readings it is because of the fluids on the skin or you
    press to hard.

    What was resolved was the sweaty hands and not an "endorphin high", and
    this is why you get better readings.

    To find out if the smart meters were the cause of the sweaty hands you have
    to ask when that symptom started. If it was just after they were installed
    you know that this was the cause.

    It is likely the smart meters caused extra stress in the boy, but since he
    has been stressed all his life it is not the core issue.

    OK thank you Johan,
   
    Maybe still some fluid on skin as some points screaming and easy to hear
    with minimal pressure but much less sweaty than before - not noticeable to
    me as a problem before he was nearly dripping.
   
    I try very hard with children to not push hard although I do have that
    tendency to want to push firmly. He said ouch once. I will try harder to 
    not push firmly because if a child says "OUCH!" once there is a chance they
    won't come back. 
    I make gentle contact with the full circumference of the probe then slide
    in to hear the AC point. In order to have constant pressure you need to be
    a little firm but not hard. I'm working on this.

    I thought you said Appendicitis could interfere anywhere an correct a lot
    of drops. 
    So after Spin Inversion treatment, Whiplash, Scars and Ozaliet (IF
    everything still drops fast) I usually try the Appendicitises(3X), one at a
    time starting with Appendicitis Necroticans then Chronic Tonsillitis/
    Tonsillitis, then I go to Vaccincations, Childhood Illnesseses but I could
    change that in children.. 
   
    Unfortunately I don't recall everything I tried and in which order but I do
    have a routine which seems necessary as a beginner. I need to go back to
    using my "cheat sheet". 
   
    He did wiggle some perhaps making measuring more difficult but it seemed
    easy...For Small Intestines left hand I went through the list in the Chiren
    where Appendicitis comes first but I think I already had that in the slot
    then Brucella Abortus Bang corrected some drops on Small Intestines when I
    looked down again Brucellosis was in slot not Brucella Abortus Bang, so I
    was surprised but it corrected a drop(s)
   
    I always check after treatment to make sure it took. The treatment did take
    in this child. Recently I had 2 people who didn't 'take'. One was in hidden
    spin and resolved after 3X spin inversion. 
   
    Also can you confirm that the Adrenal Point is just under the nail 4 th
    finger on the right not on the side of the finger as some instructor has
    taught us?
   
    It seems critical to me that our technique be checked by one of the pros
    and the location of the AC points.It was good that Nora did this at the
    refresher course.
   
    I also wonder if there can be a "wigi board" effect. You WANT the therapy
    to improve drops and clinical outcome so could your subconscious influence
    pressure/ duration so it sounds good? I know it is important to be open and
    objective. This can be a challenge to know about oneself.
   
    Also Sophie will teach SF2 group about Bush and Bach this weekend but you
    don't want us to use these til we are more proficient with Nosodes is that
    correct? 
   
    Clarification appreciated.
   
   
    Thanks again Johan!  Toril

    Hi Toril,

    OUCH is a good sign that you press too hard ;-) With a child that already
    has sweaty hands you hardly need any pressure at all.

    Appendicitis Necroticans or Chronic Appendicitis (and also Chronic
    Tonsillitis) can correct a lot of drops but usually not the Parathyroid or
    the Adrenals. Also you only start to look for Appendicitis after you have
    dealt with the vaccinations/childhood diseases. The Hormonal System has to
    be cleared up first and the steps to take in testing are:

    1. Childhood Diseases/Vaccinations (for the Adrenals Selenium and Berberis
    first)
    2. Toxins/ Heavy Metals (for the Adrenals Sexual Gland issues first)
    3. Other issues...


    The Adrenal point is in the lower corner of the nail and not on the side of
    the nail... that's too high. For some reason there has been
    miscommunication about this. The location of acupuncture points receives
    far more attention in the new courses, and the measurement too. If anyone
    feels he/she needs extra guidance on measuring techniques please contact
    the IABS and we might be able to organize something.

    The "wigi board" effect, as you call it, is a big problem in Biontology. It
    is a common mistake to focus on restoring drops too much, or to "project"
    an outcome of the measurements to prove own ideas. Projecting ideas can be
    in the way of receiving information openly and measuring objectively. This
    is why we are going to implement a course in Objectivity in future
    trainings.

    The Bush and Bach can be used, but they have their place in the treatment
    only as support. So it is nice to know something about them even when
    you've not yet mastered the Nosodes. 
    You can, for example, measure for a Bush or Bach remedy in the beginning of
    your treatment to see which one is most supporting, take it out to use it
    later on as a support on the footplates, and then wait for 5 minutes (or
    whatever length of time is needed) until all points drop again so you can
    do a proper treatment with the Nosodes without the flower remedy masking
    anything.

    However if the physical "anchor" is still there, emotional problems are not
    likely to be resolved. So before using these remedies, it is best to have
    done about 3 sessions without them.

    Another way to look at sweaty palms and sweaty feet is from the point of
    view of not being able to hold water. Protein holds water. People who are
    wet donot digest protein well. And then we need to dig deeper to get to the
    cause.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    February 2013 edited February 2013 Flag
    I don't think that protein deficiency is a direct cause for sweating, if
    there's a lack of protein in the body the body swells and people get
    oedema. The lack of protein in the blood (like albumin) will cause the
    water to be drawn into the tissues. 
    The blood proteins are produced in the Liver and that is why severe Liver
    disease can cause oedema and ascites. (portal vein obstruction is another
    reason...).  Childeren in development countries with severe protein
    malnutrition also get an ascites belly because of this. They don't sweat
    abnormally.

    Not only protein draws water, salts do too.

    So sweating has a different cause. The control over the sweat glands lies
    in the Hypothalamus and if regulation is healthy one starts sweating when
    the body temperature rises. Low grade inflammation and fevers might cause
    sweating or a Hypothalamus function that is not in order.

    Another type of sweating are night sweats or sweating without activity.
    This is caused by Adrenal disorders and stress.

    4th and final visit for now. 

    Only found 2 drops one on Pineal gland and other on upper Vein meridian
    right hand. They resolved without putting remedies in. I measured drops and
    when I went back after a full assessment they were gone. Acupressure? 
   
    I didn't find matches with the above suggestions but thanks anyways for
    next time I have someone with sweaty hands and feet. They are much less
    moist now.

    His sleep has improved. Gradually falls asleep instead of waking up once he
    goes to bed. Less anxious & less fearful. Greater joy.. More grounded.
    Don't see the facial twitching anymore. 

    Is he 'cured'? I don't know. Is he asymptomatic? Well many parents have an
    expectation of the perfect child...he still says he has some fear issues.
    But he would rather like to 'hang out' than have more Biophoton sessions
    for now. He also said he 'felt' energy between the glass rods.

    I've never seen this. 

    A drop on a meridian doesn't just react on some pressure of the probe, so I
    think there's some inconsistency in your measurement.

    You can use Stetzer filters to reduce dirty electricity although a building

    Yes, I found that the Stetzer filters put me into spin inversion.  I had a

    Another possibility is a very long ethernet cable - although this is not
    ideal.  

    I can't use wi-fi, but can still use my long cable when that's the only

    Stetzer filters can be helpful in reducing dirty electricity ( that is
    extremely low frequency electromagnetic radiation) BUT if you have a wiring
    problem in your wall you will create magnetic fields , this can increase 
    likelihood of Spin Inversion. SO Stetzer filters should only be used if you
    have a Trifield meter to check magnetic fields before and after
    installation and weekly thereafter. I had this problem in my kitchen so I
    never use Stetzer filters there but be aware sometimes plugging in
    appliances can do the same thing. So it is important to measure if you have
    recurrent Spin Inversion.

Vasectomy and Possible Remedy Resistance - WHY ?

janjan
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Therapy Resistance Flag
I have a client, a homeopath, who wants and explanation he can read as to why a
client may be remedy resistant if having a vasectomy.  I remember hearing it
but I do not want to explain it incorrectly. 

Also you said this  - "With vasectomy, the trouble is not if someone can hold a
remedy. It's all about the physical body being able to respond to it. Even if
the energetic body does respond and is healed completely, the physical symptoms
can remain."    

What is it about the vasectomy and the sperm being reabsorbed that may create a
problem.  

Thanks, I'll relay what you share here.

    Hi Jan,

    This is a theory purely based on the experience that men with a vasectomy
    didn't physically respond to the therapy. Johan theorised that this might
    be caused by the body working against itself. 

    Reabsorption of sperm happens in all men since sperm production goes on
    even if there's no ejaculation (and men who don't ejaculate every day do
    exist ;-)) But often (not always) after vasectomy the body starts to
    produce anti-sperm antibodies. So sperm is produced and destroyed at the
    same time. This might be the cause for the therapy resistance - the body
    working against itself. 
    Maybe the men who react to a vasectomy with the production of anti-sperm
    were the ones more prone to other imbalances too and that's why the
    observation was there that vasectomy caused therapy resistance in almost
    all men with a vasectomy... who knows.

    It is now observed by practitioners that sometimes men with a vasectomy do
    react on the treatment. Johan also suspects this might be because the
    Chiren is more powerful than previous instruments.

    I currently have 2 clients, who have had vasectomy.

    One has   a prostate cancer removed over a year ago, and his PSA was fine
    right up until December, when it suddenly started to rise. He began in
    biophoton therapy , and he says, he has never felt better and will continue
    in treatment whether PSA rises or falls.
   
    The second client has high blood pressure and get 4 different kinds of
    strong medicine. Already after the first treatment decreased both his blood
    pressure and pulse, and after 3 treatments, he had only to take half of his
    medication, because his blood pressure was so low that he felt dizzy and
    unwell.
    So sometimes works treatment even though, the man has a vasectomy :)

    I wrote "Johan suspects this might..", so this is only guessing. Not

    From what I have seen, the Chiren, Starlight and Chikey all are equally
    powerful... How to measure the difference in effectiveness is difficult...
    They all create amazing results, I started out on the Starlight and had no
    complaints except for it to be a little slow!

    Johan tried to find an explanation, as to why sometimes Clients with
    Vasectomy can be helped now.... So it is not a definite indication for
    Therapy Resistance anymore.
    Because of this Johan wonders if maybe the Chiren is more powerful…. 
    Although the technology is the same inside, the Chiren design is based on

    If someone with a vasectomy chooses to go ahead with treatment, do we need
    to treat the scar (if there is one)?
  •

    Vasectomy only leaves a minor scar at the back of the scrotum, which will
    not cause obstruction in the meridian flow. 

    So you don't need to treat it unless the scar itself creates discomfort… 
    Sometimes men experience ongoing testicular pain in which case you might
    want to treat locally.

    Well, you can look it up on the internet and see just where the scar is.
    For me, once I looked, I decided to use procranium.  Seemed a lot simpler
    and a lot more comfortable for the client. ;-)

    True, I would only treat locally when really necessary and if it is (for
    example when someone creates excessive scar tissue) , you can also leave
    the room and tell the client to hold the rods or wires himself. But the
    location of this scar of course is hard to reach….

    The small external Scar in Vasectomy is less likely to be causal of the
    testicular pain then the internal ones, so using Procranium in the regular
    treatment seems like a good idea. 

    Thanks for the suggestions Jan. Internet is a good resource of this kind of
    information LINK (pictures of vasectomy scars)

    Thanks.  I had looked it up online.  The more recent procedures seem to not
    leave much scar tissue, but just thought I would see what your experience
    has been. 

    Some acupuncture sites indicate that these scars should be treated.  Of
    course, I like the idea of using procranium in the hand treatment.  :)

    Thanks.

    What about circumcision leaving scar tissue. Could this prevent healing? I
    have a client who has had a circumcision done in his adult age, he had a
    balanitis.

    He has an elarged prostate and inflammation of the testicals and already
    had these before the circumcision.

    Concerning the reabsorption of sperm, maybe this is a result of endorphin
    masking since the testosterone is a  'steroidal substance.

    Vasectomy only leaves a minor scar at the back of the scrotum, which will
    not likely cause obstruction in the meridian flow.

    I have never had anybody where the circumcision prevented healing but bad
    circulation could be responsible for this.

    An enlarged prostate is the same as a cyst. Cysts are caused by a bad
    circulation. Inflammation of the testicles could possibly also be caused by
    this.

    With a vasectomy, there is not a reabsorption of sperm but there is
    production of "anti-sperm", thus neutralizing the sperm. This is at least
    what I understood from various studies that I have read.

    Did you measure everything? Did you measure all the 5 "pox" remedies, like
    you call them? 
    It looks like you used a recipe. There are no recipes, so please do not get
    tempted to put remedies in without measuring. This will not benefit your
    results.
   
    I would try:
    Rubella (German measles) especially on the Nervous System
    On which hand are the Small and Large Intestines dropping?
    Circulation: Baryodeel, Aurumheel, Atropinum
    Heart: Strep and Staph

    In Meniere's there's always a Gallbladder imbalance. But I do not see any
    drops on the feet meridians. The Gallbladder must drop in this condition.

    My personal experience is that Meniere's can be caused by an infection of a
    cavitation in the jaw.

    A dentist opened the area of the wisdom tooth which was removed some 30
    years earlier, found a small infection in the bone of that jaw area.... 
    cleaned it and from that time I had no more vertigo.

    March 2013 edited February 2014 Flag
    In Biontology, I've seen all complaints of Meniere's disappear just by
    treating the Gallbladder.

    Tooth/jaw problems might be a stressor and thus influence the Gallbladder,
    but I personally haven't found a connection in measurements or a need to
    treat them. 

    However, if there's an infection in the jaw causing the Meniere's you'll
    measure it on the tooth point on the Stomach meridian and Kieferostitis
    will match. So the body will guide you to the problem anyway...

Questions:
1. Is there a better way to remove endorphin effect. (I am surprised that more
drops didn't show on Triple Warmer)
2. Would asking client to stop his daily medication allow me to read more?
3. Is it safe to ask him to stop medications?
4. Any advice on when to ask him to consider stopping medication /supplements?
5. Should I wait until a certain number of points stop dropping? (This question
comes up with other clients as well.)
6. Which remedies- both Nosodes and Supports should I be trying to dissolve
tumors and where should they measured?

    Answers:
   
    1. There's no need to get rid of all endorphins the first treatment. As
    long as you have drops to work with. The Endorphins will go away if the
    major stress is removed. There are plenty of indications even with the
    Endorphins. When there's detoxification and relaxation of the body after a
    session, the next treatment more will show up.

    2. Possibly, but not necessarily.
   
    3 & 4 I never advise people to stop their medication, but I also never
    treat clients during treatment with chemo-therapy. I just explain why
    chemotherapy (extremely toxic) is working opposite to Biontology. When they
    finish there treatments they can come for biophoton treatment. 
    I do advise stopping supplements though. These could also cause the drops
    on his Stomach Meridian. Supplements often cause Stomach Ulcers, but of
    course so can the chemo.
    If there's an ongoing cause for the ulcers, the drops will not cease. 
   
    5. No, it is all about the symptoms. When the symptoms that the medication
    is used for are gone, medication can be stopped. 
    In case of chemotherapy it is different, since this is cancer causing in
    itself. Most symptoms you mentioned, apart for the initial tumours, are
    most likely caused by the chemo-therapy..
   
    6. You should not concentrate on the tumours themselves, but on their
    causes. With the present information I do not even know what kind of
    tumours there are so I cannot begin to tell you what the causes could be
    and how to treat.
    =>  What are the readings on the Nervous system. The brain cancer should be
    visible there. Try to find out what cancer fits there (Liver Cancer,
    Ovarian Cancer, etc). This will give an indication on the type of cancer
    your client has and on what the underlying cause is.
    => What are the readings on the Cartilage Articular Degeneration meridian
    (Bone Cancer)? 
   
    * It is very likely that the newly developed cancers are a result of the
    treatment.
     
    * In case of Lung Cancer and an unclear reading because of Endorphins I
    would treat Whiplash anyway. Whiplash has a major negative effect on the
    Lungs. 

    * Plumbum is a remedy I found frequently on the Cartilage Articular
    Degeneration meridian in cases of Bone Cancer. 

    * Check on jawbone infection (Kieferostitis)/Granuloma Denti. Drops on
    Stomach Meridian indicate this, but it might also be ulcers.

    * When you measure Appendicitis Necroticans, there's no need to use Chronic
    and Acute Appendicitis in the same session.

    2nd Session

    Conversation:
    I presented the client with the information about not treating while on
    Chemotherapy.
    He is considering stopping.
    Client want to use his life as an experiment to find blend of Western
    medicine and alternative care
    He practices Qigong daily.

    New information:
    Chemo pill => only one very targeted pill for a specific cancer = non-small
    cell adenocarcinoma w EGFR mutation (Epidermal Growth Factor Response) 
    This type of cancer is apparently only seen in Asians

    Family History:
    Father died of lung cancer
    Mother died of Alzheimer's + had breast cancer earlier in life.
    Daughter currently is in fatal stage of breast cancer. Already beyond time
    expected to live
    Obviously, a lot of emotional stress in the household.

    Questions: 
    1. Is there any point treating him with biophoton therapy if he continues
    with the Tarceva? Palliative?
    2. At what point do I treat tumors themselves?
    3. How do I test for bone cancer? Is there a Nosode specific to bone
    cancer?

    November 2013 edited November 2013 Flag
    Comments/Remarks:
    1. Why are no nosodes used in the first treatment >12? 
    I expect similar points to drop when in the hand treatment only 4 Support
    Remedies are used.
    2. I miss a real assessment, or targeted treatment. 

    Answers:
    1. Palliative treatment is always a possibility
    2. You do not need to treat the tumor itself, you need to find and treat
    the causes. The cancer nosode is not going to solve anything by itself.
    A lot of cancer starts when people have been or are under heavy stress,
    which this man seems to be. If his life situation is/has been so hectic,
    you might calm the system down with Gallbladder remedies like Atropinum. 
    3. There is no nosode for bone cancer.

    Explanation:
    Perhaps I made a mistake by not running Plumbum on the >12 years program,
    so I added it to Foot Plates. I felt that this session was more exploratory
    given your previous comment about wanting to know what type of cancer.

    Comments and Questions:
    1. I am a bit confused about the use of Carcinona Bronchialis nosode. What
    does it do? When should it be used?
    2. Given the numerous meridians involved, it is difficult to determine the
    causal organ at this point. I am guessing Large or Small Intestine as I
    feel there may have been some unresolved infection which may have led to
    the cancer.
    3. Following protocol, I will work on Triple Warmer first, then Circulation
    /Veins, then Small Intestine and Large Intestine, correct??
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel

    * Plumbum should not be used in the first treatments at all. The Kidneys
    are still dropping. It is essential that the main excretion systems are up
    and running first. Probably the Kidney problem is caused by Intestinal
    Flora due to Appendicitis.
    Even though Plumbum might be necessary for your client, it should be
    introduced at the right time. The right order of treatment is very
    important.
   
    * You still must still treat with Nosodes. According to protocol, you first
    need to get the Hormonal system and the Kidneys functioning properly again.
    Because the Intestines are dropping too, it is likely an Appendicitis issue
    whereby the Intestinal Flora has disappeared and has gone into the Urinary
    Tract. Then you will need to test the Intestinal Flora on the Kidney
    points. If they match, you need to treat with the Intestinal Bacteria in
    order to get the Kidneys right. Then you need to address the reason why the
    Bacteria have escaped.
    Kidneys are more important to balance than Circulation. 

    * When treating anything it is important that you first find out what the
    problem really is.
    Where a tumour appears has little to do with the causal organ. The type of
    tumour says more.
    A tumor is a SYMPTOM of malfunctioning systems. One first needs to find out
    what kind of tumor it is. 
    => If it is a Cyst, then the problem is the Circulation. 
    => If it is a Fibroid then the cause lies in the Thyroid, etc. 
    You can find out by measuring the different types of tumours on the Lungs
    and on the Organ Degeneration meridian. 
    => If you for example measure Ovarial Cyst on the Lungs, then you know it
    is a Cyst in origin. 
    => If you measure Carcinoma Uteri, then you know the tumour has been caused
    by the Thyroid.

    Answers:
    1. The Carcinoma nosodes only indicate the QUALITY of the tumour. If a
    Carcinoma Nosode matches, then depending on the type of nosode you can
    determine the type of tumour. Once you have determined that, you can start 
    working on the cause. You can also treat with the nosode to change the
    quality of the tumour. You can change it from malignant to benign. So
    Carcinoma Uteri should be changed to Myoma Uteri the next session.

    2. This is not a likely cause. 

    3. You forgot about the Kidneys... number 8 in the measurement protocol.
    They are second after the Hormonal System.
    "When the kidneys are bad this is the first system to look at after the
    hormonal system"

Migraine, Tinnitus, Decreased Sleep

Sylvia
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Symptoms Flag

65 year old male came in seeking help with his migraines. He reported as main
complaint his back, feet, sleeplessness and tinnitus. (He forgot to write down
his migraine)

Client was a CIA agent and soldier in Vietnam and Dessert Storm wars. He was
harmed when bomb blew up near him, almost lost his left hand (multiple scars
after reconstruction of hand) and he has shrapnel all over his body. The
shrapnel occasionally comes out of his skin in small pieces.

The client had a vasectomy about 38 years ago. He is in his second marriage. He
has a high-pressure job in charge of security for all of the State he lives
in.He has been vaccinated against everything, including anthrax and was often
used as an “experiment” by the government when trying out vaccines.

I have given him four treatments so far.


First session: - drops almost everywhere. 

I focused on Spin Inversion, Whiplash and Vaccination remedies. 

Measured: Varicellen, Pertussis, Poliomyelitis, Morbillinum, Coxsackie,
Plumbum, Mercury, Anti-Tetanus. 

Support: Agrimony, Cerebrum, Thalamus, Viscum, Friged Violet and Ozaliet.

He reported tingling in his hands and growling of bowels after treatment. 

Second session: 

Measured: Streptococcus, Veratrum, Mercury, Plumbum, Nickel, Nux Vomica,
Tubercullinum and Atropinum. 

Supports: Discus, Osteoheel, Cerebrum, Thalamus, Viscum, Coxsackies.

Results: On his way home from the treatment he reported that his back pain had
gone away. (It used to hurt every moment of the day) 

Third session: 

Measured: Adenomyose Gallenblase, Atropinum, Gelsenium, Calc. Biliaris, Calculi
Renalies, Spascupreel, Gallium and Sutoxol. 

Support: Agrimony, Rock Rose, Osteoheel.

Reported afterwards that the tinnitus was worse than ever, back hurt after
straining it for a brief perion then pain went away, heel spurs on left foot
still painful.

Fourth session:

Measured: Vaccinium, Luesinum, Lyme’s, Strumeel, Zyzgium, Streptococcus
Heamolyticus, Osteoheel.  

Support: Otitis Media, Gelsenium, Atropinum, Salmonellas.

Immediately after the fourth treatment the client reported relief from heel
spur in foot.


Questions…Is there a need to treat the shrapnel in his body? If he finds a
piece should it be neutralized? What kind of damage can that be causing?

His main complaint is migraines that incapacitate him. They occur about every
2-3 weeks. I asked where the pain was and he reports that they are in clusters
throughout his head.

His decreased sleep does not seem to have a specific time during the night. He
reports that he never sleeps well and is restless all night. I am thinking it
has to do with past traumatic experiences during his time at war.I focused the
treatment on first cleaning out vaccines, heavy metals, food poisoning and then
hollow organs. He needs relief from migraines, tinnitus and needs to sleep
better. 

Any advice?

    He may be EMF sensitive lowering exposure may help BUT since that is not
    Biophoton Therapy that discussion would need to be OFF FORUM I think. 

    For Cell Phone radiation you can use: Montmorronite and Ozaliet. 

    Did you check ALL the metals? Aluminum, Plumbum met, Mercury, Cuprum,
    Platinum? Are there more? Could he be going into Spin-Inversion in his
    bedroom at night? Are Liver and Thyroid balanced? 

    The website EMFsafetynetwork has specifics on which exposures to decrease.

    Biophoton therapy helped my EMF sensitivity greatly BUT after 4 months the
    benefit started declining although I'm still 90% better a year after
    treatment thanks to the Chiren. I do practice "prudent avoidance".

    Hi Toril,

    Considering EMF sensitivity and other influences of the environment is
    definitely a part of Biontology and can of course be discussed here.
    Although if you look at the case above it is not the first thing that we
    have to look at. So please if you have good information about EMF open a
    new discussion to inform us. That would be very interesting. Thank you!

    Hi Sylvia,

    I'll try to get Johan involved and I'll discuss this case with him. 

    What I miss is a focus. The main complaint is migraines and those always
    relate to Gallbladder issues. The emotional trauma of being in the war and
    the physical trauma caused by multiple toxins and vaccinations for sure
    have a great effect on both Liver and Gallbladder. I don't see this
    reflected in your treatments.

    Also can you give more insight in what you measured?

    Did you measure the Spin Inversion the first time? Was it there too the
    2nd, 3rd and 4th time? 

    EMF doesn't cause Spin Inversion directly although it can make your energy/
    aura weaker and enhance your sensitivity to it.

    It seems to me that you don't really have a focus. Can you tell me more
    about where you measured all these remedies?

    No, I had been automatically treating everyone for Spin Inversion and
    Whiplash until I saw you last week and you and Karolina mentioned that it
    was not a good idea because of the missing information.

    He has not been Spin Inverted in the subsequent treatments. 

    It is difficult to tell which points had drops from my notes. I've been
    keeping better records since posting this. He had two more treatments and
    all his issues have cleared. I focused on Gallbladder remedies and that
    worked. 

    Thank you,

    Next Session on Wednesday will finish Vaccines (like Polio) and will try to
    check for more Metals as suggested. 

    Will test Chem Trail chemicals (Aluminium, Barium, Strumeel) Any other
    suggesttions to stop ringing?

    Tinnitis is caused by real Physical Pressure. This can be caused by
    Emotional or Mental Pressure.
    Emotional or Mental Pressure very often makes the Tinnitis Worse.
    Pressure is always Gallbladder related, so are Migraines. But in migraines
    the Stomach and/or Small Intestine are also involved.

    Karen: ALWAYS treat Poliomyelitis in the first session.
    The Pituitary is Critical in the Self Recognition and Healing Process.
    Polio Paralyses this process.
    You are using way too many Remedies and especially too many Nosodes.

Woman (98) with Polio

slevarekslevarek
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client: 98 year old woman. I have been seeing her off and on since last year 

Symptoms: She is incredibly healthy.. Her main complaint at this point.. is her
Polio (contracted at 87 years old), no major symptoms, strength in the left leg
is gone (recently) and now she's unable to walk, wears a support, she is so
frustrated with this since she could walk easily before..

She is not on any pharmaceuticals.. no drugs whatsoever. Her mind is so
clear.. just this Polio issue has us both baffled.. She is asking me why would
this start up now.. and what could I do for it.. 

I am so surprised when I measure her. 

Measurement:
at this point the points that drop are on the Nervous System. 

No drops on Triple Warmer, Large Intestines and Small Intestines (last year the
Intestines did drop)

Any suggestions on what I should be looking for.. or if there is anything I can
do to help her in this area.. ?

    No drops on her Gallbladder nor Kidney/ Bladder. There were drops on just

    10 days earlier she had 3 teeth that had to be pulled.. all went well for

    I used the following:
    Nervous System: Neurofibroma, Neuro Injeel, Aesculus, Placenta, Nervoheel,
    Angio Heel
    Large Intestines (left): Bact Coli, Candida, Bact Lactis 

    And for a nail fungus which she has had for years.. on just one toe.. I
    gavel Nagelmykose, Cutis Comp.

    But I am not sure why the Polio is worsening.. Not sure where this would
    show up.. or how I would look for it on which meridian. Thanks

    I would try Rubella, Variolinum, Botulism or Heavy Metals on the Nervous
    system.

    Rubella is the cause for MS. But might also be useful in Polio.

    Did you treat for vaccinations, or was she never vaccinated?

    Why did you treat Candida? I never use this remedy, since I consider it to
    be a symptom more than a cause.

    This women never had vaccinations.. but she did contract polio later in
    life. 
    She did have some childhood illness. nothing serious. 

    After being on antibiotics after having teeth removed, was off the
    antibiotics for a couple of days, she did have drops on the left hand Large
    Intestine Meridian and the Candida corrected the drops.

    I will try Rubella, Variolinum, Botulism or Heavy Metals on the Nervous
    system next visit as well.

    Usually Candida (the remedy) doesn't solve the Intestinal problem, because
    Candida (the yeast) is just an opportunist in an unhealthy environment of
    Gastro-Intestinal Inflammation and lack of healthy Intestinal Flora.

    It is the terrain that has to be addressed. You might need the Appendicitis
    remedies, Diverticulosis and/or Intestinal Bacteria to get rid of the
    problem. Food Poisonings can also throw of the balance in the gut. 

    See what you measure if you use the right order of measurement given in the
    protocol Johan sent out. You'll find that if you do so Candida is usually
    not needed as a remedy.

    Latest treatment:

    Symptoms: She's not feeling well this day, however her nurse informed me
    all was well physically with her. Blood pressure, heart were all normal and
    good.

    Measurement:
    Triple Warmer (L - upper 2 points)
    Heart meridian (L)

    Whiplash treatment => corrected  point Triple Warmer (L) 

    Triple Warmer (R) - no drops

    Nervous System - Rubella (followed your suggestion and it matched),
    Variolinum, Neurofibroma, Neuralgo Rheum, Botulism.
    Large Intestine, 
    Small Intestines
    Large Intestine - Appendicitis
    Small Intestine - Duodenitis, Duodenheel
    No other drops

    Measurement after session: 
    No more drops 
    I did measure on the skin meridian on the foot and found drops..

    Second short session:
    SM: Cutis Comp, Nagelmykose (she has a fungus really bad on one toe), Green
    Essence,

    Measured again: no drops

    Dyslexia:
    Paw Paw (her nurse is leaving for a week, she is worried about handling
    family guests who will be coming then, feels overwhelmed), Crowea, Calm &
    Clear, Cognis essence, Old Man Banksia

    After every session she does feel more energy.. I see her once every 2
    weeks.

    Our biggest concern is the leg where the Polio has been acting up on her.
    She use to be able to walk easily.. but now its nearly impossible without
    someone helping here. Also she has had just recently some sort of vertigo
    going on.. Makes her feel like she is going throw up, terrible dizzy.
    I felt maybe it had to do with the Whiplash area..

    Did another short session for her for clearing of aura: 
    Electro Essence, Space Clearing Essence, Crab Apple, Ozaliet and Causticum.

    Will see her again in 2 weeks.

    Our goal is to somehow bring relief to the Polio leg.. any suggestions is
    appreciated.

    I think that it is unwise to listen to nurses or doctors about the
    condition of any client. Usually they're not seeing the complete picture. 
    The fact that your client did not feel well and the nurse saying that she
    is well means that the nurse does not listen to her client.

    With using so many Bach and Bush remedies, you will  never get your client
    well. You only mask the issues and do not address any problems.

    Please follow protocol.

Question (asked this before!)

I have wondered about that there is no info warning in the Chikey about
treating people with transplants or people with plastic vessels. Should
there not bee such a warning?

I would love to sell it but I am worried about the use without warning!

    Hello Peter,

    The following  information is on the www.chikey.org website under about the
    Chikey.

    Need to know

    Users may feel tired for a day after a session.
    We recommend that Chikey® users drink at least one half gallon or two
    liters of water daily for the first three days after a session.
    Recipients of an organ transplant or an artificial tube, vein or pig valve
    are advised not to use the Chikey®.
    It can be used as per instructions in individuals with pacemakers, stents,
    tooth implants, artificial hips, metal plates or rods or breast implants.
    Individuals who have had a vasectomy or who use proton pump inhibitors or
    H2-receptor antagonists are known to have no or minimal results.
    Individuals who use steroids have shown delayed results.

    The User Guide included with the Chikey does not address the above
    condition.  Biontologist are advised to review with their clients or
    potential Chikey customers.

    Currently we offer a Quick User Guide to assist with assembly and general
    use of the Chikey. A copy is distributed with every Chikey sent out of
    IABS.  In addition we have available a Chikey brouchure which includes
    the proper disclosures.

    Please contact me directly for PDF versions of the Brochure and Quick User
    Guide at:

    dpahler@iabs-us.com

    Great question thank you for sharing.

Past use of Psychoactive Drugs (several times)

katherine
January 2013 edited January 2014 in Medication Flag
28 year old woman whom I've seen twice came to see me with the following
symptoms:
joint pain, ligament pain, fatigue, sleeping 10 hours with much difficulty to
wake up, headaches begin at base of neck then pain and pressure over whole
skull ,candida, long term constipation. She also picks at her face.  Was hit
over the head 3 years ago in violent attack.  Lots of emotional trauma.

Doctors diagnosis: Borrelia and Babesia.  She has done 2 rounds of antibiotics
that have not helped.
Diagnoses she got in the past: H. Pylori, Mononucleosis, HPV.   
Medication: Has been on 2 or 3 different anti depressants in the past , Paxil
was one of them does not know the others.   

First visit:
Treated scar from head trauma. 

Hormonal System meridian - all points screaming and I was unable to calm them
down with Atropinum, Viscum, Plumbum.  After Whiplash still screaming but a bit
different quality sound. Asked if she uses pot,  yes very occassionally. Ran
Viscum and Pot and now Pituitary gland and Parathyroid gland points dropped ,
Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus balanced.  
Large Intestines, Lungs, Small Intestines, Gallbladder - all had several drops
that were balanced with 3 Appendix' and 2 Tonsillitis'.  

Said she was easily willing not to smoke until next visit. 
Next day she had sore neck.  

Second visit:
4 days later she came back with same situation with Hormonal System and drops
on Appendix and other points on left and right sides of Large Intestines, Small
Intestines, and Gallbladder. 
Then she asked me if it would matter that in the past she has used XTC many
times, also peyote, mushrooms, LSD, cocaine...  
We talked  about what these drugs do to the Pituitary and how they might effect
one's Self development as a free being...  She wants to continue to be treated
and I told her I would seek consultation about her situation and would get back
to her.  She was and is grateful for the insights and help and of course I am
too!  What advice for how to proceed...Thank you.

    Hi Katherine,

    Drugs can stay in the body for a long time and they cause a lot of damage
    in the organs. XTC alone is known to cause kidney, liver and brain damage.
    Drug abuse (XTC, Cocaine) also causes dehydration that leads to sometimes
    severe constipation. Often a lot of hard and poisonous fecal matter is
    stuck in the intestinal tract of (ex-) drug abusers.

    This is consistent with her complaints: joint pain (kidney), ligament pain
    (liver), fatigue (liver), constipation (dehydration)

    The head pressure that starts in the neck is possibly caused by the
    Whiplash or maybe it is an inflammation of the meninges (did this point
    drop on the Nervous System meridian?).

    Of course after the drug abuse and anti-biotics there is no healthy gut
    flora anymore, which explains the candida. It is no surprise that
    Appendicitis Necroticans is an issue... 

    The only thing that you can do is what we always do: measuring what the
    body needs with a main focus on the organs that cause the most problems. So
    in this case the Liver (and of course the Gallbladder), Kidneys and
    Intestines. But only treat the Liver when it is the right time (when
    elimination channels are healthy again).

    When the body starts to eliminate the drugs, sometimes clients get the same
    symptoms as when they used the drugs (e.g. hallucinations). So make sure
    you warn her upfront.

    Thank you for these helpful insights and suggestions.  I received a message
    this week from this client that after visiting the doctor(the visit was to
    go over test results which showed that she still has borrelia and babesia)
    he has convinced her to try antibiotics a 3rd time.   She said she would
    contact me after this round of the antibiotics.  I will let you know if she
    comes again how things proceed.   Katherine

    Im seeing him later today for a session, so I will give lots of support to

    stress the importance of that too.

    Headache:
    Where in his head is the headache? The location is indicative of the organ
    that is responsible for the headaches. 
    Could be bladder, gallbladder or stomach. 
    I have also seen people with severe headaches caused by jawbone infections,

    Rash:
    Rash in his armpits could be neurodermitis, which is called by Gallbladder.

    Nose bleeds:
    How high is his bloodpressure, this could be causing his nosebleeds.
    It could also be caused by irritation of his mucous membranes, which again
    can be caused by food poisoning or strep or staph infection.

    HIV:
    HIV positive could be caused by many things, Is he gay?

    Headache was in the back of his head 
    His rash is pretty aggressive... especially in his right armpit.

    Measurement:
    No drops, although he had tons of drops the last session.   
   
    Question:
    Im assuming he's masking?  I just ran supports in the first treatment
    thinking he might show drops after that but he was still all green.  
    So unsure what to do, i just ran more supports on the feet thoughts?

    I also assume he is full of Endorphins.

    I would advise just to run Plumbum, Viscum, plus remedies for Kidneys and
    Lymphatics in order to drain his system from Toxins. There must be many and
    his Kidneys do not seem to working properly.

    Are there also no drops on his Skin meridian?

    This client appears to have many issues. It is hard to give an advice with
    this limited information. But since this is an anonymous question more
    insight will probably not be given...
   
    Answers:
    Orthostatic hypotension is an Adrenal problem.

    Bloating is always caused by Gallbladder issues. Headaches can be caused by
    the Gallbladder too. 
    (there might be Billiary Cirrhosis, Cholecystitis, Duodenitis)

    Fatigue normally is caused by one of four things: Spin Inversion, Adrenals,
    Liver or Intestinal Flora. 

    The gluten intolerance is generally caused by an Intestinal issue.
   
    What kind of Appendicitis was it?
    After the Appendicitis has been cleared, there is most of the time
    necessity for Diverticulose and the Intestinal Bacteria.

    1. See above suggestions for direction, but things have to be treated in
    the right sequence. (protocol)

    COMMENT
    I did not want to overtreat this client because of the 'autoimmune"
    connection. I limited the # of nosodes, especially if she was not feeling
    well.

    Questions:
    1. Is it ok to treat if not on anticoagulants? There are differing medical
    opinions whether her eye problem and MRI finding of venous defect were due
    to clots. Newest opinion is that the venous defect is congenital and not
    due to injury/clot. Eye problem still questionable

    2. Should Mast Cell Activation be targeted? With what remedies? Should
    parasites be a focus of remedies?

    3. On what organ system should I concentrate? What to put on cards for
    Chikey?

    4. What have I missed, given many organ meridians continue to drop and
    symptoms remain.

    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel

    Answers:

    1. Yes. Just treat the Gallbladder system. It has a big influence on the
    thrombocytes

    2. Parasites and Mast Cell Activation are not matters to focus on in
    Biontology

    3.  I would not start putting anything on the cards for the Chikey until a
    proper diagnosis could be made.
    There are too many mysteries so far. 

    4. Focus should be on the following organs:
    Stomach  => Kieferostitis, Granuloma Denti (Jaw and Teeth problems show up
    on the Stomach meridian)
    The eye problem could be caused by this or by the Gallbladder system. 
   
    Bladder => Intestinal Flora. I suspect that this is the cause of the
    infection in the Urinary Tract. There will probably be only one nosode
    matching but put them all four in.

    Gallbladder =>  all Gallbladder nosodes => The Gallbladder can be very
    disruptive in Thrombocyte production, it also has a Causal effect in
    Irregular and Rapid Heartbeat. 
    I suspect the Gallbladder disruption goes a lot further than Gallstones…


    Additional Comment: 

    You measure Duodenal issues on the Stomach meridian... This is certainly
    possible but then you should also find them on the Small Intestine

Dog - Skin Issues

Chrystyne
October 2014 edited October 2014 in Animals Flag
Dog:
"BUDDY" is a mix of Rottweiler, Labrador and Pit Bull.

Symptoms:
Pink, itchy skin patches => especially on joints and front paws => started 3
month ago
Scratching and biting himself

Diet:
I have changed his dog food diet to my diet. He mostly eats vegetables, lamb
and free range chicken, only 3 days now.

Vet's diagnosis:
He suspects that we are dealing with an environmental issue because Buddy is
not the only dog who is suffering right now.

Medication prescribed by vet:
Anahyst, Steroid, Antibiotic => nothing helped
The law requires vaccinations (you need to have a certificate on hand all
times), so I am going to give him these.

Questions:
1. Where do I measure him?
2. What do I need to treat him with, do we even have any vaccine nosodes for
dogs in the Chiren?
3. Do I use the foot plates or hand rods?
4. Is it likely that his symptoms are caused by environmental factors like the
vet suggests, or are we dealing with vaccinations?

Any Suggestions would be great fully appreciated.

    Problems of the Skin and Joints => this combination indicates a Kidney
    problem.

    Dogs move low to the ground, and pick up far more toxins than we do. If,
    for any reason, their Kidneys cannot handle them, the body needs to excrete
    through the Skin which can cause itching.

    Answers:
    1. Some practitioners assess dogs by surrogate measuring on themselves.
    Normally this is not necessary and you can just treat by symptoms. Animals
    -and children- usually react extremely well to treatment. 

    4. Although it might be an environmental issue, I do not think you should
    solve it this way.
   
    2. You first need to treat with all Kidney remedies. 
    Treat the water the dog drinks with the 2-7 years program (no remedies) to
    increase the detoxifying properties. 
    Then after 4/5 days I suggest you treat with Heavy Metals and (again)
    Kidney support. Heavy Metals are likely to be the cause, but it can also be
    Botulism (or other food poisonings).
    This should solve the problem. 
    In the end you can try Skin remedies

    3. The treatment you should use for animals is the 2-7 years program. It
    does not matter if you connect the foot plates or the hand rods.

October 2015 - Intestinal Flora

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
October 2015 in Q&A Flag
Question
We have 5 Intestinal Flora remedies, but I keep reading that Bifidobacterium
lactis, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium longum are very very
important to intestinal health. Is there a reason it has been omitted from our
list of remedies. Do you suggest we make our own remedy?

Answer
A correction is needed. We have only 4 bacterial nosodes that can contribute to
restoring the Intestinal Flora. These remedies have both low and high
potencies, which makes that they can both stimulate bacterial growth inside the
intestines where they belong, and help the body get rid of the same bacteria in
organs where they don’t belong.

The only nosodes that are composed with both high and low potencies are
Bacterium Coli, Bacterium Lactis, Bacterium Proteus and Bacterium Pyo.
Klebsiella Pneumoniae is also a bacterium that may reside in the Large
Intestine as part of the normal Flora, and it does not cause harm as long as it
does not leave the intestines, however, this bacterium is not helpful in
rebuilding healthy flora, and thus the nosode Klebsiella Pneumoniae has no low
potency in it. Klebsiella Pneumoniae is only used in case of infections outside
of the intestinal tract.

Homeopathy works completely different than supplementation, and even though we
don’t have all of the hundreds of microbes that the healthy flora consists of
available in informational remedies, the 4 bacteria that we do have are
sufficient in correcting the symbiotic harmony of all species in the
intestines. This is shown by the disappearance of drops and the restoration of
healthy function, which I have observed countless of times without ever needing
more remedies.

So no, I would not suggest making own remedies of the bacteria you mention. It
is not needed, will distract, and the created remedy also will most likely not
be of the same quality that the available nosodes are.

    Maybe the question may be posed: What is the difference between
    Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium longum
    and the Bacterium Coli, Bacterium Lactis, Bacterium Proteus and Bacterium
    Pyo. and why do we use only the second group ?

    "Homeopathy works completely different than supplementation"

    "the 4 bacteria that we do have are sufficient in correcting the symbiotic
    harmony of all species in the intestines. This is shown by the

EMF Sensitivity - APC battery backup

Satya OrionSatya Orion
January 2015 edited January 2015 in Q&A Flag
I am extremely sensitive to EMF and have found that when using the recommended
APC battery backup with the Chiren, that I develop heart palpitations and
increased tinnitus. (the APC has a strong magnetic field).

I am treating myself for underlying issues of this sensitivity, but wonder what
to do in the meantime, without causing harm to myself or the Chiren.

    I am also electrical sensitive. You can try wearing shielding clothing
    while using the battery pack. These can be purchased at lessemf.com. Or,
    you should just plug into a power strip and take a chance, perhaps. I have
    been meaning to purchase the strip and would like to know if you have
    actually measured the magnetic radiation using a meter? I know battery
    packs, in general, do have high magnetic fields around them.

    Yes, I have measured with a gauss meter.  Actually the shielding clothing
    only protects from RF, not magnetic fields.  I find that using a surge
    protector alone does help.  I find that I also react to the LED
    backlighting of the Chiren screen unfortunataly.  I don't think anything
    can be done about that.

    I believe sheepskin protects from EMF. Maybe try wrapping the battery in
    sheepskin. I am not sure how the battery looks like and where it is
    attached since I dont have one. But try. It might help. Sheepskintown.com
    has very good prices.

    I am sorry to have deleted the previous comment, but Johan has found
    Orgonite and Shungite, when close to the body, to be very disruptive to the
    body's energy field. So using it is counterproductive to self-regulation. 

    Satya: I think there are no solutions that will 100% protect from every
    form of radiation. If you are even sensitive to the Chiren's backlight this
    is quite a severe form of sensitivity. 
    You will need to be very careful with anything that may influence the
    aura. 
    Do you by any chance already wear or use energetic objects? Or are there
    other things you do that may influence the energy system of the body, like
    energetic healing? 
    I have encountered several energetic healers who really needed to stop
    their work for some time to ground and heal themselves… Energy workers can
    often become extremely EMF sensitive as some ways of "tuning in" opens up
    the aura for outside influences and thus can cause weaknesses if it is not
    done and restored consciously. The body and aura need time and rest to
    restore…

    Thank you Karolina for your help.  I have stopped using crystals and
    shungite also as I found they didn't help. 
    Yes, I no longer practice Reiki as I saw that I was taking on too much of
    others' energy. I do find that giving myself Reiki helps quite a lot,
    though.   I think that years of meditation practice and living with
    awakened masters has also opened my aura up too much. This followed by 2
    very intense and stressful years, moving 4 times - always with new paint &
    carpet, smart meters, air travel.   It's no wonder that my body and aura
    are depleted.  I know that you are right - what I need is time to rest and
    restore.  thank you! 

    I have had one session with an Osteopath who practices very gentle cranio
    sacral therapy as a help for some structural issues.  I found this one
    session helpful, but know that Johan recommends no other therapies during
    Chiren healing.  Probably it would be best to discontinue this as well.

    That sure is a cocktail of life- and environmental circumstances that does
    the trick to make you overly sensitive. 

    Structural manipulations are not necessarily incompatible with Biontology,
    but it all depends on how your Osteopath or Cranio Sacral therapist works.
    It becomes a problem when these therapists also manipulate energetically
    (which they sometimes do without even asking!) or when they "crack" the
    spine or other bones (which is not common practice in either of these
    therapies, but sometimes it is done anyway).

    You will just have to find out for yourself how it feels and combines.
    Experimenting on yourself is the best way to learn ;-)
    But the main thing is rest. Meditation may elevate you in a spiritual
    sense, but certain practices can be very depleting to the body. If you for
    example have had many kundalini experiences in meditation this can cause
    Adrenal fatigue and also other physical problems.

    Working on boundary awareness is also advisable since there is usually not
    enough attention for this in spiritual practice. Having strong boundaries
    translates in having a strong aura. The aura is the body's energetic filter
    and defence system.

    I have never measured this device so I don't know how strong its field is.

    However, if you get palpitations, this means you have a Gallbladder
    problem. Increased Tinnitus is also related to the Gallbladder. So you
    should address this in treatment.

    The magnetic field is quite strong close to the screen where I am of course
    touching constantly.

    Yes, the Gallbladder is my focus now and I know this is the basis of most
    of this issue.  Thank you so much Karolina and Johan.  The things you have
    said helped me a lot

    Johan, many of my clients have similar Gallbladder issues and I am never
    sure how soon to address this in treatment, where the Gallbladder is so far
    down the protocol.  When I am still focusing on clearing the
    elimination pathways should I also be addressing the Gallbladder in some
    way?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    February 2015 Flag
    The Gallbladder is a YANG (eliminatory) organ  and is not that far down in
    the protocol. The Stomach meridian ONLY comes first when the imbalance is
    caused by dental/jaw issues. If not then you first treat the Gallbladder.

    Usually you treat about 3 layers at a time. When the Hormone System and
    Kidneys are corrected you can already start to treat the Gallbladder. 

    Hormone System and Kidneys don't take that long to be corrected unless
    there are Kidney stones, which take longer. But if Kidney stones are the
    only problem that continues to show up I don't wait for this to disappear
    before continuing with other layers. This is because stones don't affect
    the eliminatory Kidney function that much.
   
    However if there is severe calcification in the arteries (sometimes people
    come in with a diagnosis of 90% calcified arteries) you will have to wait
    with treating the Gallbladder (and also the Adrenals) since this may raise
    blood pressure too much. 
    You always need to be aware of what you are doing when choosing your focus.
    Sometimes I just treat just 2 meridians.

Breast Cancer in Both Breasts

m3pollack
May 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
A woman newly diagnosed with breast cancer in both breasts came to see me this
afternoon. She does not want surgery, chemo or radiation. 

Measurement:
Many points dropping => was only able to address some of them 
Large Intestine (R) + Lymphatic System (R) - many drops => Appendicitis,
Appendicitis Necroticans, Tonsillitis 
Breast Point dropped => Cacinoma Mammae balanced it 
Other remedies used: (Carsinosinum - own remedy), Discus, Podophylum, Viscum,
(Deer Antler - own remedy), Glyoxal 

Questions:
1) Should we wait the requisite 4 to 5 days to re-measure and treat given the
severity of her condition?  What interval would be appropriate?

2) Any other remedies you would recommend?

3) She feels this began 6 years ago when she was exposed to some highly toxic
fumes in a printing factory.  What might I do to address this?

4) How might I use the Chikey to further support her?

Many thanks for your responses!

    Firstly I miss the remedies for the Triple Warmer System (the Vaccinations
    etc..) This must ALWAYS be the first to address.

    Next time you should try to find out what kind of Tumor it is, is it a Cyst
    or a Fibroid? 

    The woman must have other Symptoms, what are the Symptoms? 

    Why does she think it all started 6 years ago? I need more information to
    answer your questions.

    Question: 
    How does one determine whether the Tumor is a Cyst or Fibroid? 
    If Circulation, Gallbladder or Liver resonate, it's Cyst. 
    If Fibroid, then Thyroid remedies resonate? 
    Is there any other way? When does one utilize the Cancer Remedies? After
    trying the Circulation, Gallbladder, Liver or Thyroid remedies first?

    Where does one measure the Breast Point?
  •

    May 2013 edited May 2013 Flag
    Myriam:
    Only if the Liver takes part in the Cancer, Toxins are Causal. So in this
    case you should be able to measure Carcinoma Hepatis on the Breast Point.
    This is most likely not the case.

    Madelyn:
    For Identification:
    Breast Cysts => Mamma Cystica matches on the Hormonal Breast Point (or
    Degeneration Meridian)
    Breast Firbroids => Myom Uteri matches on the Hormonal Breast Point (or
    Degeneration Meridian)

    For Treatment:
    Cyst => Treat Circulation (Gallbladder/Liver might be Causal or other
    Circulatory problems)
    Fibroid => Treat Thyroid

    Jennifer:
    You can always find Breast Cancer on the Organ Degeneration Meridian too,
    but I'll try to explain....
    Breast Point => On the Triple Warmer Meridian, follow the hand-bone that
    lies proximal from the Pituitary or Pineal until you hit the joint (head of
    the bone).

    Hi Karolina,  thanks so much for this information.

    When you say to treat Circulation (Gallbladder/Liver), if the Breast Cancer
    is Cystic, and the Thyroid, if it is a Fibroid, do you do that even if
    those points are not dropping?  

    Now that I'm home, I can access this woman's file and share more specific
    info about the first treatment.  
    Heart (L-1 + R-1)
    Triple Warmer (Breast & Parathyroid)
    Veins (L-1+R-1)
    Circulation (L-1+R-1)
    Nervous System (L-1)
    Large Intestines (L-1 + R-3)
    Small Intestines (R-2)
    Breast (R-1)
    Lung (R-1)
    Lymphatic System (R-1)

    Bladder (L-1)
    Gallbladder (L-1 + R-1)
    Skin (L-1 + R-1)
    Joints (L-1 + R-1)
    Stomach (L-1)
    Connective tissue (R-1)

    Treatment:
    Whiplash

    >12 Year Program:
    Poliomyelitis, Pertussis, Carcinoma Mammae, Streptococcus Haemolyticus,
    Cholesterinum, Aluminium, Podophyllum, Discus

    Footplates:
    Appendicitis Necroticans, Appendicitis,Tonsillitis, Cystopylonephritis, 
    Carsinosinum, Glyoxal, Viscum, Trichomonadem

    Questions:
    1. I'm sure now that I over used the Nosodes, correct?  
    2. What do you do when there are so many points down and the Hand Treatment
    is not sufficient?  Does that mean I didn't get to the underlying cause?
     How do I know how to do that?
    3. Also, what do you challenge the fatty tissue points with?
    4. I don't know whether her cancers are fibroids or cysts. Do I ask her?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    May 2013 edited May 2013 Flag
    First I'd like to know why you've ran a Whiplash Treatment while the
    Thyroid was not dropping? There was no indication for this... Or did the
    Thyroid point drop and you forget to write it down?

    Also it is tempting to use Carcinoma Mammae, when someone comes in with
    this diagnoses. But when you would follow the protocol this Remedy usually
    won't show up in the first Session. You'll have to balance the basic
    condition first before you start to treat more specifically... and then
    sometimes a Remedy like this is not even needed anymore. Because when, for
    example, Circulation improves the Cyst (if this is what the tumor is) will
    dissolve by itself....

    Then to answer your questions:

    1. Yes that is correct.... far to many Nosodes and too little Support....
    but you've noticed that yourself ;-)

    2. It can be challenging to get all points corrected in the first Session,
    especially when you're not that experienced yet. This is because there are
    always also the Vaccinations in the way. 

    Because of this you'll have to focus on the most important Organs and
    Remedies first. In the first treatment in everyone (there might be
    exception, but this is extremely rare) who has been vaccinated
    Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus will show up. The Para-Thyroid did drop, the
    Thyroid didn't so there was no Whiplash causing this drop... and probably
    you overlooked the need for Anti-Tetanus....

    The Nervous System is not one of the Organ Systems you want to correct
    first and neither are the Heart/Lungs, Organ Degeneration or Bones since
    they are all not Yang-Organs. 
    And then when you are still trying to correct drops, you want to do this
    with Nosoded and not with Support like Podophyllum. So how did you find the
    remedies "Aluminium, Streptococcus Haemolyticus, Carcinoma Mammae, Discus, 
    Cholesterinum, Podophyllum " to be the first Remedies you wanted to treat
    with?

    Then with so many drops especially on the Large Intestines on the right
    hand, Appendicitis Necroticans is usually a Remedy that corrects a lot of
    points. If you would have used this in the measurement before the Hand
    Treatment, you most likely wouldn't have needed that many Nosodes in the
    Footplate Treatment....

    It is not necessary to correct all points in the first Session, but you
    should follow the right order and balance at least the Hormonal System,
    Kidneys, Circulation and then the Yang Organs...

    3. Fatty Tissue always drops the first couple of Sessions, because this is
    where the body stores Toxins. After a couple of Sessions it usually clears
    up by itself, so it is not something you would focus on unless there's a
    specific reason.
    So what you can measure here is Toxins mostly...

    4. She wouldn't know either if it is a Fibroid or Cyst. That's something
    you have to determine by measuring in the way I've described above:

    "For Identification:
    Breast Cysts => Mamma Cystica matches on the Hormonal Breast Point (or
    Degeneration Meridian)
    Breast Firbroids => Myom Uteri matches on the Hormonal Breast Point (or
    Degeneration Meridian)"

    Thanks Karolina for that definition about Cysts and Fibriods. I have copied
    it and will attach it to the Manual. This is the kind of information
    beginner Biontologists need.

    One question:
    When the points drop for Spin Inversion and/or Whiplash and you treat it
    and then the points don't drop when you measure again should you still put
    in the Nosodes for those particular points??? 

    When the points don't drop after I treat for Spin/Whiplash I just don't put
    in remedies for these points. But by reading your and Johan's comments on
    many cases I now think I should put in the remedy. Am I right or wrong on
    this thought?

    The Appendix pack and Toxins had a lot of focus in my training... and now
    I'm a bit confused about it.

    I have been responding to the standard for Large Intestines, Small
    Intestines, Lymphatic System and Stomach. This created temporary progress,
    it went up and down fast. And now seems to me that it is caused by Dioxin.

    Question:
    Why should she not do a detox on toxins first?
    Is there any advice about whether and when we should start to think about
    Toxins?

    It is so important that the body can excrete toxins, when you start to
    detox! Therefore Kidney, Bladder, Circulation, Gallbladder and Intestines
    have to function optimally first.

    I made the mistake once to start a little bit to early with the Liver
    nosodes, which stopped the progress and made the client fall back. :-(
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    May 2013 Flag
    Janet:
    The Cause, which was the Spin Inversion or Whiplash, was already
    addressed... so there's no need to use a Nosode when a point does not drop
    anymore after treatment.
    I don't know in which comment you have read this? 

    It might be in that we often say that Poliomyelitis always affects the
    Pituitary and should always be treated in the first Session, but this is
    because this point always drops (unless there was no vaccination)! 
    When after the Spin Inversion treatment the steep/energetic drops are
    corrected, there will be slower/physical drops left on the Pituitary and
    Para-Thyroid and these needs to be corrected still. 
    I think that many students, when they start out, are having difficulty with
    the slower (less clear drops), while the steep drops are very easy to
    measure......

    Cecilie:
    Appendicitis is definitely a very big Cause of many problems, that often
    needs several treatments. This hasn't changed in the teachings.... What you
    mean by "the standard for..." I don't know. I have never heard of that. Or
    do you mean to put all Appendicitises and Tonsillitises in at the same
    time...? Please explain what you mean by it.

    To answer you question about Toxins: 
    Toxins will always be excreted by a healthy body. When you restore the
    body's capability to take care of itself, by following the right order of
    treatment -Eliminatory Organs first- it will start to detoxify even without
    addressing to Toxins specifically. 
    When Toxins are Causal however and the body has a hard time eliminating
    them by itself, you can use the specific remedies. But this will show up in
    your measurement by Organs not reacting on the Nosodes, which always should
    be measured first (you'll find the right order of measurement in the
    protocol).

    The Fatty Tissue and Tissue Meridians are not Meridians you should focus on
    in the first treatments, since when detoxification works fine they will
    usually balance out by themselves. 

    Margit:
    Thanks for sharing, since this can't be emphasized enough... 
    Be careful not to treat with Liver Nosodes to early on in the treatment,
    and even when you've treated 4 times.... when the Liver doesn't show
    itself, it is not ready yet!

    In my case, it was the 6th treatment and the liver did show up. But I
    should have tried all the Gallbladder nosodes, before I tried a Liver
    nosode. I have been treated the Gallbladder a lot, but my client took a lot
    of medication, so the 6 treatments were maybe equal to 3 treatments,
    although he has reduced his medication to the half. :-(

    OK.... so in this case it was a matter of measuring/treating in the wrong
    order.... 
    The Yang Organs should be OK first before treating the YIN Organs for a
    good reason. When the Gallbladder (excretion channel for the Liver) is not
    healthy, the Liver will have problems with dumping the Toxins.... which it
    automatically tries to do when treated.

    Yes that can happen, but when you find this in the first couple of
    treatments you still should not use these Liver Nosodes and try to find a
    way around it. This might need a combination of Gallbladder Nosodes,
    Supports.... or just balancing out other meridians to go back to the
    Gallbladder and then find it balanced... but Liver Nosodes in the first
    treatments is never a good idea... 

    When I didn't know, I have made this mistake often without too much of an
    adverse effect, but I wished I would have known for my clients that did
    suffer... :\">
   
    For diagnostic purposes though, it is interesting to find that a Liver
    Nosode corrects many drops, because then you know more about the underlying
    cause.... (make a note of it for future treatment of the client). The Liver
    is a major player in almost any disease...

    On the Organ Degeneration Meridian a Breast Point is unknown... you can
    work on this meridian for cancerous conditions in general. When you find
    Carcinoma Mammae on this meridian this can be an indication of breast
    cancer... but you should never regard this as a solid diagnosis (we can't

    When there's no indication of Cancer on the Organ Degeneration Meridian
    besides measuring it somewhere else, it is less likely that there's actual
    Cancer. However I have to emphasise again that true diagnosis (confirming
    Cancer or excluding it) is impossible with the Chiren.

    Finding Carcinoma Uteri on the Hormonal Gland shows that this remedy has
    Information that will allow the Uterus to balance itself again, no more no
    less... What is actually going on in the body might just be an Inflammation
    or Hormonal troubles relating to the Uterus. These are both symptoms in
    Uterus Cancer... so they can resonate with the remedy Carcinoma Uteri.

    But if there was a Hysterectomy scheduled something was already found by
    the doctors...?

Organ Clock

CecilieCecilie
May 2013 edited January 2014 in Biontology Insights Flag
Is the Organ Clock still used? I don't see it on the Forum, although I do find
it very helpful in the assessment.

When there are a lot of drops I concentrate on the Organ that most noticeably
shows up in the Organ Clock because of Symptoms during a certain time... Am I
doing this right?

    It's a part of the protocol, so of course we pay attention to the Organ
    Clock!

    The thinking goes this way:

    1. Anatomy and physiology of the organs
    2. Energetic component of the organ systems
    3. Emotions
    4. Location of the photon highways
    5. The measurement points on the fingers and toes
    6. Chakras (the gates to the outside)
    7. Five Element theory
    8. Organ clock
    9. Homeopathy – remedies
    10.The measuring results with Chiren®
    11.The muscles and teeth
    12.External disturbances caused by, among others, radiation sources
    (environment) (taken in account with Electrostress workshop)
    It is no sinecure to continuously take into account all these matters when
    treating

    When you ask to symptoms you always see where and when  regarding 7. & 8.

    Peter: 
    Do we have the same protocol? This is not in my protocol. But it is in my
    book. 
   
    For me these are the letters, the Ingredients and I'm wondering how
    everyone puts all these together to "bake the Cake". 
    I was wondering why no one mentions the Organ Clock in reference to
    Symptoms.

    The whole protocol of working with Biontology is more than the Measurement
     Protocol alone, which you are probably referring to in your response to
    Peter...

    Peter is right in that all these elements are part of the Biontology
    Assessment, and you are right in the way you describe it, they are "the
    Ingredients to bake the Cake". ;-)

    Which Ingredients you use all depends on the individual case. Sometimes the
    Organ Clock is very apparent and sometimes other correlations are more
    useful. It is all a matter of having the right knowledge and then using it
    when you can.

    I think on the forum there are some references to it, especially when the
    symptom of Sleeping Problems comes up. But I know for sure that most
    Practitioners use it, since it has been taught.

Plate in Skull

m3pollack
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Contraindications Flag
A friend has asked me to work on her for gallbladder problems (stones).  She is
about 60 years.  When she was 17, she had a terrible accident involving severe
head trauma.  A plate was put in to take the place of the top right side of her
skull, which has been there now for over 40 years.  The accident caused her to
become epileptic.  She does not know what the brain plate is made of and has no
one to ask about it.  Questions:

1. Would the Chiren work stimulate a rejection of this sizable plate?
2. Would it precipitate more seizures?
3. Might it offer some healing to her brain, aside from the gall stone issue?

Many thanks for your thoughts on this. ~Miriam

    Hi Miriam.

    The plate should be fine. There is no worry that the body will reject the
    plate. She should be well secured.
    I have treated some poeple with plate in there head with no problems.

    On the other hand, the plate can couse Spin Inversion. Should look for that
    carefully before you start.
    (scar treatment on the head where the plate is and there is possible a
    Whiplases but you can mesure that)

    while you are mesuring she could feel that she is going in to Seizure,
    Johan has some exsperiance in that and if I recall he did a
    whiplastreatment when that was happening and it stopped. Maybe he can
    answear that better then I.

    The Gall stones can be hard to get out, the treatment it self can´t brake
    the stones down but sure can help the body to discard them. This all
    depends on the state of the GB stones.
    She can help the GB.stones with Castro Oil patch over the GB area. Let it
    be there for a while.

    The treatment can possible help with the brain injury, I am not sure but if
    you think how the treatments works, it could work. If you get a good
    reading, clean the body and by that make him stronger, he could do wonders
    of healing him self. The body dosent want to be in a bad shape and if he is
    clean with no distubesance he will definatly try to fix that is broken.
    Depends on how bad it is.

    Start with the protacal and go from there, that is allways the best way to
    start.

    regards

    HI Halli,

    Thank you for your response.  By "castro oil patch", do you mean castor oil
    and do you mean a physical patch that has castor oil actually on it, or an
    energetic version?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    February 2013 edited February 2013 Flag
    Hi Miriam,

    When Gallstones are not that big the body still can expel or dissolve them
    by itself, but sometimes they're so manifest and big that it is hard for
    the body to do something with it. It then has become a problem that is more
    structural then functional. Giving the amount of treatments needed to
    dissolve those stones wouldn't make any sense to me. We always try to help
    people to stand on their own two feet as soon as possible....

    So in the case of major calcified gallstones, some extra physical help
    might be needed: 

    Some practitioners like to advise a liver flush, which is very hard on the
    body but sometimes has a good effect. (Don't get fooled though by the green
    goblets coming out. A real stone will have a more stone-like appearance and
    will sink in the toilet, the false stones are created as a side effect of
    this cleansing method.) 

    Like Halli I like the more gentle effect of the Castor Oil pack, which also
    assists the body to get rid of Gallstones. At the same time this pack works
    anti-inflammatory as a bonus. 
    The effect of the oil in combination with heat can't be transferred with
    the Chiren so we can't make an "energetic version" of this.

    Don't use herbs though. They are often very intense and disturb the body
    and the treatments.

    1. How many times should one treat Gallstones, until one descide that the
    body can't break down the stones by it self? 
    Johan said that it takes time and that he had not recomended the Liver
    cleanse himself. So I am a bit confused. 
    2. Is there a possibility to post a link about the other option: castor oil
    pack as mention above, if any body needs it. Or can you just google it?

    Would love some clarification on this, thank you.

    Stones are best treated with Calculi Billiaris together with Calculi
    Renales, and Reneel.
    Always use both remedies(both Calculi), it works better.

    You never know how many treatments it takes since we do not know how big or
    how many stones there are.
    I do not recommend the Liver cleanse treatments, like the Hulda Clark
    system, because it leads to discharge of little fat balls and not to
    discharge of stones. The fat balls mainly consist of the olive oil that the
    people have just taken. 
    The Gall Stones do not necesarily dissolve/break down, they can also be
    excreted in the stools.
    Just treat the Liver when it shows itself. The Liver detoxes anyway, but
    does this in its own time schedule.

Collapse

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
January 5 edited January 5 in H.A.A. Messages Flag
KAROLINA COLLAPSED

A rather bad Christmas has come upon us as Karolina collapsed over Chirstmas.
The work has finally taken her down.

This was something that I had expected to come sooner rather than later and I
had warned her for this a number of times. Karolina has been working
incessantly from getting up in the morning until going to bed late at night, 7
days a week, 365 days per year for more than three years. But there were always
things that needed to be done. The high standards for providing service, and
her continuous availability to everyone have taken their toll.

I could not get her to stop and take a break, because there was always the
forum and Q&A’s and now the case studies that required her attention on top of
everything else she did for Health Angel and biontology that is not visible to
you. After I reviewed the cases she always wrote extensive reports using my
comments and explaining them in more detail. The forum especially took most of
her and my time. But also the writing of the remedy book and the manual has
taken a lot out of her.
Since all of these activities cannot be done by anybody else we are forced to
stop all of them. The situation simply does not allow any other option.

I WILL NOT ALLOW KAROLINA TO SPEND ONE MORE MINUTE ON BIONTOLOGY.
She has been going down before my eyes. 

This all results in the following:

1. The Q&A’s will be done only two more times, in January and February 2016.
After this they will be finished. I already planned to retire from the Q&A's
and teaching in general after my 65th birthday.

2. The reports of the certification will not be as extensive as we did last
time. I will have to do them alone now and as usual my answering will be
telegram style.

3. The forum will continue to be read-only. The forum has grown into an
EXTENSIVE MANUAL and has been a continuous advanced course of 360 days per
year. Most of the questions are repeat questions that have already been
answered in one of the more then 1000 discussions that are already there.
Everything that you need to know is already there. There are multiple
practitioners that are doing an excellent job and they have received no more
training than anybody else, but they read the forum.
It is a misconception that you need more than is given on the forum and in the
manual. There is no need to do any courses by anybody else. Reading cases
should give you enough insight in how you should work and think. The best
certified biontologists told me they experience biontology more as a process of
unlearning previously held assumptions and societal ideas (for example letting
go of hypes around specific bacteria or viruses as THE cause of something),
than it is about gathering new information.

4. Our personal email addresses will be closed. They were never meant to ask us
questions. To accommodate new and recent students during their first year after
purchasing their Chiren, they will get a special email address to ask their
therapy questions. Technical questions can of course still be addressed to
Health Angel Academy.

5. There will be no more certification procedure as it is right now, but being
certified will maintain its value.
Those that will be certified this year, will get a certification for good. 
We may decide to keep the possibility for (permanent) certification without
feedback reports, that is if there is any interest in it. But this is not a
promise. I cannot make any promises at the moment. It is a very difficult
situation we find ourselves in. Karolina has unburdoned me greatly the past few
years, but even for the two of us everything became too much. 

6. Students will have at least one chance to get certified after a year of
practice.

I am sorry to bring you this message but I see no other way.
We tried to continue against all odds, and feel we have given a lot. All
possible biontology insights are now available to anyone who is interested.
Anyway, more than enough to practice successfully and safely. I hope you all
appreciate what Karolina has done for you. Without her I would have retired
from teaching long ago, and I would never have participated in a teaching forum
or given Q&A's. We did everything as a team and I am sad it had to end like
this. But I also think it is the right time. There were still things that
needed to be taught in 2015. But now no one misses out on necessary teachings.
I think Karolina managed to push herself until just this point. All is said
that needed to be said, and the Chirens have almost been sold out and it is
technically not possible to produce any more. As far as I am concerned her job
is finished. And it was a job well done.
Now it is up to all of you, both biophoton practitioners and biontologists, to
make best use of the resources and to maintain high professional standards.  

Johan

    If anyone reads more into this than the deep concern for me that Johan
    expresses, then please don't worry.

    When he says:

    "I WILL NOT ALLOW KAROLINA TO SPEND ONE MORE MINUTE ON BIONTOLOGY."

    It is just a very Dutch way of expressing himself. He means that teaching
    Biontology and keeping the business going have caused the situation I am in
    right now: exhaustion. And as you all know by now: If one doesn't remove
    the cause one cannot get well.

    Johan meant that he feels that I am more important right now than the
    business is. He never forced me to do or stop anything at all. Life forced
    me. It was just too much, and Johan is not the only one who warned me
    repeatedly. It was my own choice to struggle on for so long. If he had any
    say in it, he would have stopped me much earlier, which of course for my
    health would have been better. We have a relationship of mutual respect and
    freedom. But right now he is treating me, and of course "doctors' orders"
    are to keep my rest. ;-)

    Having to explain this, because something so innocent is used to attack
    Johan's integrity -he received a pretty nasty email from someone who has
    been harassing him for quite some time now, but seems to have credibility
    with some- is not at all what I like to do right now. Dealing with people
    who wear dirt-colored glasses is exhausting.

    Everyone else, who has expressed their concern and support, I would like to
    thank. It has been an honour working together with you to improve our
    understanding of Biontology. I have learned so much over the past few
    years, and even though it was a lot of work, I have also enjoyed the
    process of studying together. I am grateful to all of you who participated
    in this growth experience.

    Also I hope you don't see this as an ending. Although no new practitioners
    will be trained after the last Chirens have been sold, the idea for now is
    that existing practitioners will still be able to become certified, so the
    group of recognisable proficient Biontologists can continue to grow. There
    still is much to be done to create a coherent and responsible occupational
    field of Biontology. I don't know how many of you are interested in this,
    but if you are, it is now up to you to make that happen.

    There were some questions about certification. As Johan mentioned, it will
    maintain its value.
    Certified practitioners will be visible on the Biontology map and will also
    be mentioned to clients who seek a referral from the Health Angel office or
    from us personally.
    Although Johan and I will not be directly available anymore, we will try to
    keep the office open and will maintain the forum, be it in read only
    modality.

    For now I really need my rest. When more details are known they will be
    sent out by the office.

    Love,

    Karolina

Gallbladder - Cramping of the Vessels

Tufan GuvenTufan Guven
October 2015 edited November 2015 in General Questions Flag
Lately I have seen many people suffering from High Blood Pressure taking "
Angiotensin II receptor blocker" drugs or "Ace Inhibitors". These drugs for
High Blood Pressure account for narrowing of the arteries. I assume this is
what Johan calls "cramping of the blood vessels". These drugs block the effects
of "angiotensin", a chemical that causes the arteries to become narrow.

Questions

1. I would like to know how the Gallbladder effects and regulates the condition
of the Blood Vessels. 

2. What is the relationship between Gallbladder and Angiotensin? Or is there
any connection?

3. What are the common causes of the Gallbladder problem that leads to
narrowing/cramping of the Blood Vessels? Can it be Inflammation, degeneration,
hormonal or can it be anything?

    High blood pressure is caused by one or both the following causes:
    1) There is insufficient space for the fluids, and/or
    2) There is too much fluid​ in the available space

    Answers
    1. the Gallbladder system does not do anything to the condition of the
    Blood Vessels. But all the Blood Vessels are a whole series of pumps. This
    pumping is accomplished by contraction and dilation of the vessels. The
    Gallbladder system is responsible for this process. The Gallbladder system
    is very different than the physical gallbladder. There are more than 2
    billion muscles in the body. The Gallbladder system is responsible for the
    constriction and relaxation of all these muscles.
    Stress is a contracting factor. Continuous stress leads to continuous
    constriction and if this happens, it also affects the blood vessels thus
    leading to an increased blood pressure.

    2. My advice is to not try and mix up two very different ways of looking at
    the functioning of the body. We are looking at the energetic functioning of
    the body (as opposed to the chemical functioning) and this is sufficient to
    get the desired results in treatment. It would be an extensive study to
    correlate all hormones to the photon highways and pertaining Organ Systems,
    and this will not improve the effectiveness of your treatment.

    3. The causes of a Gallbladder problem can be any or all of the issues that
    you mention. But the main cause is stress in any form (chemical, disease,
    energetic, emotional, social, climatic, etc.). Whenever there is an
    excessive condition that needs to be balanced it causes stress. People with
    healthy Liver/Gallbladder systems are very flexible and adjust easily to
    change. Stress appears when a situation is too intense for someone to be
    able to adjust to it. What is experienced as stressful, varies from person
    to person.

Welcome to the new Biophoton website and forum.

On this forum all questions will be answered, but when asking questions, please
provide relevant information only. Also you need to give feedback if you
receive advice on treatments. The one giving the recommendations need to know
if his/her advice has been taken and he/she needs to know if his/her advice was
successful.
Please restrict your questions to those items which have to do with biophotons
and/or real biontology. All other questions are not allowed on the forum and
will be removed.
The old forum is still accessible and can be read, but nothing can be added
anymore.

I request that all practitioners use this forum to ask any questions that they
may have and that they do not ask their teachers directly anymore. They can ask
their teachers through this forum as well. Then all their fellow practitioners
can use the answers as well.

In 2013 we will be going into a new era of biontology whereby much stricter
rules will be applied. In the old era i have given everybody a lot of freedom.
It has appeared that this freedom has been taken too far and has lacked respect
and responsibility, which are two subjects that MUST go together with freedom.

I hope this new way of doing things will be even more successful than the old
way. It is a rebirth with numerous openings in this new times.

July 2014 edited July 2014 in Therapy Questions Flag
 NEW Client
Female, 34 years old

History
She has been trying to get pregnant for the last 7 years.

Medical History
In 2004 she was diagnosed with an Ulcer and a Hiatal Hernia. Her doctor said
the Hernia was too large to remove and that her sphinter muscle does not work
properly so she needs to be on Nexium. Recent tests have shown that the ulcer
is gone.

She also had her right fallopian tube removed due to an Ectopic pregnancy.

Medical Interventions
She has been on Nexium since 2004.
She has received In Vitro Fertilization 2 times and has been on IVF drugs.

Questions
1. This is the first client I have seen on acid reflux drugs. The protocol says
they need to come off of them immediately. Is there an easy way to do this? You
have mentioned in the past that drinking milk can help?

2. When it is time to work on the liver will that help with the Hiatal Hernia?

3. There is obvious stomach and intestinal issues with this client but besides
working on the intestines what should I not miss will Endometriosis?

I appreciate all your input.

    Simple use Natrium bi carbonat (baking soda), it must be pure (1/2
    coffiespoon) in half a glas of water a day could help on the reflux. Milk
    does not help.  

    Other things that are important:
    Proper food, 
    Non acid food but basic food ph high 
    Losing weight.

    The Liver always comes last in treatment

    1. Drinking up to half a glass of milk neutralises the acid. If you drink
    too much milk, the body starts to produce more acid to neutralise the milk
    again.
    In addition you need to treat the Gallbladder system.
   
    2. Hiatal Hernia is only part a Liver problem, the other organs that are
    involved are Pancreas and Spleen. These are yin organs, and time to work on
    them is when all the other organs except for the Liver are OK.
   
    3. I have not seen endometriosis often but every time there was a Spin
    Inversion,

    My client was in a Spin Inversion her first session but not her second
    session.

    I do understand to not treat the liver until the yang organs are clear.
    Many times the nosodes that clear the yang organs also clear the pancreas
    and spleen.

    Is it correct to assume that once the the liver/spleen/pancreas can be
    addressed that it should correct the shinter muscle problem?

    When an energetic problem is corrected, this does not mean that the
    physical will automatically follow. Some problems are structural and cannot
    be corrected by the body. He hiatal hernia is such a structural problem:
    the stomach has dropped through the muscles and that cannot be fixed by
    just energetic treatment.

    The problem with her sphincter muscle is a different problem than the
    hernia. But if it is caused by the lack of structural support of the
    stomach by the diaphragm, again it is a structural problem and you cannot
    do anything about it (apart from the symptom support with acid neutralisers
    as baking soda)

    My client was on vacation for 2 weeks. She decided to wait to go off her
    acid reflux drugs until she returned.
    Unfortunately her reflux is miserable and lasts all day. She does not get
    relief from baking soda or milk.

    I measured Ulcus Duodeni, Ulcus Ventriculi and Appendicitis Necroticans. 

    My question is since she measures that she does produce too much acid does
    that mean she still can't be treated if on acid neutralisers? SHe is so
    misreable that she wants to go back on them. Again as you mentioned above,
    if it is truly a structural problem than she has no choice.

    It is the PPIs that create therapy resistance. She could try to use other
    over the counter acid neutralising antacid-drugs and see if they might
    help.

    Hello everybody, 
    I have a client with a Hiatal hernia as well. I treated him completely but
    it looks impossible for me to clear his stomach. I only find drops on his
    upper two points of his stomach. 
    Accept for acid reflux one of his biggest complaints at this point is
    burning eyes. 
   
    Questions:
    1. Could burning of the eyes be caused by his hiatal hernia since the eyes
    and the stomach are connected? 
    2. Does anybody have any experience and or solution with or for an hiatal
    hernia? For example is it possible to fix with a good chiropractor?

    Answers:
    1. I personally have no experience with this. It may be possible. However I
    also wonder if she has any jaw or dental issues as it is the upper point of
    the Stomach meridian that keeps dropping, and it is common that dental
    problems can influence the eyes and cause tearing.
    2. Osteopaths sometimes can work wonders with hiatal hernias. I do not know
    if they can completely resolve the problem though. I believe it is more
    symptoms management.

Peripheral Neuropathy

TorilJelterTorilJelter
July 2015 edited August 2015 in Case Discussion Flag
Client
65 year old male. The first time I saw this client several weeks ago I was only
able to do an assessment because I wanted to ask Johan if it was OK to treat
after plasmaphoresis.

Symptoms
Neuropathy (numbness, tingling, burning, fleeting sharp stabbing pain) =>
located in lower legs (feet to knees), and underarms (hands to wrists)
Difficulties walking (gait difficulties) => walks with 2 canes
Lower back pain better with bent knees => past month
Mild depression
Occasional constipation
Blurry distance vision

Medical diagnoses
Peripheral neuropathy => suspected autoimmune origin
High blood pressure
Duputyrens contracture => both hands
Steroid induced diabetes => while on steroids
Kidney dysfunction => during plasmapheresis
Periodontitis

Timeline
Childhood vaccines
Insecticide exposure
Left arm broken => age 11
Chainsaw injury upper left arm => 10 years ago
"Neuropathy" => started 4 1/2 years ago (first in right foot, then left, then
fingers and hands)

Medical Interventions
Tonsillectomy => in childhood
Thyroglossal cyst surgery
Plasmapheresis => last 3 months ago, so OK to treat
Biopsies => nerves (2x) and bone marrow
MRI => spinal cord (no dye)
Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG)
Surgery of both hands (Duputyrens contracture) => 5 and 7 years ago

Dental work
Dental metal (gold and amalgam)
Gum work
Most molars extracted

Medication/Supplements
Steroids => in the past
Lisinopril => for hypertension
Gabapentin => for nerve pain
Aspirin (low dose) => for hypertension
Supplements/Multivitamin => no obvious benefit

Other Treatments
Laser therapy
Acupuncture => temporary relief

Exposures
EMF, WiFi, smart meter (on home) etc.


First Session

1st measurement:
Hormone System (L) - 2 proximal points
Heart (L) - 2 proximal points
Circulation (L) - 2 proximal points

All 6 Spin Inversion points drop => Spin Inversion program with blood in de cup
/spiral

2nd measurement
Spin Inversion resolved

Small Intestine (L) - 1 proximal point
Small Intestine (R) - 3 proximal points
Heart (R) - 1 distal point
Hormone System (R) - all points => Chronic Tonsillitis, Insecticides
Circulation (R) - all points => Barijodeel, Aurumheel, Aesculus
Nervous System (R) => all points
Lymphatic System (R) => 2 distal points

Observation: 
No drops on the feet, maybe due to masking because of medication OR not showing
up yet

Whiplash Treatment
I thought energetic Whiplash could have been caused by the tonsillectomy.

Scar Treatment
Throat and upper arms
Will look at the hands next visit for more scars

>12 Standard Program
Chronic Tonsillitis, Insecticides, Anti-Tetanus (not measured), Poliomyelitis
(not measured), Thalamus, Barijodeel, Aurumheel, Aesculus

3rd Measurement
No drops

I supported the Kidneys "just in case"

Footplate Treatment:
Solidago, Plantago, Populus, Reneel, Cerebrum, Viscum, Circulo, Tonico

Final measurement
Kidney still balanced

Suggestions given to client
I suggested lowering EMR (electromagnetic radiation) if reasonably possible.
Asked to not take Gabapentin right before session => try to take it several
hours earlier if necessary to avoid masking.

Integration
Interesting that mainly drops on right hand => maybe this is because of the
medication he uses OR long lasting suppression?
Energetic circulatory dysfunction may contribute to neuropathy symptoms.
It makes sense that the Nervous System points are dropping.
Since he had Kidney dysfunction past year on steroids I wanted to give maximum
Kidney support even without points dropping.
Bladder and Gallbladder meridian may be responsible for the lower back pain
(location) => will consider support if discomfort persists/will prioritize
supports for problems that have lasted longest first
Client was in Spin Inversion and 'seemed' to spontaneously resolve Spin
Inversion when he removed a HUGE metal watch from his wrist BUT I think Johan
said this is not possible...? After watch removal I got no drops I suspect this
was medication induced OR endorphin high.

Questions
1. Could Gabapentin and/ or aspirin cause measurement interference?
2. Is it appropriate to request that medications not be taken right before
session (depending on when they have peak effect?)
3. What should I have done differently?
4. Can metal watch removal allow electron spininversion to resolve?
5. Do you think he will be able to wear this watch again and tolerate the
disturbance once he completes a biophoton series assuming he gets adequately
treated and cleared?
6. Do you think the steroid could still be disturbing his biophotons and result
in his treatment series being prolonged even though he stopped steroids many
months ago?
7. IF the 3rd measurement shows no drops after standard program is it OK to
just check the Kidney meridian at the end after the Footplate treatment rather
than doing a complete 4th measurement of hands and feet?

    Gabapentin and aspirin are analgesics so they will increase endorphins. 
    The presenting disease itself may be endorphic in nature.  I would suspect
    all readings to be in question.  I do ask my patients who take meds like
    steroids to try to refrain from taking them before a session, this seems to
    work since the results show progress.

    Comments to Session 1, post of July 10 - Inserted here to make order
    chronological
   
    You did treat Whiplash, and this is indeed important, but your reasoning is
    not right. It is important to do things for the right reason. Tonsillectomy
    does not cause Whiplash.
    If he has a broken arm, you can be sure he has a Whiplash, not from the
    tonsillectomy, but because he has had an accident. This is also confirmed
    by the drop on the Thyroid point. When someone has been vaccinated with
    Anti-Tetanus, the Parathyroid is always disturbed. So you have a situation
    where both Thyroid and Parathyroid points are affected, and thus you should
    treat Whiplash for this reason (protocol).

    When Parathyroid is not balanced yet at the beginning of the treatment
    (from the above you may conclude that it is a certainty that it was not),
    there is no use yet treating with calcification remedies like Barijodeel,
    Aurumheel or calculi.

    Lower back pain may also be caused by different leg lengths.

    There may indeed be a lot of masking because of the medication. This can be
    the cause for the lack of drops on the Hormone System, but Yang Organs are
    not very likely to suppress. An example of a picture one may see with a lot
    of masking is a few drops on some Yang Organs and no or few drops on the
    Yin Organs while the symptoms and stage of treatment (first treatment
    normally the Pituitary and Parathyroid always drop) indicate that there is
    a discrepancy between reality and what is measured.

    There are all kinds of symptoms that are not explained by your
    measurements. For example:
    Blurry distant vision => maybe Stomach, but can also be a muscle tension
    problem = Gallbladder
    Constipation => he must have drops on his Intestines
    Periodontitis => he must have drops on his Stomach meridian (Jaw point)

    Answers to your questions
    1. Possibly. The medical drugs (Aspirin) have as an effect that the body
    starts producing endorphins. These endorphins are the pain stilling effect
    and the relaxing effect that is exercised on the Blood Vessels.
    The high blood pressure medication has a bad effect on the Kidneys.
    But since you encounter measurement problems more often I also wonder about
    your treatment space. Are you trill treating from your van?
    2. It totally depends on the kind of medication taken. Medication to
    suppress acute inflammation for example (e.g. Cortison) can not just be
    stopped before you have treated the underlying condition or else you will
    have a (severe) flare-up. Some medication that is only meant for
    "prevention" can easily be stopped for a couple of days or even completely
    if it does not have an addictive component to it.
    Stopping painkillers for a couple of days will pose no other risk than
    discomfort/pain, so you can discuss this and leave the choice to your
    client.
    3. I would have tried a remedy like Botulism because it is a food poisoning
    whereby also the nervous system is affected. Further I would have tried the
    Intestinal Flora bacteria on the Kidneys.
    4. Not directly or immediately, but since a watch may interfere with the
    body's energy field it can certainly add to the sensitivity to Spin
    Inversion. So in other words, the removal of the watch cannot reverse a
    Spin Inversion, but it could result in energetic disturbances to go away.
    You can check the points without the watch and with the watch. If the watch
    causes disturbances in the measurements, I would recommend that this client
    does not wear his watch any more. It is known that the more expensive
    watches cause more problems than the cheaper ones. it is of course best to
    wear a kinetic watch, without battery
    5. It is possible that at one point your client will be able to handle the
    watch better, but if you found it to be a true causative factor, which
    means that there is a huge improvement the week after he removed the watch,
    and before the removal of the watch this improvement was not there, then I
    would certainly advise him to throw away the watch. But this is not certain
    yet. Your measurements need to prove themselves in results.
    6. Possibly. The steroids could have damaged his Hormonal Glands, or if his
    body's detox functions are impaired and the steroids might still impact the
    functioning of the body.
    7. If the 3rd measurements show no drops, there is no reason to check the
    Kidneys another time because you have already measured them. However, the
    Kidneys not showing any weaknesses is suspicious considering "Kidney
    dysfunction during plasmapheresis"

    Second Session

    Progress:
    Lighter mood
    Less 'neuropathic' discomfort of hands and feet
    Less swelling of feet

    1st measurement
    Hormone System (L) - 2 proximal points
    Heart (L) - 2 proximal points
    Circulation (L) - 2 proximal points

    All 6 Spin Inversion points drop => Spin Inversion program with blood in de
    cup/spiral

    2nd measurement
    Spin Inversion resolved

    Hormone System (R) - all points
    Circulation (R) - all points
    Small Intestine (R) 1 proximal point

    Scar Treatment
    Client remembers more scars on hand palm (left) and ankle (right)
    Also treated the contracture of the right palm as a 'scar'

    3rd Measurement
    Earlier drops resolved
    Circulation (R) - new drops
    Circulation (L) => Barijodeel

    >12 Standard Program
    Barijodeel, Aurumheel, Aesculus, Anti-tetanus, Poliomyelitis, Circulo,
    Tonico, Mucosa (Small Intestine)

    4th Measurement
    Old drops gone on right hand and left hand. Still no drops on feet. New
    drops on:
    Organ degeneration (R) - 3 distal points
    Nervous System (L) - Mercury (will wait until more confident excretory
    organs are OK, I still suspect some interference from medications)

    Footplate Treatment
    Solidago, Reneel, Plantago, Populus, Selenium, Berberis, Nux Vomica,
    Nervoheel
    (I supported Kidneys, Circulation, Small Intestine and Nervous System)

    Final Measurement
    Kidneys - no drops

    Integration
    Interesting to see what scar treatments did resolve some drops and allowed
    others to show up.
    Looks like the Circulatory dysfunction is important.
    Will hold off on Heavy Metal (Mercury from fillings) treatment until
    excretory organs are likely functioning OK. Expect Organ Degeneration drops
    will resolve as other drops are addressed.
    I repeated Anti-Tetanus and Poliomyelitis because I was concerned that the
    Spin-Inversion after last time didn't allow adequate clearing.
    Client did wear heavy metal watch occassionally which weakens his energy.
    He also spends alot of time on WiFi etc.

    Suggestions to client
    I asked the client to try to avoid medications before session if possible.

    Questions
    1. What could I have done better/ different?
    2. How is 5 element teaching helpful here?

    Third Session

    Update:
    Local university Hospital has dismissed him from their care as they have no
    more to offer. 
    Not wearing metal watch at all
    Found out he drinks alcohol
   
    Progress:
    Felt overall improved for 6 days =>  Pain increasing past 24 hours
    Feels some optimism => first time in 2 years
    Ankle swelling => continues to improve
    Back pain => less severe, right side more severe than left side
    Foot pain => less severe, despite not using Gabapentin

    Measurement:
    Electron Spin Inversion => solved with Spin Inversion Treatment with blood

    Circulation (L) - all points => Calculi Bil (added Calculi Renales to
    improve likelihood kidneys energetically healthy enough to deal with heavy
    metals)
    Heart (L) - all points

    Circulation (R) - all points
    Nervous System (R) - all points => Mercury (will hold of for now)
    Large Intestine (R) - all points => Appendicitis Necroticans +
    Tuberculinum 
    Lymphatic System (R) - all points => Tuberculinum

    Liver (L) - 2 distal points
    Stomach (L) -1 distal point

    Kidney (R) - all points => Plantago  (should have checked for a nosode
    first)
    Liver (R) - 1 proximal point  

    >12 Standard Program
    Appendicitis Necroticans, Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis, Tuberculinum,
    Calculi Bili, Calculi Renales, Plantago, Barijodeel (circulation support)

    2nd Measurement
    No drops

    Footplate Treatment
    Aurumheel, Aesculus,Populus, Solidago, Reneel, Thalamus, Lymphomyosot, Nux
    Vomica 

    Integration 
    This is 3rd time that there is Spin Inversion, so we need to figure out
    what is causing this. I suspect magnetic fields.
    Hold off on treating Liver and Heavy Metals until excretion organs balanced
    upon arrival. 

    Questions
    A. When there are drops on an organ system that is not part of the focus, s
    hould I check for what matches anyways?
    B. I probably didn't need to add Chronic Appendicitis and Appendicitis, but
    I am nervous about triggering an acute Appendicitis? Is this possible?

    Answers to second and third sessions

    1. "What could I have done better?"
    Answer = Comments to this case in general:
    * Polyneuropathy, in my experience, is caused by the Circulation and not
    the Nervous System. So problems normally will be found on the Circulatory
    meridians and not the Nervous System meridians.
    Without exception I have seen polyneuropathy resolve by focussing on the
    Circulation.
    * When there are symptoms of lower back pain and issues with gait, I will
    always look first at the length of the legs. Most likely you will find a
    difference and this is caused by the Gallbladder System. If this is the
    case, you need to treat the legs according to the protocol for different
    leg length, which is described in the manual, and then focus on the
    Gallbaldder in order to solve the underlying cause.
    * Whenever you measure Appendicitis Necroticans and at the same time there
    are drops on the Kidneys, almost without exception this is caused by
    Intestinal Flora infections.
    * Plantago is a Bladder remedy, not a Kidney remedy

    2. "How is 5 element teaching helpful here?"
    Answer: It is not

    A. "When there are drops on an organ system that is not part of the focus,
    should I check for what matches anyways?"
    Answer: That is your own choice, it is not necessary but sometimes you can
    do this if you feel like you need more information.

    B. "I probably didn't need to add Chronic Appendicitis and Appendicitis,
    but I am nervous about triggering an acute Appendicitis? Is this possible?"
    Answer: It is highly unlikely to get acute appendicitis when Appendicitis
    Necroticans still matches. So you should not worry about that.

Certification

SVitale
November 2014 edited November 2014 in Questions for the H.A.A. Flag
Hello Johan, Karolina,

I am confused as to the path to certification.  I have noticed that the recent
communications by Johan have been different in some ways as to the process of
certification. When I joined in March I was given a number of classes that were
suppose to be part of the path to certification, This seems changed and I don't
know if I qualify for certification without the psychology class or the
emeopathy.  Can I get a clarification on this?  It seems rather timely, and I
don't know if I can get my cases ready in time if I do qualify, anyway.  Since
my schedule conflicted with the psychology and since I have been out of the
loop since I have not be able to attend Renate's class due her exclusion of me,
I have been confused and perplexed.

    Hi Stefano,

    Renate's mentoring classes do not have anything to do with the academy or
    certification. I do NOT agree with excluding people from classes, but since
    these are her own initiative I cannot do anything about it. I am sorry you
    thought these classes are a necessity for certification. 

    (Additional note:
    Renate is not a Certified Biontologists and Health Angel Academy has no
    insight whatsoever in what is being taught in her classes. If you decide to
    join these classes, it is advised to verify everything by comparing the
    information received with this forum and the manual. These two resources
    should be leading in your journey to learn Biontology. Renate also has
    never had access to more information about Biontology than all of you have
    access to right now, so there cannot be any additional advantage to
    following these classes beyond receiving some basic guidance. I am afraid
    that Renate will start to divert from protocol by including all kinds of
    other therapies and ideas that will distract from Biontology and confuse
    students. I have already received some indications that this is what is
    happening.)

    Emeopathy class was useful when there were no good descriptions of the
    remedies yet. With the Biontology Remedy Book there is no absolute need for
    it anymore. 

    The most important part of certification is to present the case studies and
    show that you understand Biontology and work in line with it's principles.
    If you at least manage to do that in time certification is possible. All
    the changes make it impossible to follow the route of certification, as
    presented before, strictly. 

    Case-studies every year should be ready before December.

    IABS does not exist anymore, and is not organising classes beyond the ones
    that were already planned and only if there are enough participants. 

    The idea for the future is that some certified practitioners might continue
    to provide some advanced classes themselves, but we cannot make it a
    requirement anymore. 

    I understand that there are still some questions about the certification
    process, so I will try to summarize some of the specifics:

    1. Certification is taken over by Health Angel Academy, and case studies
    should be submitted to Robert in the Netherlands.
    2. To qualify for certification you need to present 3 case studies of fully
    recovered clients and show an understanding of Biontology and the protocols
    in your explanations.
    3. To present the cases, the exact same format needs to be used as last
    year. This format is included in the updated manual
    4. Because last year was the first year of certification everyone who had
    submitted 3 case-studies was certified. The cases we received showed that
    the certification process was prematurely installed, as hardly anyone
    worked in line with Biontology yet. We wanted to give everyone more time to
    study the proper materials and forum.
    5. This year Johan is not going to certify just everyone anymore. There has
    been enough time to study the forum and new manual to understand the
    protocols and the case studies should reflect this. Personal feedback will
    be given.
    6. Only those who are certified are legally allowed to use Biontology or
    Biontologist on their websites, e-mail addresses or to refer to themselves
    as Biontologists verbally or in any other way.
    7. Certification is meant to raise the professional bar, and to protect
    everyone who is serious about Biontology against the distortions that are
    spread by some. If practitioners who are reckless and unprofessional in
    their contact with clients can call themselves Biontologists this will
    reflect negatively on everyone in the field.
    8. Everyone who is not certified can still remain affiliated with Health
    Angel academy as a Chiren practitioner and receive information, forum and Q
    &A access and support provided required fees have been paid to Health Angel
    Academy.

    I hope this clarifies some of the questions.
  •

    Thank you.  One more question.  Can we submit the cases anytime next year,
    or does Certification only happen in December?  Secondly, are we to repeat
    this process every year, or is Certification a one time process?  In
    otherwords, do we 'graduate' once or is this an ongoing process.?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    November 2014 Flag
    You can submit the case studies at any time, but reviewing cases and the
    granting of certificates itself only happens once a year. 

    Certification is a an ongoing process and we hope that once the case
    presentations reach a certain standard they can serve as a database for
    successful Biontology treatments and possibly as examples for other
    practitioners (anonymous and with permission of course).

    thanks...this brings up the other payment level, there is a "certification
    fee" and then a fee for 'biontologist'.  Is this the same without the title
    'biontologist'?

    Oh, maybe I confused the matter.  Previously we had two possibilties: one
    was certified and the other was biontologist.  How has this changed ?  It
    seems we do not have the level 'biontologist', only certification?

    Karolina,
    When I took Basic One in February of this year, we were told that there
    were two levels of certification.  The first level was Chiren Practitioner
    and required presentation of one case study.  The second level was
    Biontologist which required three case studies.  On the basis of that I was
    planning on submitting one case study.  It sounds like that is no longer
    the case and that I can be a Chiren Practitioner without submitting any
    case studies.  Is that a correct understanding?
    Thank you!

    Sophia: I was only writing about certification. To become a Chiren
    practitioner you still need to submit one case-study, but that can be done
    any time you feel ready.
   
    Stefano: As Sophia wrote correctly there are two levels. Chiren
    Practitioner and Certified Biontologist. Before you are certified you
    cannot call yourself a Biontologist. That is the distinction. Again,
    financial and administrative matters are handled by the Health Angel
    Academy. I have sent your question to Robert in the Netherlands.

EMF - Aggravation of Myoclonus

    I am noticing that after long sessions balancing others or myself with the
    Chiren, my ear condition (myoclonus) worsens and is also more sensitive to
    EMFs. 
   
    Other symptoms:
    General weakness 
    Pulling in my heart area 
    Feelings of discomfort and heat when wearing metal jewellery => stopped
    wearing them many months ago 
    Ear sensitivity improves after a successful treatment takes hold and I am
    rested 
   
    I think the worsening of symptoms is due to exhaustion (Gallbladder) and
    dehydration. 
    Strengthening the body should help symptoms. 
   
    Questions:
    Is there any risk the gold electrode is too conductive for the
    electrosensitive?

    Some EMF sensitive people may need VERY short sessions to begin with OR IF
    they were recently significantly sensitized. Keep assessment to a minimum
    til you know how sensitive they are. 

    I have had a wide range of reactions from one woman who can't be treated
    because she gets too uncomfortable to others that tolerate everything we
    'normally' do. 

    One woman was very frightened of the electric exposure of the assessment
    BUT felt SO much better after spin inversion she didn't want to quit even
    after her light was balanced (5 sessions) 

    One interesting case had EMF sensitivity + brain stem stroke + likely
    mercury toxicity. I JUST checked for spin inversion. Got her out of spin.
    Then checked for whiplash as she wanted minimal exposure to electric
    current. I figured she had energetic whiplash and treated and her brain fog
    lifted and she made eye contact. Before she was making very poor eye
    contact. Then I did the footplates and she tolerated regular full
    assessments after that. 

    BUT in general these people seem to benefit from limited or very targeted
    assessments is my impression. Also helping them limit their overall
    exposures elsewhere may help.

    Also some people that have been mostly in Spin Inversion before they come
    to you are "zombie-like" so they aren't very aware. So when they are
    improving they start noticing more things because they are more 'with it'
    if that makes sense. When they are more 'with it' their awareness can now
    help protect them IF they listen to/ observe their symptoms and what makes
    them better & worse.

    Thanks, Tori, very helpful.

    I am the one with the sensitivity and have been practicing measurement and
    the protocol on family members and myself. Will take it slower, perhaps.
    Good news is I notice that despite some discomfort during measuring,
    treating with the chiren usually provides a sense of well-being and calm to
    the practitioner, too. Don't know if this is common.

    Answer:
    In theory it is possible that the Golden Rod and the metal Wire also act as
    an antenna. I never have seen this but I think it is possible for someone
    who has metal in their body.
    With the Glass Rods and Fibre-Optic cables this is not possible.

    The main focus to get rid of electro-sensitivity, however, is getting
    people out of Spin Inversion and strengthening the body so it can stay out
    of Spin Inversion.

    Continuing symptoms immediately after exposure to invisible trigger,
    including EMR: 
    * Random pulsing mostly in left ear
    * Hollowed out pain sensation in both ears 
    * Soreness on either side of neck along lymph and tonsil areas 
    * Headaches on top of head, temples, and base of skull Certain ranges of
    voices coming over a standard (not cellular) speakerphone also trigger
    pulsing in ear 
    * Tension in left-side of chest and heart 
    * Often, pulling feeling/light stabbing pain to right of navel. 

    Likely main causal factor: 
    My top molars => especially, the left molar corresponding to peripheral
    arteries and middle ear (thanks, Stefano), a source of infection and
    soreness since shortly after a fall and possible concussion last October.
    This timing also corresponds to when I first started noticing
    electrosensitivity. 

    The molar was removed over a month ago 
    Due for implant in Sept, but searching for alternatives including simply
    letting sinus hole heal. 

    Recent treatment: 
    Spin inversion 
    Localized scar treatments =>  ears and jaw
    Kieferostitis and Granuloma Denti have not been measured by and on me of
    late. 
    Am measuring and clearing mostly Hormonal, Kidney, and lately Gallbladder
    disturbances to get to more deeper unmasking. 

    Questions: 
    1. What to treat first? The sharpest drops? The organs one summises after
    analysis to be most affected, even if drops are slower? 
    2. Is it best that a practitioner be well, or can I during self-treatment
    attempt to balance others? 
   
    I am beginning to think there is a larger energetic disturbance here. 
    Over the years I have had many procedures/health events that may introduce
    more complexity to overall treatment approach, including more notably: 
    * A very bad tear during natural childbirth which required countless
    stitches 
    * Abad accident to my right calf along the stomach meridian 
    * Cosmetic ruby laser surgery to area under right eye that left me with a
    host of immune issues for over a year 
    * Lifestyle and environmental disturbances

    Energetic disturbances in the living space can create pain in the body for
    those of us so sensitive. I had my home check by a certified environmental
    building specialist. We discovered very strong Radio Waves, Electric waves
    and Magnetic waves, and fault lines on the land near by.

    It's been very difficult to use any computers or cellphones. Don't use the
    portable phones at all. they are the worst.
    Good luck.

    Thanks, Barbara. I should do a home audit as I suspect issues, including

    standards, and manufacturers.

    If your top molars are the cause, then one must look underneath. They must
    have been severely infected causing abscesses. Are these abscesses still
    there. You can try the remedies Myristica Sebifera (if you have this) or
    the remedy Periproctic Abscess.
    Any metal implant might make the situation worse.
    The cosmetic surgery could be doing something and the lifestyle/
    environmental could contribute to it.

    Answers:
    1. What to treat first: It all depends what you mean by sharp drops. If the
    drops are really sharp, it means that the disturbances are energetic, i.e.
    non-physical. Indeed I would try to balance those first. But then you need
    to find the cause for these interferences. Remedies like Fringed Violet or
    Ozaliet could be helpful.
    2. The symptoms indicate all Gallbladder problems. The malfunctioning
    Gallbladder system is likely to have affected other systems in the body.
    You of course can start to help others while you are going through this
    process. In doing others you might discover important clues for yourself

    I too often feel better after treating people. Doing Biontology work
    strengthens me and makes it less likely that I go into Spin Inversion.
   
    Regarding the person with more myoclonus after treating/ treatment: 
    Maybe you could try a battery pack instead of plugging into the wall. 
    Theoretically it is possible that your outlet isn't grounded properly and
    could transmit some unwanted 'dirty electricity'. 
    I almost always use a battery pack to not have to 'second guess' or analyze
    my power source. 
   
    The best article I have seen on treating EHS (electrohypersensitivity) is
    called EHS: Fact or Fiction? by Dr. Genuis LINK 
    Unfortunately he doesn't mention Biontology BUT he does mention stress
    reducing complementary healing modalities and he has a nice list of
    healthier ways of using technology. 
   
    I use the following to measure the 3 most important fields:
    Acoustimeter for RF (available at lessemf)
    Trifield for magnetic fields
    Stetzerizer for dirty electricity

    You can rent some of these by contacting Michael Neuert at emfinfo OR
    emfcenter

    Thank you all for such helpful information. I have also been doing some
    research into EMR and environmental disturbances. Over the past few months,
    I have:
      □ Avoided wearing and carrying any metal or jewelry on my body; and been
        mindful of sources in my environment;
      □ Attempted to reduce overall exposure though this is an occupational
        hazard at the moment and requires much negotiation at home since many
        Americans have become dependent on these very sources;
      □ Scheduled, finally, to remove dental work (amalgam fillings) to see if
        this helps. I have already derived some relief of symptoms after a
        tooth extraction of a remaining root canal in my top molar.
      □ Performed whiplash and Spin Inversion treatments, when necessary. I
        always need this.
    I will surely keep in mind the approach and remedies Johan has suggested
    above. Periproctic abcess has been one of the remedies I've measured and
    used on myself without understanding it had any relation to my teeth.
    Endlessly fascinating what I measure on myself and others.

    Here is another resource link I have found that, interestingly enough,
    mentions how the chiren and spin treatments helped another electrosensitive
    person restore his health:

    Electrical-Sensitivity 

    In the mean time, I have continued to treat family members who need
    immediate help. I have continued to notice that treating others has made me
    maintain some level of calmness, possible added health benefits, and
    certainly a sense of purpose. Not sure if there was endorphin or other
    masking going on, but the last time I treated myself I only needed 3
    nosodes to clear all my meridians -- a first!

    One final resource I find eye-opening is the book "Living Safely with
    Electromagnetic Radiation" (it seems you really can't) by Jim Waugh.

    The greatest challenge for myself and family members has been learning to
    cut out unnecessary stress and the belief systems enabling the modern type
    A, go-getting lifestyle. This, I expect, will take longer to work out :-).

    Forgot to thank you, Toril, too!

    I have a trifield meter and was just going to order a stetzerizer this week
    as I suspect dirty electricity. Will check out your added suggestions of
    the battery pack and acoustimeter.

    To other electrosensitive sufferers among us, shielding clothing from
    lessemf.com has been a recent necessity for me in my tech job. I especially
    like the Silverell hoodie, socks, gloves, and tank. As these get expensive,
    the Dept of Defense uses a laundry detergent sold online that makes all
    clothes shielding. Cannot find the link but will post when I do.

    I truly hope in the near future, governments takes some immediate action to
    protect public health and others won't have to look like i currently do --
    like I handle hazardous waste in a chinese semiconductor factory…LOL

    Dear Kat,
    It is difficult to evaluate if the changes that have/or are taking place
    are exciting or troubling, because without the "respect" of communication
    we do not have enough information to evaluate... could you please share
    with us, students and new practitioners what your position in the

    Cheryl, I do understand your concern and thank you for expressing it. There
    is however a need for us to prepare an official statement based on
    decisions that are still in the process of evaluation and that depends on
    people and circumstances. Prematurely releasing our thought processes would
    only create more confusion. We have been in a constant state of flux
    ourselves. Information that we did not even have a month ago needs our
    attention too.

    All will be communicated soon. Believe me we are not on a "holiday" at all.

    The only thing I can say is that there is no intention of complete
    abandonment even if operations will be moved back to Europe. Q&A's and
    Forum will continue to be there for support  and the European office will
    handle repair issues.
    We are working on finding the best way to keep some support available in
    the US, through a practitioner support group.

    already know, I am not alone in having it. Without communication -- there
    is speculation, I believe even a "limited amount" of honest information and
    transparency helps foster mutual respect and reduce stress, so thank you
    for doing so. It is good to hear "no intention of complete abandonment"
    ...and that there is a commitment to future Q&As and the FORUM, the support
    systems that we were told came with good standing in the Biontology
    organization and so fundamental to a new practitioner's growth/competency.

    holiday closings" not a reference to holidays in your personal lives. Also

    Dear Cheryl, So very well said, I concur.  Biontology, I hope, is a
    community of concerned, compassionate and tolerant people, both in the
    field as well as in IABS.  Any of my communictions with IABS has been
    nothing less than that.  I believe both Johan and Karolina have a vision
    and a scope large enough to make Biontology work with all these attributes
    and more.  My sense is that this is determined by all of us, as we each
    play a part in it's success.  We need to guard against Ego trips, arrogant
    beliefs and Lightless goals  Thank you Karolina for the heads up on
    things.  I am looking forward to your letter and I welcome change, I hope
    to be as positive as critically possible!  I don't envy IABS's challenge
    but I do welcome a movement towards a more protocol oriented education as
    reflected in the enormous work Karolina has taken on in the new protocol
    and her remedy book.

Clinical Pearls of the Master

SVitale
July 2015 edited August 2015 in Learning Biontology Flag
This page is meant to list quotes from Johan and/or Karolina that are not
listed in the protocol. The attempt is to add common occurring combinations of
remedies that are often used in a protocol-like way. Of course, all entries
would be reviewed and, if necessary corrected by the "Masters".

Calculi
Whenever you treat with Calculi Bil, it is helpful to also put in Calculi
Renales or the other way around.
These nosodes are also good to treat for any calcification and Calculi Renales
might be helpful in treating for oxalate sensitivity. 

Appendicitis
If there are many points dropping, then the first indication is Appendicitis
and/or Tonsillitis. I first try Appendicitis Necroticans. If it does not match
or does not match all the points on the Large Intestine, then I also try
Chronic Appendicitis to see if it brings balance to the rest of the intestinal
points. if points on the Lymph meridian are dropping, I first would try the
Chronic Tonsillitis (from,Appendicitis (Necroticans, Chronic & Acute)

Acute Appendicitis
You only treat what you measure. Chronic Appendicitis is the only exception.
Then I put in acute Appendicitis to prevent a flare up.
I only use Appendicitis in case of Chronic Appendicitis, because I want to
prevent an acute flare up of the Appendicitis after treatment. I don't do this
with Chronic tonsillitis or with Appendicitis Necroticans (next step will be
Chronic Appendicitis so not acute)

    Heavy Metals
    Heavy Metals should not be treated in a first session.
    Measuring Heavy Metals on the Hormone System (if nothing else matches,
    which is rare) does pose a problem, since the Hormone System always comes
    first in treatment, and on the other hand treating with Heavy Metals causes
    a big burden on the elimination system.(from Early Puberty)

    Intestinal Flora
    When you use the Intestinal Bacteria in your Chiren Treatment before the
    Intestines are healthy it won't work to repopulate the Intestinal Flora,
    but it doesn't create problems. 

    However, if these bacteria cause infections anywhere in the body (e.g.
    Kidneys), they need to be used in their capacity as nosodes much earlier in
    treatment.

    Toxicity and Overtreatment
    However, when you do find more than one toxin it will not likely be more
    than two or at the most three. When the elimination channels are healthy
    and you use plenty of support this does not pose a problem in treatment.

    What does create a problem is treating with all kinds of toxins that are
    not measured. In measurement only the most prevalent disturbance -that is
    why it is usually only one toxin/metal- is shown, and this is the
    disturbance that the body needs to address first. But that doesn't mean
    that there is no resonance with other toxins/metals you may put in the
    slots that are not measured... So if you do this, you force the body beyond
    a point that is natural and comfortable, making it do too much at the same
    time.

    When Parathyroid is not balanced yet at the beginning of the treatment

    There may indeed be a lot of masking because of the medication. This can be
    the cause for the lack of drops on the Hormone System, but Yang Organs are
    not very likely to suppress. An example of a picture one may see with a lot
    of masking is a few drops on some Yang Organs and no or few drops on the
    Yin Organs while the symptoms and stage of treatment (first treatment
    normally the Pituitary and Parathyroid always drop) indicate that there is
    a discrepancy between reality and what is measured.

    Hemorrhoid and Calcification
    Specific treatment approach for haemorrhoids caused by calcified valves:
    I would treat with Barijdeel and Aurumheel, possibly also with Aesculus.
    When the calcification is gone, treatment with Hamamelis and Melllilotus
    can be used to treat the valves themselves.
    Nux Vomica is also a good supportive remedy for haemorrhoids

    Spin Inversion
    Conditions like Spin-Inversion work directly against the body and can be
    considered a cause for auto-immune disease.

    If Electron Spin Inversion keeps coming back, one needs to immediately find
    the cause and remove it.

    When someone's in Spin Inversion all the time you won't get any real
    results. 

    Somebody who's low in energy easily gets into Spin Inversion. How are her
    Adrenals? 
   
    Cell Phone radiation weakens the aura and thus the ability of the body to
    protect against Spin Inversion.

    Prostate Inflammation:  
    When it is prostate inflammation, this is probably a bacterial issue,
    most likely caused by Bacterium Proteus. When you find this on the
    Bladder meridian, it is likely you find this on the Kidneys as well. The
    kidneys are very high in the protocol, far before the Bladder....

    When the cause of the urinary issues is an enlarged prostate, this is
    usually caused by the Circulatory system, which then needs to be
    addressed first. ...

    However, if you have space in your slots, it does not go against
    protocol to use Atropinum or Zincum Valerianicum as a support. These
    remedies are general relaxants and will not initiate a healing action in
    the Gallbladder.

    Lifestyle is of major importance to address when there is Aura Weakness.

    Kidneys and Rheumatoid Arthritis: 
     Rheumatoid arthritis is always caused by the Kidneys, and considering the
    seriousness of her illness the focus should be completely on the Kidneys.
    This is of the utmost urgency. If you do not treat this before you do
    anything else, problems will get far worse and she might go into Kidney
    failure, especially with the increased detox that every Chiren treatment
    always gives.

    Question
    Is it possible that the Stomach and Gallbladder will show after the Large
    Intestine improves?
   
    Answer
    Perhaps, but the Stomach and Gallbladder are yang organ systems and they
    normally do not suppress. IF they suppress, it means that they are in a
    terrible condition.

    Thyroid point
    Before you try Strumeel on the Thyroid point, make sure you have tried all
    possible nosodes first. Nosodes are always preferred over support remedies.
    When you find Strumeel on the Thyroid, this indicates either a problem in
    the iodine metabolism or iodine deficiency. The first may be corrected by
    this remedy, the second needs supplementation, preferably through iodine
    rich food (e.g. seaweed) or otherwise you may try a drop of nascent
    iodine.

    Hi Karolina,

    I'd like to ask you a question: How do I treat Hernia Umbilicaris (navel
    rupture) in a Jack Rusell.

    I suspect it's not a birth defect. The dog is 7 almost 8 years old.

    Measurement shows remedies like Arnica, Aesculus, Apis, Belladonna,
    Circulo, Lymphomyosot, Calm and Clear and Cutis. But I think I didn't solve
    the cause.

    The bulging navel area is influenced by the treatment. It's smaller and
    softer but it's not gone.

    Can you advise me what to focus on? Or do you have other suggestions? 

    Thanks for answering my questions,

    Els Gorisse

    Hello Els,
   
    Dank je voor je deelname aan het forum, juist omdat je Engels moeilijk
    vindt. Volgende keer is het denk ik het handigst als je je vraag gewoon in
    het Nederlands post en dat ik hem vertaal. (Ik heb nu je mail moeten
    ontcijferen doordat je waarschijnlijk google translate hebt gebruikt?) Ik
    hoop dat het je wel lukt om alles een beetje te begrijpen in het Engels....
   
   
    Answer: Umbilical hernia's are caused by weakness of the musculature of the
    abdominal wall. Since the strength of muscles is controlled by the Liver,
    this is where your focus should be.

Removed Adrenal Gland - No Results

Gylfi
May 2013 edited January 2014 in Therapy Resistance Flag

Client:
56 years old man with one Adrenal Gland removed.

Symptoms:
Abdominal Pain, Air coming up, Lot of Anxiety, High Blood Pressure,

Measurement:
Always same Organ Systems: Stomach, Small and Large Intestines, Circulation,
Hormonal System and sometimes Liver

Treatment:
Every time I'm able to correct all points, but in the next treatment all drops
seem to reappear.

I suspected Spin-Inversion, but I have never measured that. I have followed all
the protocol. and I have been focusing on the Gallbladder last few times. But
what is most bothering me is that both Pitutary and Parathyroid are always
dropping again, and its almost never the same Remedy that I use to clear them.

Question:
I was wondering if removal of one of the Adrenals can be the reason that I'm
not getting any results...

    First of all I would like to know why the Adrenal Gland was removed in the
    first place.... Maybe this holds a clue...

    Regarding the Pituitary and Parathyroid dropping every time.... I'm
    wondering if there's an Energy/Aura problem. Is he sensitive or exposed
    frequently to Radiation/EMF? Have you tried Ozaliet or maybe Montmorronite
    (if you have that remedy)?

    There is still one Adrenal active, so if this gland is working properly the
    body should be able to function normally. Usually one gland will compensate
    for the loss of the other... How does the Adrenal point measure?

    The removed Adrenal gland had a Small Tumor.  I don't find any drops on the
    Adrenal point though.   
   
    The client is really Stressed and I suspect that the Tumor was caused by
    this. He is really uptight and answers very fast when I talk with him. 
   
    When I asked him about his environment, no exposure to any radiation could
    came up... He seems sensitive though.
    I have not tried Ozaliet and will try next time. I don't have
    Montmorronite. 

    It seems like I'm not getting anywhere with him, since the same meridians
    keep dropping. The Pituitary and Parathyroid are not clearing....


    Question:
    When there's sensitivity to Radiation, should I then treat Ozaliet every
    time?  
    What about Causticum? should I use that?  
    Can it maybe be Hidden Spin Inversion? 
    What other reasons can block healing of the Parathyroid and Pituitary?

    Johan spoke in class about Internal Scar Treatment with Procainum in case
    of Tonsillectomy.
    Sometimes a cliënt had a Tonsillectomy in his eartly years but forgets to
    mention this in therapy.

    In my experience Whiplash treatment on the front side was sometimes needed
    to correct the Parathyroid/Pituitary. Usually this had to do it again the
    next session.... :( 

    Maybe treating the Scar Internally with Procranium will bring a
    solution...... I have tried it today and I can't wait untill the next
    session to see if this was the clue :)

    Johan found in two Parkinson's clients that Diphteria kept coming up on the
    Parathyroid and then cleared that issue by using the Internal Scar
    Treatment (Glass Rods vertically along the Larynx/Trachea) with Procranium.

    Gylfi: 
    Ozaliet (or Montmorrinite) is something you can try to determine whether
    this is -part of- the Cause of your client's problem... If it is the Cause,
    then there should be a source of Radiation or another reason for the Aura
    to be weak. I have also seen certain Drugs or "Spiritual Practices" harm
    the Aura. 
    But this all is just another thing you can try.... if it doesn't match
    you'll have to look further...

    Just to make sure you haven't overlooked something....
    What have you tried already on the Pituitary and Parathyroid? 

    All Vaccinations/Childhood diseases? (especially Variolinum/Varicellen...?)
    All Airborne Toxins? (especially Insecticides, Platinum, Formaldehyde,
    Dioxin...?)

    Ymkje:
    Internal Scar treatment like you suggest definitely can benefit the
    Parathyroid and Thyroid, but it won't correct the Pituitary Gland. 
    So I doubt that the Scars of the Tonsillectomy are causing this man's
    problem (since it is also the Pituitary that keeps dropping)...

    Also if you want to do this kind of frontal Scar Treatment, first correct
    everything with Remedies and then at the end when everything is balanced
    out you can do the Whiplash treatment with both Procranium and the Remedy
    that you measured. Otherwise you'll mask the imbalance that might need a
    Nosode to heal and lose that information. It is very unusual that
    Parathyroid and Pituitary can't be corrected by Remedies.... 
    In Johan's example the Remedy Diphteria was needed, but couldn't solve the
    problem because an Internal Scar was blocking the Energy Flow.... but both
    the Nosode and the Scar Treatment were needed. 

    So to be absolutely clear:
    Johan treated the throat area with the Whiplash Program (Glass Rods) with
    both Diphteria and Procranium in the slots.

    Do you mean if Ozaliet or Montomeronite match, it could be a source of
    Radiation close to the client that causes the problem and holds the client
    back from healing? And then you should look for it and remove the source of
    Radiation? 
    And if it does not match at all you don't have to be worried that the
    client is influenced by Radiation? That would be very helpfull. :)

    I would also try the Heavy Metals and Insecticides, Formaldehyde. I didn't

    Liselotte: What I meant is that when in this case Gylfi measures Ozaliet/
    Montmorronite on the Pituitary and Parathyroid he'll know for sure there's
    something influencing the Aura/Energy, which in turn brings imbalance to
    these glands.In this case you'll have to try to find that source and remove
    it, like you wrote...
    The other way around is not necessarily true... someone can still have a
    sensitivity to EMF/Radiation if Ozaliet/Montmorronite are not measured on
    these Glands, but then you'll know that it is not the Aura/Energy problem
    that is causing the Pituitary and Parathyroid to continuously drop....

    Answers:
    Tried all Toxins => no match.

    Didn't try Heavy Metals on the Hormonal System.... except Platinum.

    I do use Kidney Support when needed, and other Support Remedies when I have
    space for that.  
    I always use the Footplate (Dyslexia) after treatment, usually without
    extra Remedies.

    Yes, I should have tried Psorinum already. I did that today...

    Questions:
    1. Should I treat with the Toxins anyway although I don't measure them?  
    2. Are other Heavy Metals than Platinum sometimes measured on the Hormonal
    System?
    3. Should I use more Support on the Footplates?
   
   
    5th session:

    Measurement:
    Pineal gland
    Sex Glands
    Small Intestines (L)
    Lymphatic System

    Remedies Measured: 
    Ozaliet, Berberis, Campylobacter Pylori, Brucella, Appendicitis, 
    Other Remedies used: 
    Psorinum, Lymphomysot, Populus

    After Hand Treatment => no drops

    Footplate treatment: 
    Schwefheel

    Pituitary and Parathyroid were not dropping this time, but I did measure
    Ozaliet on the Pineal Gland.
    We talked about EMF/Radiation Sensitivity.  We will try one more Session
    next week.   
    4. Can I give him Ozaliet Remedy at home? I was taught that I could copy a
    Remedy in a bottle and then use this in a glass of water to drink. Will
    this work to help him get a stronger Aura?

    reason?

    1. No if you don't measure Toxins you don't have to treat with them.

    2. Every Heavy Metal that comes into the body by breathing can be measured
    on the higher Hormonal Glands. For example: Aluminium (Chemtrails), Plumbum
    (leaded gasoline)...
   
    3. Yes definitely use more Support Remedies on the Footplates, support is
    as important as finding the right Nosodes that address the cause. Organs
    need proper Support in order to heal...

    4. Usually when there is a true lack of Aura more Hormonal Glands than just
    the Pineal will drop, and this time on the left Hand there wasn't even one
    Hormonal drop...  So Aura Strength is probably not the biggest problem,
    there might be a hole in the Aura though since you measured Ozaliet on one
    point. In this case Fringed Violet will match too (this help you to
    identify). You can try to do a Whiplash locally over the head.

    Johan says: Aura problems are always a Symptom, so giving someone Aura
    Support as a supplement is only going to mask the underlying problem....
    Whenever there's a problem like this, there's also a lack of Energy and you
    have to find the Cause of this.
    Anything should be done within the Session and no Supplements should be
    ever given to your Clients. This also applies to Remedies created with the
    Chiren.

    5. Gallbladder Remedies, especially Atropinum

    referring to?  Thanks. 
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    Any drugs that people feel gives them "Spiritual Experiences". The whole
    opening up to astral experiences only happens because of the weakening of
    the Energetic Protection (aura). Often people who are in Spin Inversion all
    the time become/are Hyper Sensitive in any way. When balance is restored,
    the Hyper Sensitivity goes away.

    I have seen it especially with Ayahuasca, Marihuana and Mushrooms. But that
    is because they are the most common drugs I have seen with my Clients. I
    think all drugs give altered states of consciousness, so all have an
    influence on the Soul/Energetics of a person.

    Spiritual Practices often work similar to drugs in that they stimulate
    consciousness to leave the body and focus on altered states of awareness
    and the astral/energetic world. I've actually seen many "spiritual" people
    to be very ungrounded, which weakens the body and harms the aura. Hence the
    susceptibility to energetic influences grows.

    The healthiest mediation for body and aura is "embodied meditation" = body
    awareness, meditation focussed on "being", mindfulness.... etc.

Orthodontic Braces

BiophotonBalance
May 2013 edited January 2014 in Dental Problems/Solutions Flag
Many children wear Orthodontic Braces made of Metal.  

Questions:
1. If I was able to get the items that go into the mouth (brackets, wire, maybe
even the rubber bands), could I make a homeopathic remedy for children to take
daily for as long as they are wearing these items?  

2. How exactly could this be made, in detail.  The braces are often in the
mouth for a few years.  (Also, could a homeopathic remedy be made for plastic
type braces such as Invisiline?)

    Why would you want to make this remedy?

    The biggest problem of braces is probably the metal itself that has the
    ability to act as an antenna or may create electrical currents in the
    mouth, especially when the brace is made of different metal parts that
    don't touch directly or when there are also metal elements in the teeth
    (fillings, implants...). These currents can release heavy metals in the
    mouth too, especially when there are amalgam fillings...

    Also fixating teeth in an unnatural way and putting tension on them has a
    negative influence on the whole body (see tooth maps in your manual).

    When someone clearly experiences problems because of a brace I would just
    advice to take it out. I would rather have crooked teeth (I can show you
    mine ;-)) then deteriorating health... but that's my opinion.

    I agree about the metal in the mouth. I know the antenna issue is a
    concern. 
    And I am not a supporter of braces either as I currently have a jaw issue
    related to the braces I had as a child.

    However...
    Many children have braces with metal. 
    There's a child I am asking this question for. He only has partial braces,
    but any amount of metal would likely cause the antenna issue...

    Symptoms:
    Headaches ==> caused by crowded teeth that prevent the permanent teeth from
    erupting properly.
    Front Teeth erupted in the back of the mouth because of the lack of room...
     
    Braces are needed to prevent him from losing teeth.
    The situation is truly unusual (on scale of 1-10 of difficultly, he is a
    10).  

    I thought perhaps making a remedy would help the body to detox the metal
    daily.

    I would just measure with the Metal Nosodes in the Chiren for this. You
    will see if it is needed by your measurements... But the antenna issue
    won't be fixed by it...

    Sometimes one has to pick between two unhealthy choices.... In this case I
    wouldn't know what to do... maybe making room by extracting a tooth?

Hernias

YelyenaYelyena
February 2013 edited February 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
Woman, 72 years old

History:
Used to have clock next to her bed and her bed is positioned behind TV
Does not recall traumatic (stressful) events/issues 
Mentioned death of her brother
No childhood diseases and no vaccinations

Complaints:
Hernias => Stomach + Lower Abdomen
Digestion => Acid Reflux + Can eat only small amount of food  
Migraines  
High Blood Pressure => coming and going
Osteoporosis 
Poor memory 
Cataract => since last year 
Allergies => sugar and nuts, 
Sleeplessness => with stressful thoughts
Very thin

Supplements and medication taken:
Digestive enzymes, 
Anti-Acid => forgot to mention it during the first session
Blood Pressure medication => every day, even though Blood Pressure is not
always too high
Statins                   

Measurement:
Spin Inversion => reoccurring - discussed positioning of her TV/clock and bed

Triple Warmer - Mumps, Poliomyelitis, Selenium, Berberis, Hormeel (left hand)
Large Intestines - Appendix Point 
Large Intestines - Tuberculinum Bovinum, Podophyllum, Diverticulosis  
Lung - Tuberculinum Bovinum                            
Gallbladder - Billary Cirrhosis, Cholecystitis  
Bladder - Myom Uteri, Lichen     
Stomach - Veratrum, DEN Combi (will check on specific infection later) => she
verified having "problems" with her teeth  
Nervous System - Plumbum Met, Insecticides, Fluoride, Glyoxal                  
                  

Support remedies: 
Atropinum, Spascupreel, Belladonna, Procranium, Mucosa, Nux Vomica, Anacardium,
Circulo, Calm and Clear, Aspen, Mimilus, Agrimony

My questions are:
1. is her Hernias indication of Liver problems and if so, should I wait till
Liver shows itself or ....? 
 
2. Gallbladder problems might be one of the reasons for her "acid reflux"
problem, but since Glyoxal appeared, would it be wise to try Esophageal cancer
remedy. I do not know where I might measure it. Liver does not show itself and
too many reoccurring drops on NS somewhat bother me. I might be missing on
something.

3. Looking back I think I have to pay attention to her TripleWarmer
(Anti-Tetanus?) since she has Osteoporosis but she insisted that she never took
Anti-Tetanus shot.

4. How do I go about her high blood pressure medication? To me her high blood
pressure looks like Gallbladder problem but how do I know if this medication
covers anything up (Kidney?)?  Kidney meridian did not have drops but
Circulation meridian was helped by Aspen/Mimilus.

5. During last session  her left Adrenal Point recovered after Spin Inversion
Program (Is it possible?)

    I hope you did not treat with all the remedies you've mentioned in your
    case… This is far too much. It is important to focus and only use a maximum
    of 8 nosodes and in total 16 remedies.

    Answers:
    1. Hiatal Hernia is a muscle (thus Liver) problem. With the Liver it is
    always best to wait until it shows itself

    2a. The acid reflux is also a structural problem in the case of Hiatal
    Hernia, so treating the Gallbladder might not bring full recovery from the
    acid reflux.

    2b. Esophageal Cancer is also good as a remedy for precancerous conditions
    and Gastric Reflux can cause ulceration that leads to cancer in the long
    run. I would also use the Ulcer remedies for this.
    About measuring Glyoxal I wouldn't be too concerned, it is also indicated
    for pre-cancerous conditions and also benign tumours. 
    It is also dubious if the remedy works at all since it only contains D10
    potency homeopathic remedies, which are ineffective according to Johan's
    experiments. So it is a rudimentary remedy, that might be taken out of the
    Chiren in the future.

    3. Did you measure Whiplash on her?

    4a. The blood pressure medication is something that people should just keep
    taking during treatment, because stopping it can dangerously raise blood
    pressure with severe consequences. Only if the blood pressure is starting
    to come down because of the treatment you can start to cut the dose. 
    High Blood Pressure can be a Gallbladder problem, but also a calcification
    problem of the arteries, Kidneys or Adrenals (potassium/sodium balance -
    too much fluid in the vessels).

    4b. Always try to remedy the meridians with nosodes first, support second
    and flower remedies last, otherwise you'll cover up the physical issue.
    Measuring for example Barijodeel on the Circulation would have shown you
    there was calcification….
   
    5. yes

    Yes, we did whiplash before.

    This week's session:

    Symptoms: 
    cramps in the middle of her belly after eating, 
    no pain in her neck anymore, 
    Remembered now that she "used to have ulcer before" 
    Overall looks to be in a better mood.

    Measurement:
    Liver nail point - Hepatitis A
    Pancreatic Hypoglycema point - Gelsemium
    Galbladder - Carcinoma Hepatis (cleared also insulin point)

    So, I decided to do Carc Hepatis and Gelsemium as support (she has
    migraines) and check Hepatitis A next time
   
    Large Intestines (Appendix point) - Appendicitis is still present
    Lymph (Tonsil point) - Tonsillitis
    Small Intestines (left) - Ulcus Duodeni (couldn't find any food poisoning
    and Small Intestines points on  her right hand were low but not dropping)
    Stomach - Ulcus Ventriculi and I added Oesoph. Cancer (point was very
    stable after)
    Nervous System (one point) - Fibroma Pendulum.
    Circulation (nail pointl) - onlyPlacenta matched
    Veins - Barjodeel/Aurumheel  (support Calcoheel)
    Bladder - Myom Uteri (still needed)
    Kidney - low sound, better with Cantharis 
    Triple Warmer (Thyroid point) - low sound, better with Thyroidea (I thought
    it was more of a digestive issue but Strumeel did not work)

    Questions:

    1. Did I jump too far with Carcinoma Hepatis on Gallbladder (all other
    Gallbladder remedies did not work nearly as well). I think I overlooked
    Zyrrhose Hepatis, it might have worked too.  

    2. Cramps after eating - Gallbladder? But cramps were in the middle of her
    belly (Small Intestines area) is it muscle (Gallbladder/Liver) or lack of
    Magnesium (digestive problem that might make it bioanavailable?)

    3. Small Intestines left - no foodpoisoning found

    February 2013 edited February 2014 Flag
    * Low sounds don't mean biophoton incoherence and don't need remedies.
    There's just a lack of energy and that is caused by other systems. I also
    suspect her Adrenals are still low (hypoglycemia point dropping). When an
    organ has a low sound but no drop I never treat it. You have to focus on
    the systems that do drop to get to the cause. 
    Focussing on too many organs while they don't have a real problem make your
    treatments chaotic. You better direct the bodies energy to the cause.

    * Support should match the nosodes you measure on the organ systems you are
    focussing on.
    Try as support for the ulcers: Erigotheel 

    * The major indication of Gelsemium is problems with the meninges. I don't
    understand why you measure that on the Pancreatic point. I would try
    Selenium or Berberis there.

    * I think the pain in the middle of her belly is probably caused by gas
    (Gallbladder issue). 

    * It is possible to measure Liver nosodes on the Gallbladder.
    You could also have tried Adenomyose Gallenblase, although I don't find
    this remedy frequently. Zirrhose Hepatis is more common.

    I will store for me your very  important message :

    "Low sounds don't mean biophoton incoherence and don't need remedies.

    Answer to Johan's question:
    Selenium and Berberis did not match on the Insulin point, Gelsemium seemed
    to be the only remedy that matched => so I decided to check Gallbladder
    Meridian because I did not understand why nothing else matched.
    Gallbladder meridian => matched Carcinoma Hepatis => also restored Liver
    and Insulin point 
    I decided to give her Gelsemium anyway because she had Migraines.

    Next Session 

    Results after last Session:
    No stiff neck, 
    No shoulder pain, 
    No pains in the middle of belly 
    No headaches either.  

    Not improved:
    Poor Memory 
    Cataract, 
    Feeling of "life being very stressful".  
    Eating => still 5 to 6 times a day, small meals (sugary foods, pastry). 

    Talked  again about trying to eat healthier foods:  
    Suggested Potassium rich, live foods, 1/4 of a glass of vegetable juice a
    day.

    Measurement:
    Spin Inversion => again! She did not have it last session…. => discussed
    her environment again and found out that she has a metal bed with metal
    headboard. 

    >12 Program:
    Triple Warmer  (right) -   Chlorum, Platinum
    Appendix point - Chronic Appendicitis and Appendicitis
    Gallbladder - Adenoma Gallenblase, Zirrhose Hepatis.
    Lymphatic System - Chronic Tonsillitis
    Bladder - Myom Uteri

    Footplate Treatment:
    Cerebrum, Viscum, Thalamus
    Stomach - Erigotheel
    Circulo - Placenta
    Kidney - Berberis
    Selenium
    Ozaliet

    Questions:
    1a. On the Circulation meridian (point1) only Placenta seems to work to
    bring it up. How many times this remedy needs to  be given? (it was two
    times already)? 

    1b. She does have cold hands/feet. What is behind her peripheral
    circulation? 
   
    1c. How many times Barijodeel might be needed (it does not match anymore on
    her Circulation or Veins)?  It is good to know but I do not have experience
    with repeating Barjodeel/Aurumheel remedies.  
   
    1d. Is Placenta needed because of her Cataract, while the Liver will clean
    itself?
    Liver did not show any drops this time.

    2. Ozaliet!  Is there any way to measure it? (Gallbladder meridian?) How
    often can it be given to be beneficial to a body?
     
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    March 2013 edited February 2014 Flag
    Answers:
    1a. The point of the Peripheral Blood Vessels could react to Placenta, but
    this does not really solve the cause.
    If Barijodeel and Aurumheel do not match anymore then try Aesculus but more
    likely Atropinum.
    The bloodvessels can also be cramped.

    1b. Barijodeel and Aurumheel can be used as long as they match. You never
    know how much calcification there is and how fast the body can move it.

    1c. For cold hands and feet you can try Luesinum and Medorrhinum
    symptomatically. But of course the underlying cause (Circulation) needs to
    be addressed too.

    1d. Cataracts are caused by the Stomach (frequently as a result of the
    Gallbladder, but it can also be due to Jaw Problems or Food Poisonings)

    2. You can use Ozaliet every time. Ozaliet can some times be measured if
    there is no Aura at all. If this is the case, all points drop sharply. But
    if there is any aura, you cannot measure it anywhere. But treating with
    Ozaliet is always beneficial.

    My clients love when I use these apps to explain why the Gallbladder is
    responsible for some headaches and the Stomach for the eyes, and especially
    the Bladder for the sinus's.  They really make things clear.  

    I use 3D meridian (apple) and 3D acupuncture , even though some of the
    points aren't the same, you can selectively show a meridian. And it is good
    for pinpointing what meridian they can identify as to where their "pain"
    is.

    Thanks to all who suggested them!

Amalgam and Amin-Fluoride (Teeth)

Karin MeierKarin Meier
November 2014 edited November 2014 in Dental Problems/Solutions Flag
Lots of people have amalgam in their teeth. Is it enough to treat it with
Mercury? Because usually it's a mix of diffrent metals.

And how dangerous is Amin-Fluoride in our toothpaste?

    Mercury in teeth fillings is always a disturbing factor to the body. It can
    continually leech into the body and cause issues. Take a look at the tooth
    meridian chart to see the connection to each tooth and disturbances/
    symptoms in the body. If you are unable to get rid of symptoms a client is
    having through treatments or the symptoms disappear and later reappear, it
    is time to look elsewhere i.e. environment, teeth etc. There are some
    people even though they do have fillings that they respond to treatment and
    their teeth aren't bothering them, although even little symptoms left
    behind that they don't pay attention to anymore because they feel so much
    better than they did before the treatment, may have to do with teeth health
    or other environment re-exposure.

    To get a better understanding on the affect mix metals in the mouth, we
    have this video of Dr. Cook at the International Alternative Medical
    Conference 2013 where it is demonstrated the level of "galvanic" currents
    running in the mouth on various clients by Dr. Cook. It is impressive to
    see how it all adds up where some clients can be running up to 1 volt of
    electric current in the mouth 24/7.

    It does affect the measurements and results. Watch this video to see this
    video of the measurements and the galvanic currents they find in various
    clients' mouth. It really gives you the overall idea the total affect of
    the metal in the mouth has. LINK

    I have found that it does affect the ability of someone being able to
    receive the benefits of sessions from the Chiren. Also I found, that the
    Chiren does give relief to others however short of a time. Read more on
    this at: LINK  & LINK

    For me whenever I am not getting good results with clients, I then double
    check what is in the their mouth and where is it.. ALMOST always it is a
    match to the points that keep dropping.
    It is a matter of educating the client. One person I treated had recurring
    herpes for years.. She had 1 root canal and several mix metal fillings in
    the mouth. After a year of sessions with little results with her herpes,
    she finally went to get the root canal out, and the fillings replaced. Her
    improvement overall was amazing to us both! The herpes breakout totally
    stopped. Its just constant stress on the body all these metals in the
    mouth.. However, small in quantity, they do have an affect over the years.

    Yes, exactly, thank you for expanding Sandra. I believed years ago at the
    time my mother developed ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gerhig's
    Disease here in the US) that it was to do with heavy metals in her body,
    however I knew much less about it many years ago and knew even less on what
    to do about it, knowing that she had all her own teeth, but all were either
    bridges, root canals, caps, etc. etc. As I stated above, some people
    continue to ignore the "little symptoms" because they feel so much better
    overall and they don't mention the little disturbances that continue after
    the initial treatments.

    I eventually got a "medical doctor" to do heavy metal testing on her, which
    he came back with no results and stated her metal levels were all within
    the "normal level". Now I know there is no "normal level"!!!! Anyway,
    Biontology has reinforced my initial thinking on her diagnosis, and looking
    back over the years of the "little symptoms" that were always there that
    she ignored until her immune system couldn't handle everything that was
    going on anymore and she developed that crippling disease which eventually
    took her life.

    When there's amalgam in the mouth it is a continuous source of mercury that
    only stops to poison the body when it is taken out. So treating with
    Mercury will not solve this environmental problem and continuous source of
    stress. It is like we say in the Netherlands "dweilen met de kraan open" or
    translated "mopping up water with the tap open".
    Metal fillings do not only cause metal toxicity but can also form an
    electromagnetic disturbance to the body.

    I usually first treat and see what improvements can be achieved with just
    the Chiren, if then there are ongoing dental issues you will hit a wall.
    The natural next step (when your assessment shows the teeth are indeed the
    problem) is to advise the client to look for a good holistic dentist.
    Because of the previous improvement there will usually be enough trust to
    proceed to the next step. Overwhelming a client with the necessity of
    dental work before even starting to treat or having gained trust will cause
    a lot of unnecessary stress and doubt.

    Amin fluoride is as toxic as fluoride salts. LINK 
    A lot is written about fluoride and the effect on health on the internet.
    As with every toxin some people are more sensitive to it then others.

    Is it right that some people with amalgam fillings have no problem when the
    rest is okay and other do have problems because they have a disease and
    react very sensitive of each disturbance?

Energetix Magnetic Jewellery

Beate
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Other Therapies & Instruments Flag
I met someone who will introduce me to some people.

One of them sells the Energetix jevellery.

I used magnets years ago, but I really do not know....people use a lot at one
time, and I wonder how the energy might get confused in the body?
I definitely do not whant to be negative, but I would not sell it.
I measured a lady yesterday , with the jewellery on. Oh dear....she is not well
.

Question: How deal with this professionally? It is not easy to be alone to
market Chiren here , so I definite need some support ? So it is not very smart
to call her products rubbish, useless and counter healthy...

What is your opinion ? Thanks :)

    It is possible not to comment the items, but that somehow feels a bit

    Hi Beate

    Johan says, that magnets make the body produce endorphins, so you feel
    better but it don't heal the cause.
    When you measure, you get no drops because of the endophins, just nice
    sounds, and then you have difficulties finding the cause!

    I tell my clients not to use magnets in the period,  they are treated with
    the Chiren. And when the Chiren treatment allows  the body to heal, they
    won't have to use them afterwards :)

    Comment to initial Post:

    I understand the dilemma, but I don't like lying... which is the other
    option than telling the truth. 

    But the words you use can make all the difference. You could say that your
    experience is that magnets can cause the body to produce endorphins, which
    will reduce pain and stress and create a feeling of euphoria. So for
    symptom treatment people might like it. But this kind of symptom relief in
    our experience doesn't lead to optimal health.

    If you're going to deal with clients who use these devices, you will
    measure it and will have to address it anyway. So I don't think there's
    anyway around this...

    I think Margit's advice is a good one. You can tell that during the whole

    interference than just that. So temporarily they have to take it of....

    Hi Margit,
    Interesting to hear about your experience. I measured a lady yesterday with
    some magnet jewellery, I guess that were weak ones since drops was showing.

    Anyway I guess there's no way around it, the euphoria part will be most
    difficult to adress, since many people feel down....

    Thank you for all the information on this. 
    I want to share that I have 2 clients whose points were clearing  and their
    conditions were clearing  (one with serious Skin Cancer) however the
    Fatigue they both were feeling was not clearing, and there appeared no
    reason for the Fatigue. One was in Spin Inversion frequently but not
    always.

    I was stumped about the huge Fatigue, and that we could not resolve it,
    until...we went over and over what was in their house and they were both
    sleeping on Nikken (Magnetic) Mattresses, one with a Magnetic Comforter on
    top and one sat in a Bio Mat for a few hours a day!  

    They are not plugged in devices (the Biomat is) but they do adjust ones
    Magnetic Fields. These were not discussed at the outset when we had the
    discussion of what types of things were affecting them in the
    home..Microwaves, Clock Radios by the head, CFL Lights, Modems, Smart

    Hi Jan, very useful info indeed. 
    Everywhere we are bombarded with all kind of Artificial Frequences and
    Devices. In Norway more and more towns has a Wifi all over town, like in
    Trondheim. 
    The Natural Earthfreqence is disturbed. I am worried about all things
    people buy and believe in. So we as Biontologists need to be updated and
    alert. Thank you for sharing this , Jan :)

    Does this advice also apply to wearables for electrosensitivity?
    Specifically, I have been wearing a nova resonator necklace sold by
    EarthCalm. It has provided me much relief of my symptoms due to EMRs in my
    immediate environment.

    Hard to tell for sure of course, as this may be an exception…. but the
    experience is that most energetically charged objects including crystals do
    interfere with our own energy system in a disturbing way. 

    Since I have read in your other posts that you measure yourself in a Spin
    Inversion almost every time, it might be worth trying to take the necklace
    of for a while and see if your aura and energetic strength to withstand
    Spin Inversion improves. Johan and I have observed this countless times
    with clients… Like many aspects of Biontology this does go against popular
    belief, but it is just what experience has shown ;-)

    Hi, in my course of study in oriental medicine I learned that the use of
    magnets are intermittant not constant.  The reason I was given was based on
    the 'life cycle', which in sinusoidal, life energy, Qi (chi) goes in
    cycles, as noted in the time clock of chinese medicine.  So it is said to
    use the magnets when in pain, and remove them when it's relieved.  This
    will increase the blood flow, which is an iron based molecule and result in
    less pain.  It is likened to a pumping effect.  If one keeps the magnet on
    then the blood will eventually accumulate and pain will return.  Of course,
    in chinese medicine, the pain relief is due to the MOVEMENT of Chi, not a
    sedation.  When sedation occurs, chinese medicine sees this in a different
    way.

    The use of magnets increases endorphin production in the body. All effects
    can be explained by this, as endorphins cause pain relief, relaxation of
    muscles/blood vessels and increased blood flow. 
    This is symptom treatment that may have been the only thing necessary in
    olden days, when the cause was still very close to the symptom, but for the
    complex chronic conditions of modern times it will only mask and not solve
    anything. As such I am not a proponent of using magnets.

    Magnets may cause one to feel better but they create a mask under which
    disturbances continue.

Photos on the Footplates

ErikAlterman
March 2014 edited March 2014 in General Questions Flag
Client:
My friend's 10-year-old daughter

Symptoms:
Brain Tumor with accompanying Cysts => discovered by chance about 4-5 years ago

Medical procedures:
She has a drain in her head, so they can drain the cysts if/when needed

Chiren Treatment:
Photo between the Footplates => 2-7 year Program => 3 weeks, once per week

Situation after Chiren Treatments
MRI-scan showed a change in tumor-density =>  the doctor was "ecstatic" 

Questions:
1. Is it ok to continue to run the Photo between the Footplates once per week,
or should I stop until the next medical exam result is available?

2. Could it be useful to use Remedies, or just the Pure Light?

3. What about obtaining a copy of the scanned image (MRI) and putting it on the
Footplates?

    Brain Tumors are almost always Cysts, so I suspect the main Tumour also to
    be a Cyst.

    Answers:
    1. You can keep treating via the Footplates once a week if you want the
    improvement to continue. 
    You did not mention that the Hormonal System has been restored so there is
    no true self healing going on. If you want improvements to be more than
    symptomatically, you'll need to get rid of the underlying cause...

    2. When there's a drain that goes directly outside the body, you can
    correct self healing without danger.
    I would use some Remedies to at least correct the Hormone System and to
    speed up the healing. 

    *You can use the Vaccinations first
    *Then drainage remedies like Hamamelis, Mellilotus, Bariijodeel.
   
    You can also do a Whiplash treatment if you get a photo from her neck.

    If the drain is a Shunt (going from the Brain to the Abdominal Cavity)
    correcting the Hormone function by the use of the Vaccinations might lead
    to the body encapsulating the drain causing extra pressure on the tissues
    and might cause additional problems. 

    3. I do not see any advantage to use a photo of the MRI

    About using pictures between Footplates ... 

    Questions:
    1. Does the photo need to face particular Footplate?
    2. Is Whiplash done directly on the photo of the neck? We place the glass
    rods on the photo or place the photo between foot plates and run scar/
    whiplash program?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    April 2015 Flag
    Answer:
    1. No, it does not matter
    2. You put the rods on the same place on the photo as you would do on the
    client with Whiplash treatment (so not in between the footplates)

Low Stomach Acid

    Hi, no one has brought up the issue of "low stomach acid" causing acid
    reflux.  I think this is an interesting perspective and often the case. 
    When the stomach is low in acid, it shrinks.  The stomach is acid friendly
    and will enlarge when it is present.  The esophagus is not acid friendly,
    and this is where the BURNING occurs.  This is not to say that high stomach
    acid does not exist, of course it does, but this is usually in young
    persons.  When you see older patients, and this is relative (can be 30 or
    60), you can see low stomach acid more frequently.  When the stomach is low
    in acid it shrinks, as said, and this causes the acid to 'pop' into the
    esophagus, which burns.  If you understand this and add in the PPI drugs,
    you can see how the pharmacological strategy is to 'addict' the patient,
    not cure them.  PPI will further lower the stomach acid making the
    esophagus more prone to reflux making the demand for PPI higher. The
    condition is referred to as Hypochlorhydria.
    When the stomach is low in acid the system easily dries up, fails to move
    the fluids: enter Chinese Medicine, if the stomach fails to MOVE DOWNWARD,
    as it is suppose to, then the next phase in digestion - to generate fluids
    - fails and your results will be dry mouth, eyes, skin, etc. often seen in
    aging.  Low stomach acid is a result of aging, stress, poor foods and
    drugs.

    Hi Stephano,

    This is a different topic, since the acid reflux of the client in the
    "Endometriosis" discussion  is caused by a hiatal hernia, which is a
    structural problem. A structural issue like this will usually not be
    resolved by biophoton treatments alone.

    Hypochlorhydria, and digestive issues in general, when caused by a
    functional disturbance, will usually improve due to normal Biontology
    treatment. 

    Hypochlorhydria is often related to exhaustion of the Adrenal Glands, and
    all the measurements to restore their function need to be taken to improve
    stomach acid levels to normal. This means lots of rest and sleep, a regular
    lifestyle, reduction of stress, nutritious food etc.

   
    I came across a simple way to test if there's low stomach acid:
   
    First test:
    * Cook one cup of peeled, chopped Dark RED beets in only water.
    * Eat those beets using NO other food, no other pills or additions.
    * Observe your urine output over the next 24 hours.
    If urine looks to be tinged pink, in any amount, during the 24 hours
    post-eating the water-cooked beets, it means you lack enough stomach acid
    to handle proper digestion.
    If your urine is normal yellow color, you have enough stomach acid, and
    disregard the second test.

    Second test:
    Repeat the test, but add real apple cider vinegar, about 1 to 2
    Tablespoons, to them just before eating them.
    Then monitor the urine output color over the following 24 hours.
    EXPECTATION: urine should now be normal yellow colour.

    Hi Karolina, The structural problem has a history.  it's not uncommon to
    see endometriosis, insulin resistance and low stomach acid and stress as a
    'global view' of the disease pattern.  The decreased stomach acid causes a
    decreased capacity in the stomach and when food enters the stomach it fails
    to digest, increasing the pressure on the diaphragm causing the hernia.  It
    seems to me that this global view gives one the relatedness of things in
    the development of a condition.  This is what whole - ism is to me....Of
    course, the correction of the hernia is a structural concern.  So if you
    can understand the endometriosis, historicallly and a cluster of functional
    issues, I think your Chiren treatment will be better directed.  Taking milk
    or alkaline substance are ameliorating the acid in the esophagus. 
    Further, I think its important to understand that the Stomach is Acid
    friendly and the Esophagus is not, many don't see this clearly. 
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    August 2014 edited August 2014 Flag
    Even though the pathogenesis may be explained this way, it does not help
    the situation when it has become a structural problem. In this case the
    only thing that can be done is lower the stomach acid although this has
    many detrimental consequences of its own. 

    Not everything can be helped by functional healing alone, and this is very
    important to understand in Biontology. The underlying cause of course can
    still be addressed and will be found also in the measurements. But the
    stomach reflux in this case happens not only because of low stomach acid
    causing the sphincter to become weaker, but because of mechanical pressure
    of the diaphragm on the stomach. 

    The reality is that we cannot expect hiatal hernia to be healed by
    Biontology alone. Telling people to get off of their acid reducers is
    torture that will not help, unless there's something done about this
    structural issue.
    I do agree that this condition will lead to more problems in the future
    when antacids are used….

    Endometriosis is a Spin Inversion consequence.

    Hi Karolina, I understand your emphasis on 'healing' the hernia via
    Biontology.  I hope that is not the impression I was giving.  My concern is
    didactic, as yours, so that this condition can best be understood by
    other.  It may even be preventative for some to know that treatment with
    Nexium may, in fact worsen the condition and lead to a hernias in the
    future.  But of course, the Chiren will fix this, preventatively!   

    To know that the conditon is Spin Inversion sheds more light (pardon the
    pun) since even in most alternative methods, endometriosis is difficult to
    treat.  Spin explains this so much more clearly.....

    Years ago when I was seeing an iridologist, she told me that I started
    developing Endometriosis, and we couldn't figure out why. 

    I had my house cleared of EMF's and still it continued, until it suddenly
    came to me in a flash. The EMF expert had sold me a meter to measure for
    dirty electricity so I ran outside and did my experiment. I turned on the
    car, not so bad, I turned on the seat heater: measurement through the roof!
     

    I went out and bought a small sheepskin rug from Ikea and it went away.
    Almost all of my female clients are addicted to them here in Toronto during
    our cold winters and all of them show the need for Ovarium. When they stop
    using the seat heaters, the need for Ovarium goes away. Ikea should thank
    me for their increase in sales! And of course Johan has always promoted
    sheepskin as well.

    Hi Karolina, another possibility to the hiatal hernia/acid scenario is the
    use of herbals, like 'bitters'.  A formular in chinese medicine, Coptis and
    Rehmannia among other possibilities.  What are your thoughts on this?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    September 2014 edited September 2014 Flag
    Herbal extracts have a strong course of action themselves and do interfere
    with the Biontology sessions, just like any other "medication" or
    informational input. Preferably one should first treat the client according
    to protocol without adding anything else to it. Often when everything else
    improves, stomach acid production will improve too. 

    Only when all is balanced at the beginning of a session and there has been
    no improvement of the acid reflux condition during the weeks of treatment I
    would advise things like this. 

    It is all a matter of focussing and not mixing therapies. Herbal bitters in
    themselves can be a great support and I sometimes use them myself when I
    have eaten a very heavy meal with a lot of protein and fat, but I don't use
    them if I am treating myself with the Chiren.

    Well, this question was in reference to the Hiatal Hernia patient, not
    simple stomach reflux.  Since we are apt to use 'something' to try to
    reduce the acid in Hiatal Hernia, the use of herbs would seem to be an
    option since the Chiren does not seem to help in this case.  
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    September 2014 Flag
    I the case of Hiatal Hernia it is certainly not advised to further raise
    stomach acid. Raising stomach acid will not resolve the structural problem
    and only cause more acid reflux.
  •

    September 2014 Flag
    Of course, I agree that is the reason for the herbal question, in my
    experience the herbs work better than milk to reduce the esophogeal acid
    condition.  It's possible though, the herbs might cause a reduction in the
    stomach itself.  So the esophogeal acid burn will be reduced but the
    stomach acid, itself, may be deminished, so using little amount of herbs is
    best....Thanks
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    The herbs work in a healthy body because the increased acidity will close
    the sphincter better, but when a structural problem prevents the sphincter
    from closing the herbs will aggravate the problem… In this case you want to
    lower acidity.

    Maybe it is a language problem. In this context what I meant with "healthy
    body" is when the body is structural in tact. 

    The main thing I wanted to make clear is that it is not a good idea to use
    the herbs in case of hiatal hernia. Not only through theory, but also from
    experience with clients. The increase in stomach acid causes extra
    suffering from the acid reflux. 
  • 
    SVitale
    September 2014 Flag
    But I think here is the 'translation' issue - I am not suggesting nor
    treating for increasing the acid.  The herbs are meant to decrease a hot
    condition so they have been beneficial in using lowering the acid, WHICH is
    causing the burning WHICH is in the esophogus. AND this is in reference to
    the person with the hiatal hernia. I am not saying to give H Cl with the
    hernia.

    The other case of acid reflux without a hernia, the use of Betain H Cl is
    in fact helpful in my clinical experience, since the relative cause is LOW
    stomach acid resulting in ''relux' of the acid into the ESOPHOGUS. 

    So they are two different scenarios but similar with different treatments. 

    Of course when we introduce the Chiren, the use of any herbs that LOWER
    acid is my question.  So I hope the 'thinking' is clear.  I understand from
    your answers, though, the use of any herbs are not desired.
    Thank you

Losing Control of Hind Legs

Hi Karolina Jake, my lab, is also starting to fall a lot...losing control of
his legs.

He was born without hip sockets, but with lots of herbs, swimming and love, he
has doubled his life expectancy! Recently he's started falling....and sometimes
his hind legs cross, his rear end goes down, but he keeps walking, like he
doesn't even realize that the rest of him isn't following.

It breaks my heart.....but he doesn't seem to be in any pain. It's making it
more and more difficult for him to climb stairs. I do whiplash treatments on
him....which he loves. I also do neuro injeel, nervoheel etc. Any other
suggestions? thanks, Christina

    Hi Christina, 
    You can use the Nosodes Brucella Abortus Bang and Brucellosis for paralysis
    in the hind legs. And Botulism also leads to paralysis, so you could use
    that too.

    Remember that the Nosodes are ususally much more potent in healing than the
    Compositae, which are mainly meant as support.

    If he likes the Whiplash, of course keep doing that! Everything to make him
    feel better....

    Hi Karolina
    He's not paralyzed.....he still walks.....it's just that it seems sometimes
    the neuron signals don't go all the way down his spine to his rear
    legs....like it's interrupted somewhere. The vet says this happens with
    aging.

    The other problem is that he was born without hip sockets....hip dysplasia,
    so he has weakness in the muscles there after 14 years. I used to swim him
    a lot when he was younger to develop very strong muscles. He has most of
    his strength in his front legs.
    I periodically treat him with the food poisoning nosodes because I have him
    on a semi-raw diet. Vet wants him on raw foods.....but he won't eat
    it....so I have to saute it a little and leave it raw in the middle!!! He's
    a spoiled, gourmet-loving dog!!
    I'm now confused about treatments since Johan said not to repeat remedies
    you've tried.......I know you can get food poisoning again, so repeating
    those is perfect.....I also feel that the arthritic/calcification remedies
    need more than one treatments so I've been repeating those....and have
    repeated the carcinomas....am I wrong?
    Jake says "thank you Auntie Karolina!"
    xoxo
    Christina

    PS funny note.....he will lie still for the whiplash treatment....will lick
    my arm in appreciation.....but for treatment, if I hold the rods to his
    front feet/legs, he growls at me.....I have to put them on his hind legs/
    feet and he's happy again!! He knows exactly what he needs.

    You have to look for the remedies that have an effect. If they do, of
    course you can repeat them if necessary. All is not black and white. 
    The important thing is realizing that when something doesn't work (which
    means not seeing improvement! even though drops might be corrected...), you
    should try something else and not repeat again and again with the idea that
    when you measure a remedy and you treat it frequently enough that then it 
    will have an effect.... 

    The problem with your dog is that you can't measure.... So you really have
    to go by symptoms. Brucellosis and Brucella Abortus Bang give similar
    symptoms to what your dog has (malfunctioning of hind legs, it doesn't have
    to be full paralysis). According to the similarity principle this could
    work.

    I did not plug the battery pack into the wall when it was plugged into the
    Chiren.
    BUT when the battery pack didn't seem to work anymore I did try to plug the
    Chiren into the wall. It was the cable to recharge the battery pack NOT the
    correct cable. 

    I rarely plug the Chiren into a wall socket because I have concerns about
    the power source there and want to be really careful with the Chiren. On
    one occasion in the past after several sessions the battery died  I tried
    to plug the Chiren into a wall socket. there was a spark and I quickly
    separated the two. It didn't connect. The Chiren wouldn't work. I left it
    alone. The next morning it was OK again. That was maybe a year ago. No
    trouble since BUT my techy son tells me that could be part of the problem
    now. 

    I searched for a Kingston 4GB stick before trying the update, even ordered
    one thru amazon and still got an 8 GB stick (Kingston). Because someone on
    the forum said 8GB worked fine for him I concluded it was OK to try it.
    Otherwise I followed the directions as written in the new manual. Yesterday
    I took my Chiren to another practitioner to try her cable and borrow her
    Chiren that day. The light came on my Chiren, the preliminary start up
    looked OK then it went dark before reaching the log in page and smelt like
    burning plastic...we unplugged it. I can't think of anything more to tell
    you. If you have more specific questions- let me know. What are my options
    now? I think it needs to be serviced. Can anyone do that here in the US?
    How long does this take?

    If the battery dies can I plug it into the wall while using the Chiren? I
    have done this twice in the past and it seemed to work OK.

    Any suggestions/ help is greatly appreciated.

    It looks like your Chiren's circuits burned through because of using the
    wrong adapter. The update plays no part in this. 

    There is no troubleshooting possible, so unfortunately you need to send the

    OK I will send my Chiren to Sylvia who will then get it to Germany. How

    Also is it OK to plug the Chiren to the battery pack (if the battery pack
    dies mid session, which is rare) and then the battery pack recharger cord
    to the wall? This is what I think I should have done in the above scenario.

    At the powertraveller.com website it states it is OK to "daisy chain" i.e.
    charge laptop while battery pack is attached to main (wall) power supply.
    Wouldn't it be the same for the Chiren as long as surge protection is in
    place at the wall?

    With the Power Gorilla it is Ok when you use the surge protector. 
    But with the battery pack that was supplied earlier it should not be done.

    Client:
    30+ son of a dear friend. I booked a flight to head out there leaving here
    on Sunday. 
   
    Medical diagnoses:
    Advanced Lupus, meningitis and esophagitis.  
    Given up by the doctors, who wanted to give him chemo, which he is wise
    enough to refuse.  
   
    Symptoms:
    Terribly frail, I don't even know if he could tolerate the measuring.  
   
    Questions:
    1. Should I do a "preparatory" program first?  
    2. Then, how long should I wait for the next one?  
    3. I would guess a Whiplash program would be needed, right?  
    4. If everything is "down", do I start with Kidneys, so they can handle the
    huge detox, and/Gallbladder, then meningococcum?  
    5. Could I hurt him by doing the wrong thing??  
    I will only be able to be there for 8 days.

    Answers:
    1. No, there is no need.
    2. Just follow protocol => min. of 3 days in between sessions
    3. If you can't measure, Whiplash anyway and possibly Spin Inversion
    4. Just follow the normal protocol, possibly (when you measure them)
    including the Kidneys
    5. If you follow the protocol, there is no need to worry

    In 8 days you can do a maximum of 2 treatments. Then try the following
    remedies on the proximal point of the Nervous System: Bact. Proteus,
    Aluminium, Meningococcen.
   
    Also try Kieferostitis, Granuloma Denti on his Stomach system, especially
    most proximal points.

    Symptoms:
    Nauseated all the time, and can't eat.  
    Everything burns his esophagus.  
    Utterly emaciated, nearly too weak to walk.
   
    Food Intake:
    His mother is giving him broth, water, coconut oil and egg yolk.  That's
    all he can eat.    
   
    Measurement:
    He can't tolerate measuring.
   
    Treatment:
    I did do a Whiplash immediately, 
    Then major kidney supports because his numbers are critically high. 
    I gave him Nux Vomica, but to no avail.

    Results:
    So far, no change.

    If he cannot stand measuring, he definitely has a Spin Inversion

    His symptoms are common for Spin Inversion, also the limited result.

Skipping The Footplate Treatment

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
October 2014 edited October 2014 in Q&A Flag
Question:
Sometimes there is not enough time for a whole session. Than I try to find the
most important nosodes (about 3-5) and the most important support remedies
(about 3-5) and put them together in the session with the glass rods and skip
the dyslexia footplate session. People seem to really benefit from those
shorter and more focussed sessions as well. What do think about that?

Answer by Johan:
This is how I treated when I first started out. There is no real problem with
it when you don’t find enough time. But the session will be at least 2 times
less effective this way. Also the chance on side effects is bigger.
I accidentally discovered that the dyslexia program, which I was at one point
only using for dyslexia, made the overall session at least 2 times more
effective in that I needed fewer sessions for someone to be free of their
issues and with fewer side effects.

    I found this out the hard way twice when I treated myself and didn't have
    enough time. When I only used the hand rod treatment and not the dyslexia,
    I got a terrible headache (which I never suffer from) and very tired and
    fatigued the next day. I thought it was only a coincidence, but not after
    the second time.

    I will NEVER do this again, but instead wait until I DO have time for the
    dyslexia program, as I never feel anything but energetic after a treatment
    then. And I certainly won't put a client through that either.

    I was told that children under 12 should only get the hand rods, but I
    think the reason for that was that most of the time the child can't sit
    still long enough for the Dyslexia program. 

    Questions:
    1. I figure if a child will sit still for the duration of the Dyslexia
    program, and I choose to give her this, the child will get better quicker
    as is the case with adults. Can I go ahead and treat her with the Foot
    Plates or is there another reason for a child under 12 not to get that
    treatment? 

    2. Would the Dyslexia program maybe too much for a child under 12 because
    it allows the light to enter unfiltered and for a long time?

    One of the most significant impressions Johan has left on me is that
    Biontology is not a recipe driven system. It is an exploration driven
    system. 

    Test the points, listen and observe which point(s) drop and explore/find
    which remedy strengthens the dropped signal to produce a tone that no
    longer drops. Then you have the correct remedy match for that particular
    point at this moment in time. At another time that same point may drop and
    require a different remedy.
   
    When you look at illustrations of the Meridians you will see that the
    Hormone System Meridian and Gallbladder Meridian involve the ear. So you
    can check remedies for those meridians as well.

    Also I would like to make another suggestion. From my own personal
    experience, this can also be an infection on the meridian of the inner ear
    which can be from a jaw cavitation/infection. 
    You can also check the points for jaw cavitation as this runs over the
    inner ear meridian as well.
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel

    Megan: The idea that balance problems are caused by an inner ear issue is
    not necessarily true, even though this is the conventional medical
    diagnosis.
   
    Sandra: I have no idea what you mean by "meridian of the inner ear". In our
    system anyway this meridian does not exist by this name. However, you are
    right in that jaw problems can cause balance problems.

    Possible causes of balance problems are:
    1. Inner ear problems - this you find on the Lymphatic System meridian
    2. Bladder issues (causing weak knees and sinus inflammation that can
    spread into the ears)
    3. Gallbladder disturbances (goes around the ears and also affects the hips
    = stability)
    4. Jaw issues - this you can find on the most proximal points on the
    stomach meridian.

    Truly, I should say that it was on the meridian of the lymph system that
    was dropping and it was the infection in the jaw (wisdom tooth area) that
    was causing this and thus the cause of my vertigo.  Once the infection in
    the jaw was cleaned up, there was no more dropping on the lymphatic system
    and all of this happened within the very hour of the treatment. It was
    something I had for many months, went to many different doctors,
    acupuncture, nothing. It was finally after going to my Uncle who has
    treated many cases of vertigo this way and I was simply amazed how he knew
    this. AND I remember the first thing he did was to measure my Lymphatic
    meridian.

    February 2015 edited February 2015 Flag
    Most infections of the mucosal areas in the head can show up on the Lymph
    meridian, so also dental infections. But the specific points for jaw/dental
    assessment are the most proximal points on the Stomach meridian.

Order of Measurement

    I have some questions about remedy testing following meassurement protocol.
    In this case they are about the first treatment(s)

    Questions:
    1. After Circulation, do the Veins also need to be completely clear before
    proceeding to the Intestines?

    2. When Adrenals and Insulin points on the left drop, do we first check
    Gallbladder remedies on these points or is it more logic then to first try
    Selenium and Berberis on the Adrenals and see if this also clears Insulin
    points?

    3. When the Appendix point drops, do we try the remedies for this after
    clearing Triple Warmer, Kidney, Circulation/Veins with other remedies? Or
    do we put it in sooner, since an Appendicitis can give many drops on all
    organs.

    Specially when the Appendix point drops, which happens a lot. I'm not
    completely sure when to start putting it in and it's twin the Tonsillitis
    after that.
  •

    Answers:
    1. No. When your insight grows and you are able to find the connections
    between different organ systems, you will find that the Nosodes needed to
    treat a "Causal organ system" (= the organ system where the cause of
    another disturbance lies) restores balance in the Organ System that was
    affected. 
    For example, you might find that when you see the Gallbladder drop, putting
    a matching Gallbladder Nosode in a slot will correct points on Circulation
    and Veins too. (mind that this is just an example...)
    It is important to realise that when a Gallbladder remedy corrects the
    Circulation/Veins, your focus was still to get these systems in order
    first, and not the Gallbladder... The right order of treating Organ Systems
    is very important.

    2. Gallbladder remedies, when they match on the Triple Warmer, match only
    on the right hand (Insulin low). Usually Selenium and Berberis will correct
    the Adrenals and at the same time the drops on the Insulin point on the
    left hand.
    On another note, weakness in the Adrenals over time will lead to
    Gallbladder problems. This is where the term "Gallbladder Energy", that is
    often used in the training, comes from. When the Adrenals lack to supply
    the energy to the body that is needed to function, the Gallbladder takes
    over with "false energy". So Adrenal problems are often the Cause of
    Gallbladder problems, and the order that makes most sense is to treat the
    Adrenals first.

    3. The Hormonal System is always the first... Vaccinations, Adrenal
    Remedies, Toxins... 
    There is the very rare possibility of the Pituitary not being corrected
    with the usual remedies. Then you can try (acute) Appendicitis on the
    Hormonal system. (exception!) 

    After the Hormonal System is corrected (but also before...), the whole
    picture of measurement should be taken into account.
    When many points drops including Intestinal points, it is wise to
    immediately try to see whether the different stages of Appendicitis and/or
    Tonsillitis match, because when they really are needed this will balance 
    many Organ Systems.
    The measurement protocol is a help to focus on the different Organ Systems
    in the right order and to get an understanding of what remedies are most
    frequently found.

    However in Biontology we make use of Synthesis Thinking, which is very
    complex to explain.... it is not linear and takes all Organ Systems into
    account. For example:

    How they influence each other according to the five element teaching, 
    What the physical function/structure of the organs is and how this can have
    consequences (for example, you don't want to put the body under a lot of
    detox-stress, which might raise blood pressure, when the Veins/Arteries are
    calcified and/or weak), 
    How psychology influences the organs and how the organs influence
    psychology, 
    How E-meopathy works and how we can use the remedies in the Chiren most
    effectively, 
    How symptoms that are apparently unconnected are connected by a similar
    cause..... 
    And many more factors....

    The more knowledgeable, flexible and experienced you get in Biontology the
    better the Synthesis Thinking, which is a kind of Intuition with a solid
    fundament, will get.
    It is about gaining insight about many aspects of our human functioning and
    integrating them to find the imbalance that is most Causal... (there will
    always be a Cause before a Cause, but you can only see as far as you can
    see, and we don't have to go as far as to understand the "Universal First
    Cause" to restore someones self-healing ability ;-))

    Question:
    (1) I don't understand the question about treating the Large Intestine when
    one hasn't measured all the organs yet.
   
    My understanding of the Measurement Protocol is: 
   
    1. First test the proximal points of the Triple Warmer, Heart, and
    Circulation on the left hand to detect Spin Inversion, 
    2. Only stop measuring IF the client does need the Spin Inversion
    program...do that first, and then continue to measure ALL the photon
    highway points for 'drops' ... 
    3. Not to give any remedies (nosodes) for the standard treatment for drops
    until one has completed measuring all of the points? 
    4. And if there is a Whiplash, to treat that only after one has measured
    everything. 
    5. Once the Spin Inversion and Whiplash are corrected (if needed) as
    described - then all the vaccines, etc. are put in the slots for 2-7.. 
    6. Once all this has been done, we measure to see how many drops
    disappeared. 
    7. Then we start finding remedies (nosodes) for the drops that didn't go
    away for the actual 10-minute Standard program. 
   
    Question:
    (2) Am I correct? Or?

    Answers:
    (1) In my understanding Joelle asked how to proceed with the measurement
    protocol after having measured everything without remedies, then finding
    remedies for the Triple Warmer and Circulation....  The question is: But
    what after that...? Should every Meridian be approach strictly step by
    step... The answers to that question I have tried to give in the above
    posting.

    (2) See following comments:

    Point 1 = correct
    Point 2 = correct
    point 3 = correct
    point 4 = correct
    point 5 = this is a mistake, here you need to measure and test for remedies
    (mainly nosodes). When you have found the remedies that correct the systems
    you need to work on first according to the protocol, you run the >12 year
    program for adults or the 2-7 years program for children with these
    remedies. You should never put in all the vaccinations in a short (2-7
    year) program before running the standard >12 years program.
    point 6 = correct
    point 7 = not correct. After the hand treatment the Foot Plate program is
    used. Protocol is 1 Standard Hand Treatment + 1 Foot Plate Treatment.

    Sorry Karolina, but I am confused about Points 5 and 7.  I have always run
    the Footplates after the Standard treatment (never anything else in
    between). So, if I am not supposed to do the Vaccines before the hand
    treatment, and do the footplates after the hand treatment - WHEN do I run
    the Vaccines? Somehow, I am missing what you are saying here. So sorry...

    Maybe I am not being clear. Extremely tired the last couple of days
    (construction in reception area outside my office with noise and
    dust...aagh!)... To be more clear. I always do the Spin first, if needed.
    Then I continue to measure all the points, and if I find a whiplash, I run
    that after I have measured the hands and feet. It is after all of this that
    I have been running the most common vaccines, and then I return to measure
    the points that were dropping and test and match for nosodes for the
    10-minute Standard Treatment. After that it's the Footplates with all the
    Supports. Where would you put the Vaccines in this picture?

    Hello, Kathryn
    I understand you are talking about first session or first couple of
    sessions:
    1. after whiplash, spin inversion and measuring (again!) all points on
    hands and feet,
    2.  go back to TW and measure what vaccines/remedies recover TW points,
    3. after recovering TW points on both hands decide what to do next
    depending on the whole picture (to fill empty slots), usually it is Food
    poisoning and App. or Kidney (again, depending on the whole picture)
    after decision if made and 8 slots are filled run 10 minute program (12
    y.o. program)
    4. measure again
    5 .fill 8 slots with support for vaccination/nosodes depending on the
    problem you see and run 16 minute Dyslexia program
    6. Measure Kidney and Circulation meridians and address problem with 1 or 2
    remedies only if it is necessary - run 2-7 program (2 minutes).
    all done!

    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    To be absolutely clear about this:

    The Vaccinations/Childhood Diseases should be measured, just like all the
    other Nosodes. They should not be ran as a recipe... and especially not
    before you are going to run 8 other Nosodes too (this makes 16 Nosodes!).
    The Vaccinations/Childhood Diseases that are measured become part of the >
    12 yrs. Program.

    We never use recipe's in Biontology, only when there's no way of measuring
    like with the Chikey cards, but this will slow down the process immensely.

    The only thing you should really be aware of is that Anti-Tetanus and
    Poliomyelitis will always show up in a first session unless there is some
    suppression. 


    As for point 6 of Yelyena's posting I want to add that it is very rare that
    you would need the extra 2-7 program. It is only meant as a safety measure
    for times when the Kidneys or Triple Warmer are not right yet.

    One remark on my question 3:

    Does your answer mean that the Appendicitis remedies can never correct
    points on the Hormonal System. Or they can but they are not used to correct
    the Hormonal System because they are not Causal?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    Hi Joelle,

    I do not exactly understand where the question comes from… This is what I
    wrote:

    "The Hormonal System is always the first... Vaccinations, Adrenal Remedies,
    Toxins...
    There is the very rare possibility of the Pituitary not being corrected
    with the usual remedies. Then you can try (acute) Appendicitis on the
    Hormonal system. (exception!)" 

    "When many points drops including Intestinal points, it is wise to
    immediately try to see whether the different stages of Appendicitis and/or
    Tonsillitis match, because when they really are needed this will balance
    many Organ Systems."

    So what I actually try to say here is that there IS a possibility that the
    most common remedies don't match and that there CAN be a picture where
    Appendicitis is causal of the Hormonal imbalance… I just was urged by Johan
    to write that this is rare, because our experience is that when something
    is written down, people might pick it up and think this is very common, 
    thus forgetting the most common suspects (most frequently the first options
    in measurement protocol will match!). 
    So keep in mind that Appendicitis on the Hormone System is possible, but
    not common.

    Appendicitis is a remedy that is often very Causal in many issues.

    I hope I'm more clear now…

    Did you measure yourself? You may want to see what other organs are weak so

    Lime like in limestone? So calcium carbonate?

    Calcium is not a blood clot. Does she have blood clots? 
    When she has, her fear is not unreasonable, because a clot can always come
    loose and then you should be very, very careful in your treatment. It is
    not advised to treat under these circumstances, because you'll have to be
    fully aware of all circumstances. Since Sythesis Thinking is still not
    mastered by most therapist, I usually advise against it.

    However, when this woman's stroke was caused by Calcium build up and there
    is no reason to suspect blood clotting, you can treat her without
    problems. 

    Aurumheel and Barijodeel will help to desolve the Calcium deposits.

    Thank you for answering. this woman has blood clots so I am not going to
    treat her. I was also afraid that a blood clot was coming loose and I don't
    know wich way he goes.

    Questions:
    1. Does your response, Johan, mean that people on blood thinners who have
    had a stroke should not be treated?

    2. Are there remedies in the Chiren to help "thin" the blood? 

    3. Lyme patients are given supplements to break up the biofilm and thick
    blood supposedly caused by die off.
    Will the light treatment process cause the blood to be thicker in the same
    way the supplements and antibiotic die off causes thicken blood, and hence
    possible stroke??

    4. I have been using Aesculus, do you suggest other remedies?

    One has to be very careful with people who have a blood cloth in their legs
    for example. If that moves it could get in their Lungs and they could die.
    But when the damage has been done (the blood cloth has already moved and
    caused a stroke for example) then you cannot do wrong anymore because they
    already got blood thinners from the doctor. The only thing to do now is to
    remove the Calcification.

    Answers:
    1. When people are on blood thinners, there's no danger in treating.

    2. Blood cloths are often formed because of Calcified Arteries that prevent
    the blood from moving (stagnant blood).
    People who have had a stroke always have Calcified Arteries, so this is
    what has to be treated and not the blood itself.
   
    Thick blood is caused by a lack of fluids or relatively too many
    thrombocytes (blood platelets).
    Control of the production of thrombocytes lies with the Gallbladder system,
    so the Gallbladder must be treated and the people should increase their
    intake of water. 
   
    3. The biophoton treatments do not cause thicker blood. I have done many
    tests in the past on the effect on biophoton treatment on blood work, and I
    have never seen blood getting thicker. 
    The only way I can think of that the biophoton treatment could be
    responsible for thickening of the blood is if there was suppression of
    platelet production and that because of the suppression being lifted the
    symptoms might get worse.

    If biofilm and other discards stay in the blood, then there is something
    really wrong. Normally the blood does not function as a garbage carrier.
    The blood will dump anything as soon as it can.
    If the blood does not do that then either there are no more dumping spots
    or the toxins or there is something wrong with the Blood Vessels or the
    Lymphatic System.

    4. Remedies that can help blood cloths are things like Arnica and Aesculus.
    But your main focus should still be on the increase of fluid intake and the
    reduction of the constriction/narrowing of the Blood Vessels.

    I have a 58 year old woman with a 30 year history of blood clots inquiring
    about Biontology treatments.  I read this post and I want to be certain
    that it is safe to treat a person with blood clots who is on blood
    thinners.  This particular woman has been on blood thinners for some time.
     She is currently on bed rest with another new clot in her leg.  Is it safe
    for for her to receive treatments?

    If she still has blood clots in despite of her blood thinners, I advise
    against treatment.

Child with Type 1 Diabetes

slevarekslevarek
April 2014 edited April 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Clients:
Mother = 55 years old, naturopathic Chiropractor - mother of 4 children
Son = 5 years old, a twin boy name

Boy's symptoms:
Extremely intelligent => can do math, can write and read full articles(his twin
sister does none of this as yet) 
He is very connected to his mother => the mother is very stressed.. and I am
wondering if the child is picking this up

History:
Delivered via Cesarean
He has only been on raw vegan diet from birth
Never has had a vaccine in his life
Takes a lot of vitamins and other remedies 

Diagnoses:
Type 1 diabetes =>  parents are so surprised at this diagnosis and are doing
everything possible naturally for the boy.

Possible cause suggested by parents (both naturopathic doctors):
* He used to be in a bedroom right by the WIFI router => he now wears different
WIFI protection in his pockets, and around his neck. 
* The mother is wondering if anything from her could have passed through to the
child? (since he never had a shot)
* The mother wants me to (next session) test for Coxsackie A9 as she read this
could be the cause.. as well as Variolinum which could be passed from mother to
child. 
* She also says that she has read where parasites could be the cause. 

Measurement:
I measured Spin Inversion => gave Whiplash treatment => still measured Spin
Inversion => gave Spin Inversion treatment => Spin corrected

Only the Pancreas was dropping => Plumbum matched (also tested Insecticides and
other toxins)

Thoughts:
* I measured Plumbum on his Pancreas. My thinking was raw vegan his entire
life, maybe there was lead from the soil

Hand Treatment 2-7 years:
Plumbum, Atropinum, Ozaliet


Feedback:
After months of doing well, yesterday his blood glucose was off the charts and
it had not been like that for 6 weeks. They had him mostly off insulin and
yesterday he had to have 3 shots. 
They monitor him very closely. 

Advise:
I tested all supplements => almost half of them did not support his system, so
we agreed to not have him take them till next visit 

Questions:

1. Could the WIFI protection affect him adversely??  

2. What am I looking for besides drops on the Pancreas since I can not find any
other drops all over? I have to be honest, I am not sure what I am looking for
in a child who appears so healthy to me and all points show correctly after I
corrected the Spin.

3. Could the rise in blood sugar be from my session with him?? I am suppose to
see them again tomorrow.. 

4. The mother suggested Coxsackie A9 and Variolinum. Is this wise to treat even
though they never gave a vaccine to him in his life? 

Any advice is welcomed. Maybe tomorrow’s session things will show differently.

    Hi Sandra,

    A Vegan diet (which excludes all animal products including dairy) since
    birth means that the child has never had any milk. Did you mean a raw
    Vegetarian diet instead?

    Did the child ever drink cow’s milk? The protein in cow’s milk is similar
    to the insulin molecule and has been linked to type I diabetes in children.
    If the child has leaky gut then the cow protein molecules are not digested
    and go directly into the bloodstream. The cow protein molecule is attacked
    as a foreign invader. Because that molecule is similar to the insulin
    molecule, the pancreas cells that make insulin are also attacked and
    killed.

    With type II diabetes the pancreases is still functioning. In type I
    diabetes the islet of Langerhans cells that create insulin are destroyed. 
    To my knowledge there is no way to resurrect them once they are completely
    dead.  Hopefully this child does not have type I diabetes, in the true
    sense, and there are some live cells remaining that just need to be
    rejuvenated.

    Is there some reason they can't use an Ethernet cable or turn off the
    wireless router at night? I’ve looked into some of the wireless protective
    devices and have never found any with actual research to substantiate their
    claims. They often use the word “Proprietary” to get around providing
    useful information. If you find any company that actually offers credible
    data, please share it.

    Yes no animal products, no dairy.. raw foods only. 

    Oh the are so aware of the internet cables now.. all of it off.. They are
    just baffled with this child having been diagnoses as such.. 
    I have to add.. there is stress in the house.. The mother is really
    stressed. The relationship between the husband and wife is stressed.. I
    wonder if the child is picking this up 

    They have the entire house wireless protected..

    Answers:
    1. The WIFI protection he is wearing might create the Spin Inversion
   
    2. A lack of drops combined with symptoms can mean Endorphins. 

    Lead and other metals could affect the physical pancreas, but not the
    insulin. 

    Stress is a primary cause for Diabetes 1. It might come through his mother,
    there might be competition with his sister, but don't forget that
    starvation (lack of nutrients from food, not supplements) can also cause
    stress and endorphin production. 

    3. The rise in blood sugar was most likely caused by the removal of the
    suppression, that the Chiren does automatically. Plumbum and Atropinum also
    specifically help lift the Endorphin mask. Probably you will find more
    drops tomorrow.

    4. Treating has nothing to do with having had or not having had
    vaccinations. When you measure these nosodes you can just use them. 
    Nosodes of childhood diseases can sometimes still be measured when a client
    has not been vaccinated, so try to be objective and don't follow the
    assumption you won't need them. Vaccinations of children in the boy's
    class, or the actual diseases going around could have affected him too.

    5. Measurement of supplements does not tell you much, since they are
    different before than after digestion. Supplements also could cause stress
    in the body and can definitely cause many digestive problems. I would
    advise to stop them all during treatment.

    "The relationship between the husband and wife is stressed"

    Children are extremely sensitive to stress from their parents… so I think
    this is an issue that definitely needs attention.

    "The mother suggested Coxsackie A9 and Variolinum"
    In my research of the nosodes it is Coxsackie B4, Rubella and Mumps, that
    have a specific correlation with Diabetes 1, but of course there are many
    possible other causes.
   
    When I read your case I agree that family-stress can very well be the
    underlying cause. The personality/identity of small children is not very
    well developed, which makes that there is no separation between what they
    feel and what their parents feel…. if then there's nobody to tell them what
    is going on, and that the parents are actually having these feelings, the
    inner tension can become part of the child's identity. 

    Example from my personal life:
    - My father is bedridden and terminal
    - My brother has a hard time dealing with the fact he is going to lose his
    father
    - My brother's little girl (4 1/2 years old) recently had an attack of
    aggression and anxiety at school
    - When they calmed her down a little bit and asked her what was the matter
    she said: "I'm afraid you are going to leave me papa!"
    - Then my brother told her about his fear of losing his father (in simple
    child-language of course) => after that everything was fine!
    For me this is a beautiful example of how children are perfect mirrors.

    I really think the parents of this boy you are treating should take the
    responsibility to work on their issues. Also, I do hope they don't use the
    child's problems as a distraction from their own problems, which would make
    things even worse.

    I need some advice here.. 

    Treatment:
    The boy had only 3 sessions => using only support remedies with the >7
    program. 
    There were no drops for vaccines
    I used support remedies for the pancreas
    But mostly it was his Spin Inversion I had to work with as he was alway in
    a Spin Inversion when he came to me. 

    Question:
    Can the sessions I did cause this result in his blood sugar drops? 

    The mother, on the other hand, was and is emotional.. stressed to the max.
    We did talk about what you wrote to me Karolina, she gets it. But I just
    can't figure out what or how to treat the child, as I do not see so many
    drops.. He appears to be healthy. I feel pretty inept with this one..
    Thanks for your feedback


    "Hi Sandra-

    I have been thinking of you, as well.

    Chaveyo is doing pretty bad with high blood sugars. Literally, since a day
    or 2 after he first saw you, and that has been a month. At first I hoped it
    was a healing response. But now, as I look back at my records, I see he was
    doing great for 6 weeks, and then went bad and never recovered, but is
    actually getting worse. I'm not blaming the Chiren, as there are so many
    other factors. I was hoping he would rebound, though.

    On June 11 I am taking him to a homeopath that works on a profound
    spiritual level, that studied with Vega Rosenthal. I just feel like there
    was an assault he did not recover from.

    I considered asking you, again, if you think Johann would assess him
    through a photo, or something.

    We are all pretty exhausted, but do believe in the body's ability to heal,
    and are trying our best to access the deepest level we can. (Now why did I
    give him a name that means spiritual warrior? Ha..Ha. His second choice
    name was Palladin, which is also a warrior...so either way, I guess this is
    his karma- for now...but not forever)

    OK- the best-"

    The first thing to begin with is the protocol because there are many
    disturbances that are removed by that alone that may be causing these
    symptoms. I have had symptoms of depression and suicidal thoughts reduced
    to almost gone in one treatment.

    With high blood pressure you must get rid of calcification (if there is
    any) after restoring the parathyroid, and then increase speed of the
    circulation, support and strengthen veins, circulation, kidneys and
    adrenals (making sure they are aware to balance their lifestyle/stress
    level. I have had all but one person (because she had fear to let go of the
    mediation and no trust) go off their high blood pressure medications with
    excellent results, however, if they are not willing to reduce the stress
    level in their life, they will sometimes again show signs of it being high
    at certain times, at which time you must talk to them and tell them why and
    if they are willing to let go of things and listen to the body's signal to
    rest.

    The combination of high blood pressure and stomach problems points toward
    Gallbladder issues. 

    Schizophrenia in TCM is said to be an excess of both Wood and Fire
    elements. This can be caused by a relative weakness in the Metal element.

    Explanation: 
    When Metal is weak Fire will overact on it due to relative excess and Wood
    will also show relative excess due to a lack of control by Metal. So an
    excessive pattern in both these elements can very well be caused by a
    weakness in the Large Intestine or Lungs… LINK

    I have personally never treated someone with Schizophrenia and am very
    interested in what you find Karin. Please keep us updated.

    Hi Karin,

    I created an oversight of the information you have given in you post (you
    can make corrections if I made mistakes), but it is very incomplete. We
    need information about ALL the points or meridians that were dropping, and
    also all the treatments and remedies you used. 

    There are however several things that I can comment on. I know you are
    still a student, so I wonder if you have received the new manual in your
    training. The protocols that are described in the Biontology Manual are
    crucial for optimal results and to prevent unwanted reactions of the body. 

    Some pointers:
    * It is very important that you focus on the first layers first and that
    the exit channels are cleared before you start treating with Heavy Metals
    and Toxins. People can get severe reactions, especially depending on the
    condition of their Kidneys.

    * Never treat for Toxins or Heavy Metals before the Kidneys are corrected
    (And that does not mean corrected during the session, but at the beginning
    of the session!). This is the number one complaint we receive from clients
    who have been treated the wrong way by practitioners, and we cannot warn
    enough about this. The Kidney system is very delicate and you do not want
    to damage it.

    * Everything should mainly go by measurement except for when the meridians
    of focus are cleared and you choose your supports, or when the measurements
    conflict with the situation of the client (and are thus unreliable). So it
    is not the right way to "treat all vaccinations", or "treat the heavy
    metals and toxins". The only vaccinations that you should standard use in
    the first session (IF the client is vaccinated for them) are Anti-Tetanus
    and Poliomyelitis. But it is very uncommon for them not to show up anyway.
    It is also very uncommon to need more than 3 or 4 vaccinations the first
    session. Some vaccinations may even never show up and are not necessary to
    treat.

    * If the systems that you mentioned were the only ones to drop, this is
    very unlikely, and there must be a measurement problem (see manual).

    * The fever and sore throat were likely to be unnecessary reaction of the
    body. This may happen when a Chronic Tonsillitis or Appendicitis are
    overlooked the first session. Chronic inflammation can become acute once
    the immune system starts working again. But you should have been able to
    measure them.

    * Tremors are caused by either calcification or the Gallbladder system. So
    your first focus should be on the Parathyroid, since it is still not
    corrected in the 9th session, and then see if Barijodeel or Aurumheel match
    on the Circulatory System.
    But considering all the other symptoms your client has, he also has a
    Gallbladder problem.

    * You mention about the Helper's Hole: "I always measured it, but it didn't
    show until now". What is the difference between "measuring" and "showing
    up"? For me this means the same. 

    * Helper's Hole means that the proximal points on the Large Intestine and
    Small Intestine both: 
    1. drop sharply
    2. are not corrected by any other remedy than Fringed Violet.
    Point 2 is very unlikely, usually the points clear when nosodes of
    intestinal infections or Appendicitis (any stage) are measured.

    * If there was a Whiplash, the Parathyroid keeps droping, there are Kidney
    Stones like your case-report shows. This means that there in fact a long
    standing problem with the calcium metabolism, which should also show in the
    Circulatory system.

    * Skin problems are often of a circulatory nature, but can also be caused
    by a bad Kidneys. Maybe he has both.

    * The very first thing, before you start to do anything else is to focus on
    the Hormone System (and if necessary the Kidneys). By the 9th session the
    Hormone system should be in a good condition energetically unless a cause
    is not addressed.

    Some additional comments:
    Schizophrenia is a case of extremes. Whenever there are extremes, the
    Gallbladder system is the cause.

    High blood pressure can be caused by calcification of the blood vessels,
    but is more often caused by the cramped condition of the vessels. This
    cramped condition is also caused by the Gallbladder system. Another reason
    for high blood pressure can be the Kidneys.

    If the Hormone System is still bad after so many sessions, you must have
    overlooked something, something crucial. Since you have not given all your
    measurements and what remedies you used, it is difficult to say what you
    might have overlooked.

    Thank you very much for your comments.
    I'm sorry that I didn't give you all informations you need.
    In the meantime I saw him again. 
   
    Most recent session:
   
    Hormone System (bad points Pituitary and Parathyroid) => Poliomyelitis,
    Variolinum, Varicellen, Anit-Tetanus, Serum Ovile and Chronic Tonsillits 
   
    Kidneys => Calculi Bil

    Circulation (Cerebral + Coronary Arteries) => Barijodeel, Aurumheel,
    Aesculus, Injeel Chol, Atropinum, Selenium and Apis. 
   
    In this treatment before, the Hormone System was okay. 

    Questions:
    Could it be that there is a scar I didn't know and I should treat? All
    scars I know I have treated. 

    A Spin-Inversion I also did once before with him because I thought he could
    have an Endorphine Mask.

    Next time when I see him I will measure all the points. I will tell you
    them and the remedies I used.

    If again the Hormonal points are bad, and you have already treated with the
    vaccines, there is normally no need to use them again. Then you should look
    for other Toxins.

    If the Parathyroid still drops, there is not much use in treating the
    Circulation for Arteriosclerosis since the Calcium metabolism still does
    not work (although Barijodeel has some other effects too). 

    An endorphin mask should be tried to solved with measuring with Plumbum,
    Atropinum and/or Viscum. 
    Sometimes the Spin Inversion also is a successful way of lowering
    endorphins, but it is important to understand that this does not imply that
    in fact there was Spin Inversion. 

    When endorphins mask the Spin Inversion points (in case of Spin Inversion),
    this causes what we call "Hidden Spin Inversion". In this situation Spin
    Inversion treatment is indicated. But not all drops are suppressed by
    endorphins with Hidden Spin Inversion. The suppressed drops are mainly on
    the specific points that are stressed by the Spin Inversion itself.

    Selenium, Rubella, Vaccinium, Atropinum, Injeel Chol, Hepatitis A,
    Ubichinon, Sutoxol
    And I treated him with them.

    It was very difficult for me, what I should treat. I know that after Scars,
    Endorphine Mask, Spin-Inversion , Whiplash, Helper's, Scars, Endorphine
    Mask you should treat the Hormone System. But once the Hormone System seems
    to be okay and now it isn't. And this time a lot of things end up by the
    liver when I look in my sheets. So I tried to treat that also.

    What do you think about?

    The Liver should never be treated when the first layer (Hormone System)
    hasn't been corrected yet. You need to focus and take care to treat in the
    right order (all is described in the manual).

Diabetes

m3pollack
October 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
16 yrs old girl with diabetes brought in by her mother.

Symptoms:
Depression
Sleeps up to 20 hours a day and is too tired to go to school most of the week. 

History:
Diabetes => diagnosed when she was 9
MRSA infection => contracted in the hospital

Medical interventions and medication:
Nearly every vaccination available (except malaria, cholera and yellow fever)
Surgery to deal with impacted & infected sinuses
Cyst removal => one from the tailbone and one from her Bartholin's vaginal
gland
Wears an insulin pump. 
Many antibiotics over a long period of time
Cymbalta => for depression. 

Measurement:
Parathyroid
Thymus (L)
Insulin High
Adrenals
Thyroid (R)

It took 3 whiplash treatments with Ozaliet to bring these points up, plus I
used anti-tetanus, polio and pertussis in the rods. 

Veins (L) - last 3 points
Arteries (L) - 3 points (1,2 + 5)
Nervous System (L) - 2nd point 
Large Intestines (L) - points 3, 4 

Veins (R) - points 3, 4
Arteries (R) - points 1, 2 and 5
Nervous System (R) - point 5 
Large Intestines (R) - point 3
Lungs - points 1 and 3.

Bladder (L) - points 3, 4
Bladder (R) - point 3

>12 yrs Treatment:
Anti-Tetanus, Poliomyelitis, Pertussis, Sinusitis, Appendicitis, Salmonella
Typhi, Staphylococcen, Staphylococcus Aureus

Footplate Treatment:
Diphterie, Meningococcum, China, Berberis, Thyroidea, Syzygium, Reneel,
Solidago

Everything seemed to clear by the end of the session.

Questions:

1. I wonder about the sequence of her treatment. Should I wait with clearing
the Antibiotics until her digestive organs can handle it?

2. The cysts are probably indications of poor circulation, right?  Her kidneys
did not seem problematic, but would they be masking the core issue?  
What in her circulation would cause this?  If her parathyroid has been off,
should I suspect calcification?

3. What is making her so tired?  This intense exhaustion only began about 2
months ago.

4. I meant to treat her for Tonsillitis, even though her Lymphatic System
didn't show up.  Wouldn't that be a prime suspect in this scenario?

Many thanks for your time and insights!

    Answers:

    1. I would advise against clearing the antibiotics from her system, since
    there's no way you can know whether they are still in her body. When
    antibiotics or any other toxin or drug is still in the system, usually they
    will be eliminated during the course of the treatments. 

    2. You are correct, cysts are caused by poor circulation. So now you'll
    have to find out what the cause of the circulation issue is? Most likely it
    is the exhausted adrenals, which might also be the cause of her extreme
    exhaustion and her depression. 
    I also suspect a problem with her Arteries and Veins caused by
    calcification and the resulting weakness of the valves in her Veins.

    3. You measured a Whiplash, did something (e.g. fall, accident,
    chiropractic treatment..) happen 2 months ago? 
    Or was there something that caused stress during that time?

    4. Chronic Tonsillitis is indeed a huge suspect, although her nasal
    congestion could also have been caused by Whiplash or by the Bladder
    meridian. Tonsilltis often goes together with Appendicitis. I suggest you
    try the Chronic form or the Necroticans too and see what points it clears. 

    Other comments:

    #1. I have noticed that you did not use anything for the Bladder. This is a
    Yang organ and should have been addressed before the Yin organs(Staph). I
    do not see any nosode to deal with those drops.

    #2  Exhaustion is generally caused by Adrenals, Liver or Large Intestines.
    In her case it might be all three.
   
    #3 Whiplash treatment (as well as local and scar treatment) should be done
    without any remedy.

    #3. So the procranium remedy is used with the glass rods on a short program
    not in the scar treatment? I'm thinking of over the tonsils.

    Question:
   
    *Also, what's the best way to treat mesh implants inserted with
    laparoscoptic instruments? Does the entire area benefit from scar
    treatment?

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    November 2013 edited November 2013 Flag
    The way it has always been done is by adding Procrainum in the Scar
    Treatment, but this is just another way to add an extra remedy to the whole
    session. It is good to realize that: you can never bring in a remedy just
    locally! Whether you put in a remedy in the Hand treatment, the Footplate
    treatment or a Scar/Whiplash treatment, the remedy will have the same
    effect internally. 

    We have seen that because this is not realised, sometimes many extra
    remedies are put into the Scar treatment, adding to the total "remedy-load"
    and hence compromising the effect of the whole treatment by overloading the
    body. More is definitely not better... and the Scar treatment was never
    meant to load up with remedies.

    * I think that any location where surgery has been performed can benefit
    from Scar/Whiplash treatments.
  •

    I think I understand what you mean that putting only Procrainum in the hand
    rods will treat the whole body even it I've placed the rods over the
    tonsils. Which was a demonstration given by Johann back in May to our
    beginning group to do for folks with chronic tonsil issues. But I think
    when he did this, he used a short program and not the scar treatment
    program??

    Its a little confusing because we were talking too about having the tonsil
    surgerically removed.

    *Yeah, sometime clients have mesh placed over the entire bladder, or uterus
    area, or colon. So in that case its a large somewhat unknown border area.
    We would use rods not the little probes is that best?

    Thank you
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    Yes, that's what I meant. 

    That is why you could run the Procrainum in the Standard Hand Treatment,
    and run the Scar Program over the Tonsils without any remedy and have the
    same end result.
    It is however the Scar Treatment that you need to use, since it is
    (internal scars) that you want to treat.
   
    For Internal Scars the Glass Rods should be used, since the metal of the
    Scar wires only reaches the surface, and hardly penetrates the skin.

Small Spots on Face.

liselottewliselottew
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client: 55 year old man. Spots all over his face. Skin is red, spots has some
yellow substanse in some of them. Since a year ago. 

Symptoms: 
Spots on skin almost gone. He think he got it after smelling on a lot of hay.
They do that to check the quality. 
Hurts in right leg when lying in a certain angle in bed. Feels like electricity
through his leg. Area between Gallbladder and Small Intestines meridian on his
leg. Not quite sure, but think its Gallbladder meridian. 
Swollen Testicle after riding a horse. Think it's because of misfitting saddle.
Surgery of Testicles about 20 years ago (Testical brock- Testicle swollen,
retaining to much fluids). 
I've treated the Testicle area with the Whiplash program. But only got small
improvement in his skin then. And then it got worse again and again. 

Doctor's diagnosis and treatment: 
Skin Disease that is now being treated with Penicillin (2,5 months). He has to
take them 6 months. Spots almost gone. Much better. He does not feel good about
taking Penicilin. Wondering about quitting the Penicillin. 

Measurements + Hand Treatment: 
Thyroid - Thalamus 
Sexual glands - Carcinoma Uteri 
Large Intestines - Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis 
Bladder - Schwefheel, 
Lymphatic System - Chronic Tonsillitis 
Lung - Staphyloccus Aureus   

Footplate Treatment:
Large Intestines - Salmonella Thyphi,  Belladonna, Mucosa, Tonsilla Comp,
Chelidonium.


Questions: 
1. Can bacterias get Penicillin resistance if he stops now? He has 3 months
left with the Penicillin. 
2. Can I treat him while he is being treated with Penicillin? 
3. I have measured Schwefheel some times on his Bladder. Again today. Am I
measuring wrong? Can I measure it 3 times? He says that he is not eating any
sulfur or other suplements. So I cant see how he would get more into his body
again. 
4. What can be causing Spots on the Skin?

    1. I think this is something that can always happen but is not a specific
    concern if he's been using the Penicillin for such a long time already.
    There are also very short prescriptions of Penicillin and it is just a
    matter of what the doctor decides to give a patient... 

    2. Yes, you can treat through the Penicillin, although this is not
    optimal. 

    3. Testing sulphur (Schwefheel) doesn't mean that there has to be a
    physical sulphur intoxication. If Schwefheel matches on the Bladder
    meridian this can mean there's a Bladder infection or weakness, which
    according the Homeopathic Materia Medica are both indicated for the remedy
    Sulphur.
   
    4. Did you measure the Skin meridian? It can be many things... but if a
    skin infection is clearing up with Penicillin it has to be a bacteria,
    since viral infections won't react on it. Maybe you can see if Strep or
    Staph matches when next time you measure the Skin meridian.
   
    Some questions:

    a. Was there a specific idea behind testing Carcinoma Uteri on the Bladder
    meridian? This is not impossible to match, since it might resonate with
    another type of cancer, but it is something I wouldn't pick just to test on
    a man. Only if I would suspect cancer and there was no other cancer nosode
    that matches I would try Carcinoma Uteri maybe....

    b. With Testicular swelling as one of his major symptoms I would also
    support more on Veins, Lymphatic System and Circulation... Have you worked
    on this in previous treatments? What did you use?
  •

    3. I did not know that, good to know. Then I should test Cystopenitis and
    Cantharis instead next time if it drops? 

    4. Yes I will try that. Have just started measuring the Cartilage and Skin
    meridians now on clients. With new information from course. 

    a. Sexual gland on the hormonal system. I just followed protocol. I
    measured all the other nosodes in the protocol first. Sorry if I was
    unclear. 

    B. I have worked with Vaccines, Parasites, Coxsackie, Cystopenitis,
    Albumoheel, cutis. But this was a while back. I will write new measurements
    when I have them. I will think about that in my next treatment. 

    He just recently felt symptoms from Testicular swelling again. Just started
    treating him again after he wanted to test a Penicillum for his skin.

    3. Yes, if you didn't test for Cystopyelonephritis, Bacteria or Heavy
    Metals you should do that, but if you followed the suggestions and order in
    the measurement protocol, you probably already did without result?
    Cantharis is the support for bladder infection and should mainly be used as
    such and might match if none of the nosodes do.

    a. It is true that Carcinoma Uteri is mentioned in the protocol for the
    Bladder meridian, because this is where you can measure Uterus problems.
    But since men don't have a Uterus, I would usually measure Carcinoma Uteri
    only for women except when there's a reason for trying it such as a similar
    cancer... Resonance with a remedy can also be there if there's a similarity
    (homeopathic principle).
   
    b. Ok so try to see how you can get the swelling down by supporting Veins,
    Lymph and Circulation. I'm wondering if by accident the Carcinoma Uteri was
    the right remedy for Testicular Swelling... who knows, since it did
    resonate on the Sexual Organs.
    I'd like to hear about the result your treatment had on the swelling.

    The Thyroid could also be affected by Pertussis or by the Tonsils.

    You can definitely treat while he is on the anti-biotics. you can put also
    Penicillin in the slots. Penicillin only suppresses. The moment he stops,
    the bacteria will come to the surface again and symptoms might come back
    but that will also happen when he stops in three months. The bacteria have
    withdrawn in the tissues and are simply waiting until the coast is clear
    again.

    The swelling in his Testis indicates a Bruising/Inflammation of some sorts.
    You might treat with Arnica and stimulate the Circulation.

    3. Well I did not have the protocol when I treated him in the past. But the
    last treatment I had it and I treated according to protocol, so then I
    should have tried those nosodes there first on the dropping point already. 
    I don't remember right now, but I will look for more Heavy Metals and
    Bacteria. 

     A. Of course, I was only following the protocol. Did not think of that at
    the moment. 

     B. I will keep you updated.

    He has now stopped the anti-biotics. I will inform him about that. There is
    no nosode that can match if its an inflammation of the testicle?

    You could try Medorrhinum as a nosode for the Swollen/Inflamed Testicles. 

    Brucella Abortus Bang or Tuberculinum are also Homeopathic nosodes that
    have indications for this....

    See if any of these match on the Sex-Organ point on the Bladder meridian.

    April 2013 Flag
    He had back pains- stiff in back, problems in getting up from bed-all gone
    after treatment.

    Not better with his testicle brock. Still to swollen, to much fluids. He
    says that it is a well known problem for men who ride horses.. Because of
    the trauma to testicle from the saddel. When the horse is moving and the
    rider is sitting down its bumpy. He is now on one week vacation. Maby good
    for the testicle to not be riding for a week.

    Skinn is not nosible diffrence . The penecillin had taken the most of the
    spots away. He is mostly very red and dry in his skinn on his face. So he
    cant tell me any noticable diffrent on skin after treatment. I guess that
    its a chance that the spots will re appear, now that he has ended
    penecillin cure.

    Question:
    1.since the testiclebrock is reaccuring in periods, is there a cause behind
    the swollen testicle or just the trauma by riding?
    2. There where no dropps on skin merridians. Where els could I look for
    strept and stafyl? Exept the ones in protocol. Kidneys and bladder?

    Skin issues are generally caused by toxins wanted to get out. One of the
    remedies that might work is Variolinum.

    The Testicle issue might just be continued trauma to the area, in any case
    he needs a longer rest.
    Further swelling in the Testicles could also be caused by exhausted
    Adrenals, weak Heart or weak Valves or Calcification in the Valves (in the
    Veins)

    Ok I will think about that in my treatments. 

    Reactions since last: 
    Client has been on vacation.
     
    Testicle less swollen, but he has not ridden a horse in a week. When he is
    sitting down in saddel during troth, he experiences more swelling. Some
    saddles make the condition worse, so he tries to avoid these. 

    Still has a weird feeling on the outside of his right thigh. It is a
    tingling sensation, that sometimes feels like very hot water on the skin.
    He feels this mostly when standing or lying on his back. When there's a
    change in position or he's lying down, it will go away immediately.

Surgical Removal of Thyroid

rmargilrmargil
September 2014 edited September 2014 in General Questions Flag
I have a client who wonders if Biophoton therapy can be helpful to her even
though she has had both her Thyroid and Parathyroid removed during surgery. Is
it possible to regulate calcium metabolism without a Parathyroid gland?

Comments

    Regarding regulation of calcium metabolism:
    When all 4 Parathyroid glands have been removed, this is of course not
    possible. 

    However, this must be checked. Normally the Parathyroid glands are on the
    top of the Thyroid wings, but in quite a few cases they are instead on the
    back of the throat.

    Also, the blueprint of the glands is still there in any case and the
    energetic function of the glands has not been removed. It might well be
    that the energetic function is more important and that a lot can be
    restored. 
   
    Regarding the removed Thyroid:
    I have been told that the Thyroid has the strong possibility to regrow and
    that the Thyroid medication is mainly there to stop this from happening. In
    any case the energetic function must be restored.
   
    I would not make any promises, but explain the situation and ask if she
    wants to try the treatment anyway.

    Hi in my experience with thyroid patients who were on Thyroid meds, with
    know Thyroid shrinkage, the use of Thyroid gladular did increase the
    Thyroid gland size.  Over time the dose of the glandular was reduced to a
    minimum. 
    I Suppose with the Chiren this should also occur since the Chiren gives the
    body the ability to produce the necessary items for they thyroid to work
    without the use of a glandular or a drug...at least I hope so

    I have seen two clients who had their Thyroid grow back. They just needed
    the Chiren treatment. 

    To get this result it is necessary to stop the Thyroid medication the
    moment the Thyroid point stays balanced (no drop anymore in the initial
    measurement)

    In my experience most people do not want to stop their Thyroid medication.

Lyme Disease

I have quite a few clients with Lyme Disease. I understand that Lyme is only a
symptom and am following protocol, treating the terrain.

Questions:
1. Are there any other areas of focus/support, specific to Lyme, that you
recommend?
2. Is it helpful to make a neutralized remedy from the Tic?
3. If making a remedy in this way, should the Tic be pulverized?

    Again, the Forum has a lot of info on this.  

    According to protocol there is 'no focus' except that of the client in the
    moment of treatment.  
    If you follow the protocal, i.e. Check for Spin Inversion, then read the
    points, if in Whiplash treat for it, the proceed to follow the protocol.  
    To paraphrase Johan, your diagnosis is a guide, don't make it a trap where
    you focus on Lymes.  If it comes up in later treatments then use it.  If it
    comes up in the first treatment it should only be on the Kidney meridian,
    since you will only be focusing on the Hormones, Kidney and Ciruculation
    and maybe Appendix Necrotans..  Exciting and good luck...

    Yes, I fully understand that the focus never is Lyme - and always follow
    Protocol as the first priority.
    I do find that the Forum has a wealth of information which is extremely
    helpful.
    I just wondered if there were any other specifics that Johan might suggest
    from his experience.

    Thanks Karolina.  It feels important to be able to ask these questions as I

    I have read a research paper that states there is a connection between
    Mercury toxicity and Lyme. Has Johan ever encountered this?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    September 2015 edited September 2015 Flag
    The main correlation that has been found with Lyme is enormous and
    persistent stress, often (but not always) caused by a traumatic childhood.
    This is what is seen in almost 100% of the "Lyme" cases we encounter. 
    It is very important for this group of people to learn how to respect their
    own and others' boundaries in a healthy way, and to connect to their own
    core/strength to become more independent. 

    A direct correlation between Mercury toxicity and Lyme has not been found. 
    However, if you consider the total stress load to be causative, indirectly
    a correlation with Heavy Metal toxicity may be possible (Mercury is a
    stressor that can add to the total stress-load that will ultimately lead to
    Lyme symptoms) Heavy Metal toxicity also makes one more sensitive to
    radiation. 
   
    Another source of stress that seems to be causative in the birth of the
    "Lyme syndrome" is EMF. 
    The first cell phone systems were developed/tested in the early seventies,
    the first Lyme case showed up in 1975. Client's who identify themselves as
    being Lyme patients are often very sensitive to EMF.

Can the Chiren Induce Vomiting

BiophotonBalance
February 2013 edited January 2014 in General Questions Flag
Ipecac syrup (a syrup made from a plant used as a medicine that causes
vomiting) is no longer available, even in the pharmacy.  Salt water can help
induce vomiting, but it took longer than we would have liked, in our
experience.  If you need to induce vomiting for someone, is there a way the
Chiren can be utilized to do this?

    Hi Peter/Shanna,

    Inducing vomiting is not something that is, directly possible through the
    Chiren treatment. 

    A body that doesn't vomit when necessary (e.g. to eliminate something toxic
    that was ingested) can restore that ability when the immune-recognition
    starts functioning again because of treatment, but this is something
    different then what you're aiming for I suspect.

    Why do you want to induce the vomiting?
  •

    For example, if a child swallows something that would harm the body such as
    a poison or a metal bolt or something like that.  Years ago we had a child
    remove the child-proof cap on a medication and drink a portion of a bottle
    of amoxicillin that was for a sibling's ear infection and we recently had a
    child swallow a piece of metal.  These crazy moments happen often with
    children.  Ipecac syrup used to be given out freely from a doctor in case
    of accidental poisoning for children.  The alternative is an Emergency Room
    situation where the doctor would give medication and do perhaps an x-ray to
    see the item of concern.  This can be a costly situation and often not
    necessary for the child (obviously depending on what they just swallowed;
    certain items would be better to go through the system because they may
    cause more harm coming back up).

    I have never heard of a remedie to support this kind of reaction. 
   
    It is clearly important to see every case new- depending on the size and
    what is swallowed and the degree of danger of the intaken poison. 
    if it turns dramatic or very painful I would definitily go to the emergency
    room. 
    Even vomitting up a piece can get stuck in the throat so I would be very
    careful here like we all would be. 

    If you should find the situation under control and choose to treat with
    Chiren, I would keep a close look at all the drops and see how the
    Hormomnal system, Nerval system andKidneys, LIver and Circulation are doing
    and support a healthy detox with the drops you find. 
    But again the question was more about we do have a remedie in Chiren to
    induge vomitting and I have not come across that. 
   
    Maybe Karolina has a good tip form her extended knowledge of the remedies?

    No, I don't think the Chiren can induce vomiting in a situation like this.
    and I think Nora is right that it could be dangerous too to induce vomiting
    if it is a big or rough object.

    However, Ipecacuanha D4  (homeopathic remedy) is part of the compositum
    remedy Mucosa, so you might try that. Maybe it does something..... All
    potencies below D9 should have a similar action on the body as the original
    substance the remedy was created with, so in this case Ipecacuanha D4
    should help induce vomiting.

    But maybe inducing vomiting is the same as creating some imbalance in the
    body and then the remedy is not going to "take" for this purpose since with
    the two rods it is impossible to bring in information that is disturbing to
    the body.


    The information about remedies is not something that I have in my head.
    With a little bit of googling it is not so hard to find these things out.
    There's a lot about the Heel Compositum remedies on the internet....

    Yes the same condition can affect the feet, but then it has a different

    I have no experience with this. But what I found on the internet is that it
    might be linked to Liver disease, which fits the connection Liver-Tendons
    of chinese medicine. So if you start treating you can keep this in mind and
    see if you find Liver problems.

Lyme's & Co-Infections no Longer Resonate after 7 Treatments

April 2013 edited January 2014 in Measurement Flag

Without going into details...is it possible after 7 treatments to believe that
a patient no longer has Lyme's disease if they no longer resonate with anything
related to it (Borrelia, Bartonella, Q-Fever, Lyme's, etc.) - as they always
have before? They do feel MUCH better, too. I will test again on Wednesday to
see if this continues. Does Johan believe that this can happen so quickly? The
person got very sick twice, and then felt great the last time (this is not the
lady with root canals). Thank you.

    It is definitely possible. I think it is even rather long.

    In my experience: if the Terrain is improving, the body will take care of
    the bugs. Focus on the terrain, not so much on the bugs!
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    April 2013 Flag
    Also remember that having resonance or not having resonance with a certain
    remedy doesn't prove the bug is actually there or not there. Resonance
    means that a client has similar disturbances as the bug would have given if
    it was there (Homeopathic Similarity!). So it can either be there or not be
    there.... A good reason to never diagnose with the Chiren!

    However the fact that she lost resonance with these remedies is a good sign
    that disturbances related to these bugs are improving... This is also seen
    in your client getting better though. 

    There are no rules in Lyme's disease. Some people recover very fast, some
    struggle for a longer time. It depends on many factors and a big one is
    Stress....

    Question 2
    Do solar panels on the roof of the house create any unwanted fields, and
    effect the health of people indoor?

    Johan's Answer
    The panels themselves do create some weak fields, but not strong enough to
    affect anybody.
    The batteries that are linked up to the panels could be more damaging. I
    have no idea about the fields they create so cannot say more about this. I
    would be careful with the location of these batteries though.

    The inverter connected to the system can be problematic (I've heard that

Scar Treatment with Pads

Renate
March 2015 edited April 2015 in Therapy Questions Flag
For scar treatments: I prefer to use the electrical cables if the snap is wide
enough to touch skin on both sides of the scar. This way the treatment will
benefit energetic scars and also physical scars if done less than 3" apart.
Because the program is very short, I normally hold them in place rather than
using the pads.

Questions
1. The gel, which is normally considered the active portion of an EKG pad, is
not much larger than the snap. However, it was stated in a Basic I class that
that energy transmits beyond the gel portion and to the EDGE of the larger
paper/sticky tape. Is that true? Is this why it is advised in the manual to use
pads rather than to hold the electrodes for such a brief treatment?

2. The manual advises using sticky pads for physical scars and to keep the
distance between the electrodes less than 3" apart. Depending on the size of
the pads the electrodes may be further than 3" apart from each other even if
both pads are touching each other. If the treatment does not transmit through
the paper tape and to its edge, then depending on the size of the pads the
treatment may be more than 3” apart which would render the physical scar
treatment ineffective.

3. If the treatment goes to the edge of the sticky pad, then the 3" measurement
would be from the edge of one pad to the edge of the other.  Is that  increase
of surface/treatment area, to the entire width of the pad, the main advantage
of using the pad?

4. When using the biofeedback function extra gel is required to provide
additional conductivity. Is it advisable to also ad gel if using the pads
during a scar treatment?

    Remember that there are two ways we treat scars. Energetic and cosmetic.
    Ligtht is always best to treat energetic scars.

    cosmetic scars can be done with pads.

    Peter:

    We both agree that there are two types of scars.  What you are referring to
    as cosmetic scars are what I called physical scars above.

    We both agree that cosmetic/physical scars can be done with pads.  My
    questions deals with some very specific details of their use.
     
    The electrical cables are every bit as effective with energetic scars when
    it comes to reconnecting the meridians just beneath the skin.  That is how
    energetic scars were originally treated prior to Johan's development of the
    light rods. 

    For deeper scars, say inside the abdomen, the rods must be used since they
    reach further into the body. - Although it is difficult to measure the
    effectiveness of rods on those deep scars. 

    I have seen Johan use the cable's for energetically reconnecting meridians
    when the cables are already connected to the Chiren.  Because therapists
    don't always have the cables connected, using the rods is often more
    convenient which is perfectly acceptable to do.

    Should we always use pads or little round metal/plastic connectors will do
    if we press them into the skin?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    April 2015 Flag
    The pads generally cover a bigger area than the snap. However, in my
    experience it does not make much difference in the effects, as long as the
    snap or pads cover the area of the scar AND the surrounding healthy
    tissue. 

    There are ECG pads of various size. Some of the pads are gel pads, on other
    pads you need to apply conducting gel. If the pad is of high conductive
    material, then the energy goes to the edge of the pad.
    I do not understand what you mean by "paper or sticky tape"

    The pads are NOT allowed to touch each other. In case the pads are that
    close together I would use smaller pads or not use pads at all. In that
    case I would probably use the snaps alone

    The advantage of using the pads is that a larger area of healthy tissue is
    used, but on the whole it does not make a lot of difference.The main thing
    is that the snaps or pads are touching a large part of healthy tissue as
    well as the scar tissue

    The treatment with the electrical system will also unblock the energetic
    pathways.
    The treatment with the fibre optic system will also improve physical scars,
    but less so than the electrical system.

    In general:
    Physical scars => treat with the electrical system
    Energetic scars like whiplash => treat with the fibre optic system
  •

    What I meant by sticky tape is that only the center of the pad has gel. The
    outer part appears to be only paper with adhesive and NO gel. This adhesive
    is needed, otherwise the pad will fall off.
    Here is a LINK of the underside of a pad.

    Questions
    1. Is the 3" rule referring to the edge of the adhesive tape/pad which
    appears to have NO conductive gel or is it from the edge of the prejelled
    area in the center of the pad?

    2. When you use the term physical scar, are you ALSO referring to the
    energetic scar/blockage of the meridian below it?  In other words: 
    If someone has a very long scar, and is not concerned about its appearance,
    is it necessary to treat every 3” when the broken meridian is actually an
    energetic problem (much like an energetic whiplash)?
   
    3. For a scar that is not at the same level as the surrounding skin, such
    as a scar going down the sternum due to bypass surgery with pectoral
    muscles on either side, when placing the rods horizontally across the
    pectoral muscles the scar will not be touched. This may be a good time to
    use the electrical cables with snaps. However the scar may be too wide to
    also touch healthy tissue on both sides. If the gel part in the center of a
    pad is the only part that conducts, then there is no advantage to using
    them. - Why not hold them in place so their hair chest is not pulled when
    they are removed? - Especially if, depending on your answer above, that
    painful removal must be done every three inches…

    Answers:
    1. There are many kinds of pads. The ones we use are totally conductive. I
    use square adhesive pads that are 1 inch wide on all sides and are 100%
    conductive. 
    There are also pads that have a metal center and the rest is just an
    adhesive.
    3" is the maximal distance allowed between the contact areas of the pads
    (the gelled part).

    2. It IS the physical scar that blocks the meridian flow. When I use the
    term physical scar, I am referring to a scar which is physically
    observable. Every physical scar also has an energetic component to it.
    Physical scars should always be treated the way that is described in the
    manual. I would never limit the treatment to doing the energetic part only,
    since the physical scar could keep the energetic part in place. 

    3. I recommend that practitioners have a gel at hand that they can apply or
    have pads of different sizes to apply. Then they could gel also the area
    that is outside the reach of the pads.
    On scar tissue there is no hair growing. To the sides perhaps, normally
    this is shaven at the time of surgery. You can also advise to shave the
    area prior to treatment.

    I tried to demonstrate a treatment yesterday on the case described above. 
    The rods could not be used horizontally across the sternum.  And the snaps
    were too small.  I came up with a workaround by placing a big dollop of
    electroconductive gel on the disposable pads to extend conductivity to the
    edge of the paper.  It also had the advantage of not pulling the mans chest
    hair each time the pads were relocated. 

    Thought I would share, in case others find themselves in a similar
    situation, since some of us already have gel in our office for use with the
    biofeedback feature of the Chiren.

    In the meantime, if anyone has a link for pads, that are pregelled all the
    way to the edge, please post the source.  Thanks.

After three treatments
Client reports that blood sugar is high and has now come down with Flu like
symptoms.

Questions:
1. Is having the Insulin Pump creating the Spin Inversions

2. What should I tell her about the high blood sugar. Should she have her pump
re-calibrated. I remember Johan saying that higher blood sugar is normal for
diabetics after beginning treatments but don't recall what should be done about
it.

3. Can the diabetes actually be improved or alleviated completely through
biophoton treatments? If so, approximately how many treatments are required? I
realize this may be difficult to answer but what is the range?

    Answers:
    1. An Insulin Pump is generally not responsible for Spin Inversions.
    But I don't think Spin Inversion is the problem, and that there's probably
    a Measurement problem. I might be wrong, but the extreme low readings with
    the condition of Diabetes (=Bad Circulation) and possible use of Skin Cream
    give me the suspicion that the Measurement might be an issue. (see
    explanation below)

    2. Blood Sugar rises during Stress, and the lifting of suppression might
    cause this. But it might also be because you did not address the
    Gallbladder, while most likely it is involved.
    However what you probably picked up in class is that when you start
    lowering the dose of Insulin, Blood Sugar will not immediately be regulated
    properly. The body first has to adjust to the new situation and start to
    produce more Insulin.
    But you only start lowering the dose of Insulin in a situation where
    there's improvement and the Insulin low point is balanced during your first
    Measurement of a Session.
    I suggest to focus on the Gallbladder (Nosodes and Support) when Stress
    causes Blood Sugar to rise. If this doesn't work, we'll need to look for
    other answers. But I would first try this.

    3. The amount of treatments needed is dependent on several factors, first
    of course the responsiveness of your client to the treatment. But also your
    ability to find the Remedies, especially Nosodes, that work in balancing
    her System, and to treat it in the right order. When I look at your
    treatments there is a lot to improve there. There's not much of an approach
    or consistency. I'll try to help you with that….

    * I miss the treatment of her C-section! This is a Scar Treatment that
    can't be skipped….

    * You treat with Strep Heamolyticus the first session, while this is most
    likely to match on Heart or Lung. These are Yin Organs and should be left
    alone until the Hormone System and dropping Yang Organs -in this case the
    Large Intestine and Small Intestine- are fairly balanced.

    * Did you try Appendicitis Necroticans or Chronic Appendicitis at all? The
    many points dropping on the Intestines definitely point in that direction.
    Also in a huge percentage of clients a form of Appendicitis is present, so
    this is one to always be aware of.

    * The "low readings" are not so much (directly) related to the energy of
    your client, but to his Circulation. Circulation is always a problem with
    Diabetes….
    Another possible problem is that your client because of her dry skin uses
    lotion or cream before treatments. This will influence Skin conductivity in
    a way that your readings are low, dropping, or just impossible to get….
    Let your client wash hands and feet thoroughly with soap in this case.

    * The second session there's not much improvement in the Measurement or
    Symptoms, which shows the first treatment wasn't very successful. With so
    many points dropping Appendicitis (any form) is a big suspect and it seems
    strange that Variolinum, Baryodeel or Nagelmykose would clear these all.
    The second Measurement of your second Treatment shows this to be true… no
    improvement.
    (Again I really suspect a Measurement issue)

    * Then, with still all these drops on important Systems, you choose to
    treat only with Support Remedies on the Footplates. Also the Supports
    chosen are not very focussed on the problem. But mainly you need to look
    for Nosodes to correct all those drops!

    * In non of the Sessions the Parathyroid was corrected during the initial
    Measurement. Trying to work on Calcification with Baryodeel, Aurumheel or
    Calculi Billiaris before the Cause (malfunctioning Parathyroid) is
    corrected is useless.

    * In Session 2 you use Baryodeel both on the Rods and on the Footplates.
    This has no added advantage. Exposure to the Information of a Remedy in one
    Treatment (in one Session) is sufficient.

    * Nagelmykose is a strange remedy to choose. Nail fungus can never be
    Causal -fungus appears in the body or in any other living system as a
    consequence, when there's a lot of "decay"- and is not likely to match on
    any of the Meridians you'd want to correct in these treatments (Hormone
    System, Yang Organs). Diabetic Skin conditions will automatically clear
    when the internal condition of the body improves, so you'll need to get to
    the Cause of the Diabetes.

    * The 3rd Session -and with all those drops!- you don't use any Nosode at
    all, except for Calculi Billiaris, which you should also not treat before
    the Parathyroid is corrected.
    The Nosodes are needed to go beyond Symptom Treatment and get to the Cause.
    So I am not surprised that your treatments did not improve her condition.

    * This is definitely not the time to lower Insulin

    * When I see the symptoms I have to think about the remedy Arsenicum Album,
    which is in Mezereum. This might be an extra option along with the other
    Supports, that you specifically choose to assist the Organs you are
    focussing on with Nosodes.

    * The general approach to Diabetes in Biontology:

    - The Biophoton Treatments only offer Support, the body must deal with the
    Blood Sugars itself.
    - First bring all Hormone System points in balance, but also the points
    relating to the Digestive System.
    - When all these points are in balance, the client needs to start reducing
    the Insulin intake, for example with 10% for about 2 weeks.
    - During the course of your treatment, Blood Sugars need to be monitored
    continuously.
    - Educate the client, so they don't get fearful or worried. Everybody's
    blood sugar gets up, but does not stay up.
    - When the Blood Sugars go up to extreme heights, you need to treat
    immediately. Then see if they drop as result of the treatment. The client
    should in this case not up the Insulin. The body is so used to getting the
    Insulin, that it has stopped producing sufficiently.
    - During this same time you need to measure the Insulin Point to see how
    the body reacts energetically.
    - If the Blood Sugars have stabilized again, and the Insulin point is still
    balanced, the client can reduce another 10%.
    - and so on….

    Thank you Johan,

    Have been treating as directed for several weeks.
    (I had actually treated her C-Section Scar in the first treatment but
    failed to report it here.)
    All points now balanced ==> Exceptions below:

    Symptoms
    Client still feels cold.
    Bowel movements are much less frequent.
    Toenails still appear dry and very unhealthy looking although client feels
    they seem better than before.

    Session 2/17/14
    1st measurement:
    Veins 2 pts (L) 2 pts(R)

    >12 yr. Program:
    Aurumheel, Syzygium, Mellilotus, Selenium, Atropinum, Aesculus

    2nd Measurement:
    No Drops

    Dyslexia Program:
    Circulo, Placenta, Ozaliet, Fringed violet, Mezereum

    Result
    During >12 yr treatment, client reported feeling much warmer and said she
    could actually feel the treatment working.

    Questions:
    I advised her to begin lowering insulin by 10% and to monitor
    Per advice==> if Blood Sugars go to extreme heights, need to treat
    immediately:
     1. What do you consider an extreme height?
     2. How quickly would I need to treat? Minutes? Hours? Within 24 hrs? 2
        days?
     3. What are the potential dangers of not treating quickly enough?
     4. Client is worried about feeling pain if Blood Sugar goes too high 
     5. Should the blood be tested immediately after treatment?
     6. What should I do if treatment doesn't lower the blood sugar?
     7. I assume that I would be treating primarily with Gallbladder remedies
        and perhaps Selenium in such an emergency situation. Is this correct?
     8. Is it useful to try to treat the toenails with Cutis or Nagelmykose,
        for the toenails at this point?

    Answers:

    1. The levels are presented in a different way in the US. Your client will
    know what is unacceptably high. It also really depends how long someone
    stays on this level… fluctuating Blood Sugar is normal.

    2. Increase in blood sugars is normal => If they stay high after about 5-6
    hours, you need to treat

    3. I do not think there are great potential dangers other than the normal
    risks of high blood sugar, which has to become extremely high to pose an
    acute risk. But it is advised to respond soon to assist the body normalise
    blood sugar metabolism.

    5. There is an advantage of testing blood sugars before and after treatment
    to see what the treatments does, IF the blood sugar levels have an elevated
    level before treatment…

    7. You always should treat with Gallbladder remedies to lower blood sugars.
    Remember that any form of stress causes blood sugars to rise, so the first
    thing to do for your patients is to relax.

    8. You can treat symptomatically as you suggest, but Fungus thrives in
    humid environment, so when you use these remedies, the cause of moist/
    sweaty feet should be addressed too.

Flu - Symptom Aggravation

SabaKeiserSabaKeiser
February 2013 edited February 2014 in General Questions Flag

Client:
Female, 54 years old, normal figure, in her menopause

Symptoms:
She came because of hot flush

Psoriasis, Arthritis, Allergies to: dog and cat hair, cherry, apple, hazelnut
and pollen.

Anamnesis:
She was a healthy child and with 16 she began to get allergic reactions (she
went on vacation to Spain to her aunt and the wool blanket seems to have
triggered the allergic reactions).

With approx. 28 years she started to get psoriasis on her elbows and knees and
10 years later she got psoriasis arthritis. Because of the pain she was given
very strong medication. She got Methodrexat (also used in chemotherapy) over 3
years and until last November was taking Arava.

She is the third child out of four. Father died in 2010 of diabetes, parkinson
and osteoporoses. Mother is healthy. Sister has hypothyreosis.

Measurement and treatment:

First treatment: Drops on almost all points
Spin-Inversion, Whiplash, Scars, Vaccinations, Berberis, Cystopyelonephritis,
Solidago, Variolinum, Calculi Renales, neutralised Arava

Second treatment: Drops on Triple Warmer, Small Intestine, Heart, Circulation,
Large Intestine, Lung, Lymphatic System, Kidneys, Gallbladder

Spin-Inversion, Whiplash, Vaccinations, Metals, Ovarium, Calculi Renales,
Populus, Belladonna, Cholecystitis, Chronic appendicitis, Placenta, Aesulus,
Angioheel, Circulo

Third treatment: This time more drops than the second time almost all points
dropped

Spin-Inversion, Whiplash, Cortison, Inv. Prednison, Klimaktheel, Psorinum,
Fibroma Pendulum, Berberis

Sixth treatment: Drops on Heart, Circulation, Large Intestine, Lungs, Lymphatic
System, Bladder, Kidneys, Gallbladder and Liver

Spin-Inversion, Whiplash, Cystopyelonephritis,Carcinoma Uteri, Klimaktheel,
Sabal Homaccord, Penicilinum, Carcinoma Hepatis, Coenzyme, Hepeel, Leptandra,
Pfeiffer, Psorinum, Candida Albicans, Aurumheel, Barijodeel, Appendicitis
Necroticans, Tuberculinum, Mercuriusheel, Trichmonaden, Coxsackie A9, Glonoin

After six sessions her hot flushes were reduced from hourly hot flushes to one
or two per night. She was feeling fine not taking the strong medication anymore
and also not being painedn. She was ready to go further with this treatment and
not going back to the drugs she was taking before. She got the flu after new
year an from that point on her condition got bad. She is suffering from a lot
of pain in her back, neck, chest, her knees are swollen and painful and her hot
flushes are also getting more also the psoriasis flame up.

We had 4 more sessions and all Kidney points drop, there are also drops on the
Gallbladder and Liver, Large Intestine, Thyroid

Question:

She told me that she has hours and even almost whole days feeling completely
healthy and is so happy and enjoying it and then the pain comes back again
(different hours - organ clock). But this is her motivation to gain that
feeling back she didn't have for almost 25 years. 

After the flu everything went bad - before that it was going well. And after
this flu her kidneys seem to be in a bad condition and not getting better.
Where should I pay attention to help her kidneys to get better? I told her to
go to the Doctor to have the kidneys checked. Then she told me that she went to
the doctor when she had the flu and they told her there is blood in the urine
but there is no infection...

    If all or most points drop, then the indiction is always Appendicitis(
    Necroticans or Chronic) and/or Tonsillitis.

    If this is the case then her Intestinal Flora is gone and has probably
    moved to Kidneys and other organs. So try one or more Intestinal Bacteria
    on the Kidneys. 

    If everything got worse after the flu, try Brucella Abortus Bang and
    Brucellosis. These Food Poisonings cause heavy flu symptoms. The Food P
    oisoning Bacteria could also be in the Kidneys.
   
    There is blood in the urine, but you do not know if it comes from the
    Kidneys or from the Bladder.
    If there is indeed no infection, you can also try the Heavy Metals.
    Especially Aluminium gives similar symptoms as Bladder Infection.

    Also the Bladder problems can give flu symptoms, since the Bladder meridian
    runs over the sinuses.

Asthma and Lower Back Pain

liselottewliselottew
September 2015 edited October 2015 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
37 yrs old man

Medical History:
Jaundice when he was born
Testicular Torsion left side (twisted spermatic cord) => as a child => did not
get surgery like his brothers who got it also 
Asthma => since he was 6 years old
Lower Back Pain => since he was in survival group in the military 17 years ago
(almost no food or sleep)
3 Prolapsed Discs over the years
Neck injury => at work 3 years ago (an iron pipe fell on his neck, he passed
out and was brought to the hospital) => Whiplash treatment given right after

Medication:
All vaccines that are custom in Sweden (incl. Anti-Tetanus and Polio)
Inhaler => every day when he was young, but now only when he has a cold, or has
been around animals

Environmental Circumstances:
Works in a factory => making the same movement all the time (Lifting up coolers
with a machine and moving them sideways. In assisting this movement he still
does some of the lifting) => makes the backache worse

Symptoms:
Asthma => sometimes => worse when around animals with fur
Lower backache => improved, feels like a weak electrical current
Headache => sometimes => top of the head, forehead
Lack of peristalsis (difficulty to pass stool) => but loose stool
Bloating stomach
Numbness => sometimes => mostly in the right toe, a little bit in the left toe
Itching Testicles (skin left side)
Irritated eyes in the morning => itchiness, redness, soreness, and white slime
in the eyes on waking up
Gets hot and sweaty much sooner than other people

Previous Treatments:
I have been treating him before, but stopped for a while
Symptoms improved, but are not completely gone

1st Session (not actual first session)

1st Measurement:
Hormone System - almost all points => Appendicitis Necroticans
Large Intestines => Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis, Tuberculinum,
Tuberculinum Bovinum, Diverticulose
Lymphatic System => Chronic Tonsillitis (corrected Lungs also)
Veins and Arteries => Barijodeel

Hand Treatment:

Hepar, Chelidonium

2nd Session

Changes in symptoms:
Lower back improved => can do more without pain
Cold symptoms one day => needed to use asthma spray => went away
Back stiffness => on waking up => hard to put socks on
Twisted/locked neck (hard to move his head to see to the side) => he rarely has
this symptom, this was the first time in months => happens sometimes when he is
lying on a pillow
Neck pain => right side (Gallbladder or Bladder meridian?)
Itching Testicles (right and left side)  
Allergic symptoms around animals => itchy eyes and nose, stuffy nose

Measurement:

Questions
1. There were no drops on the Skin points. What do you think causes the skin
itching on the testicles?
2. Do the symptoms and measurements match?
3. Can the opossum knob on the left side as a child, be caused by lack of
circulation and itching on skin on the left side of penis today?
4. Do you have any further recommendations?

    3rd Session
    Symptoms:
    Tiredness increased
    Allergic symptoms around animals => itchy eyes and nose, stuffy nose
    Minor asthma attack as usual
    Right now the skin of the genitals has red spots => symptoms became worse
    after visiting a spa

    History of Genital Symptoms:
    Several outbreaks the last 8 years
    Affected area itches and feels sore
    White, smelly discharge under foreskin
    Client suspected Herpes before
    I googled the symptoms and found it most likely to be a fungal infection
    (systemic candida)

    1st Measurement:
    Large Intestine => Appendicitis Necroticans

    Hand Treatment:
    Appendicitis Necroticans, Nux Vomica, Diarrheel, Diverticulose, Glyoxal,
    Mucosa, Populus, Solidago

    2nd Measurement:
    No drops 

    Footplate Treatment:
    Lymphomyosot, Hepar, Hepeel, Selenium, Berberis, Chelidonium, Inv. Fluor
    (own remedy, he uses fluor toothpaste)

    Questions
    5. There were only 3 drops on the Large Intestine meridian of the right
    hand. Could it be that all of his symptoms are caused by Appendicitis
    Necroticans or is his body maybe masking?
    6. Could it be that candida is a symptom of the inflammation in the Large
    Intestines? 
    7. Do you believe that partners can reinfect eachother with fungus/candida?
     
    8. Should I try to treat with Candida for symptom relieve until the Large
    Intestine is corrected?

    1. It is possible that there is Candida, but then this is caused by the
    Intestines 
    2. The symptoms do not completely match the measurements 
    3. A torsion is a structural issue that causes circulatory issues, but is 
    not caused by circulatory issues
    4. You need to first try to solve the Appendicitis and Diverticulosis, then
    repopulate the Intestines with Intestinal Flora, and only when this has
    been done will fungi like Candida or other Parasites disappear
    5. There are definitely not enough drops, since the symptoms are not all
    reflected in the measurement

    Symptoms and Indicated Systems
    Irritated eyes, Restricted neck movement, Bloating => Stomach issues
    Lower back problem => possible difference in leg length = Gallbladder (did
    you check this?)
    Bloating => Gallbladder (causing Stomach problems)
    Abnormal stools => likely caused by Large Intestine
    Itching => may be caused by Candida, but is also a symptom of Circulation
    issues
    Stiffness in the morning => lack of Circulation (likely caused by weak
    Adrenals => Selenium)

    6. Yes, it can be a symptom of an disturbed Intestinal Flora
    7. Partners can definitely infect each other with fungi or parasites
    8. You may try to treat with Candida but I do not know if it will help.
    Candida is a result of the absence of Intestinal Flora

    Thank you, verry helpfull to see the connection between symptoms and
    indicated systems. Could we make a new post where we collect a list of
    diffrent connections between symptoms and indicated systems? So that we
    also can write, if we get good advices in different cases? I would find
    this verry helpful. 
   
    I did check if there was a difference in leg length, but there was not. 
   
    I really take a lot of time to get proper measurements and try to do it as
    Johan has taught me.
   
    4th Session

    Changes in symptoms:
    Asthma => increased (when going to bed)
    Stool => easier to pass, but still loose 
    Eye discharge => increased (when waking up)
    Neck stiffness => did not come up, but does not come up that often
    Extreme headache on top of the head (Bladder meridian) => for 3 days after
    treatment
    Lower back pain/electricity => gone
    Lower back stiffness => on waking up   
    Penis symptoms => gone, except itching skin on testicles (you thought it to
    be a lack of Circulation from a structural problem?)
    Numbness big toe => feeling is back (did not feel irritated, which usually
    happens when there is numbness)
   
    Measurement:
    Large Intestine => Appendicitis Necroticans, Chronic Appendicitis
   
    >12 yrs Program:
    Appendicitis Necroticans, Chronic Appendicitis, Plantago, Selenium,
    Glyoxal, Diarrheel, Mucosa, Nux Vomica

    No drops
   
    Footplate Treatment:
    Appendicitis, Bact Coli, Bact Lactis, Bact Proteus, Bact Pyo,
    Diverticulose, Populus, Solidago, Candida Albicans
   
    Questions
    1. What may be the reason for the severe headache that lasted 3 days after
    treatment?
    2. What can I do differently to avoid this next time? He did drink a lot of
    water....
    3. There are still very few drops considering his symptoms, what can I do
    if masking is the cause?
    4. I think it was curious that the symptoms on his penis went away after
    treating with Appendicitis Necroticans. What is your explanation for this?

    Answers
    1. You did not treat with the Intestinal Flora Bacteria during the 3rd
    session. The headache is possibly caused by these bacteria affecting the
    Bladder system.
    2. When measurements are not reliable (too few drops, on too few systems)
    and there is the presence of Appendicitis, always use the Intestinal Flora
    and Bladder/Kidney support.
    3. It is more likely that you still press too hard. A similar pattern can
    be seen in your other sessions.
    4. I don't know. Most likely it is the cumulative effect of the Chiren
    treatments. You have treated him with the same Appendix remedies every time
    so you cannot say that Appendicitis Necroticans is what solved the issues.

    The measurement does not reflect the symptoms:
    Eye problems (at Stomach time) => Stomach issue
    Neck stiffness => Stomach issue
    Lower back stiffness => Gallbladder issue or Adrenal exhaustion
    Headache on top of the head => Bladder meridian, possibly caused by
    Intestinal Flora

    What did you measure on his Skin meridian?

    5th Session

    Changes in Symptoms:
    Stool => easy initiation, but the last 20% is difficult and takes time =>
    continues to feel the need "to go"
    Stool => slightly loose 
    Asthma every evening
    Headache => gone for 3 days after last session => then came back on top of
    the head and forehead

    1st Measurement:
    Kidneys => Bact Proteus
    Small Intestine => Duodenitis, Gastritis, Ulcus Duodeni
    Gallbladder => Billiary Cirrhosis
    Lungs => corrected by the above

    >12 yrs Program:
    Bact Proteus, Bact Lactis, Bact Coli, Bact Pyo, Duodenitis, Gastritis,
    Ulcus Duodeni, Billiary Cirrhosis

    2nd Measurement:
    Liver => Zirrhose Hepatis
    Stomach => Corrected by the nosode above

    Footplate Treatment:
    Zirrhose Hepatis, Solidago, Nux Vomica, Mucosa, Hepar, Chelidonium,
    Diarrheel, Duodenoheel
   
    About my measurements:
    I really take my time to make sure the measurements are right. When I press
    the probe, I press very lightly now. The graph never goes higher then 50%
    of the measurement screen. Often it just goes above the first line from the
    bottom.
    After measuring I always look at the screen to be sure, and since there is
    always a straight line I believe that I don't change the pressure while
    measuring a point. 
   
    Questions
    1. Is my understanding, that you need to treat with all 4 Intestinal Flora
    Bacteria when you measure Appendicitis Necroticans right? I read that
    somewhere...
    2. Should the measurement always mirror the symptoms? Is it not possible
    that the body is masking things and will show issues later when it
    improves?
    3. If not I misunderstand the idea of peeling layers in treatment. I
    thought that the causes behind symptoms reveal themselves over time in the
    measurement. Can you explain?
    4. Do symptoms and measurement relate better in this 5th session? There is
    no neck stiffness at the moment.
    5. What other possible reasons can cause the measurement issue?
    6. I have measured the Skin meridian, but it does not drop. But I thought
    that you mentioned earlier that the itching Skin on the balls may be caused
    by a structural issue from the earlier torsion? And then it cannot be
    treated right?

    6th Session 
    Symptoms:
    Asthma => when lying in bed (not only at bedtime) => sleeps on spirals, but
    does not want to get rid of it because this mattress feels best for his
    lower back
    Gass => almost gone
    Loose stools => gone
    Difficulty passing stool => gone
    Headache => gone for 3 days => came back on top of the head
    Lower back stiffness on waking up => better
    White slime in eyes on waking up => still present
   
    1st Measurement:
    Large Intestine (R) - 4 points => Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis,
    Diverticulose

    Erigotheel, Glyoxal
   
    Comments:
    The fact that I did not measure any drops on the Large Intestine last week,
    but today I measured Chronic Appendicitis, makes me think I overlooked this
    the previous session.
    However, I must have done something right, since some of his symptoms
    improved. 
   
    Question
    8. Is it possible that the Appendix goes from being OK last week, to being
    chronically inflamed this week?
   
    9. Is it possible that the asthma and the headache on top of the head are
    caused by Intestinal Flora Bacteria causing infections elsewhere in the
    body (caused by the Appendix)?

    1. When there is any form of Appendicitis you can check the whole body for
    the 4 Intestinal Flora Bacteria, because there is a likelihood that
    bacteria have escaped from the Large Intestine. IF you measure one of the
    Intestinal Flora Bacteria elsewhere, it is indeed necessary to treat with
    all 4, since it is unlikely that only the one escaped.
    It is however not the time to use these remedies to reintroduce them to the
    Large Intestine, since the climate there is still not good due to the
    Appendicitis.

    2. In most cases the symptoms can be seen in the measurements. Suppression
    is possible, but is not as common as you might think.
    Liver suppression is normal, we see this a lot. Suppression of the other
    systems is very unusual. Suppression of Yang organs is extremely rare. So
    suppression in other organ systems than the Liver does happen, but it is
    exceptional. When it does happen, however, it means that this specific
    organ system is under a tremendous amount of stress.

    Endorphin mask is something different, because this is a temporary
    condition where no drop at all is measured. This happens when the whole
    body has been put under stress (e.g. exercise), or when substances are used
    that have a similar effect as the body's own pain killers (e.g. morphine).

    3. There is no peeling of layers in the meridians that show up, but in the 
    disturbances that you measure on the imbalanced meridians (e.g. the Large
    Intestine drops and is corrected with Appendicitis, the next session the
    same organ system drops again but now the next layer shows up which, for
    example, is Diverticulosis).
    On the dropping points -which should correlate with the symptoms- we
    measure only the most dominant disturbance. If this disturbance has been
    removed, then the underlying layer or the next phase of healing of the
    affected organ system will show.

    4. There are again discrepancies between measurement and symptoms.
    a) There seems to be a problem with the stool. I do not see drops on the
    Large Intestine.
    ​b) I can hardly imagine Lungs that come in order by the remedies that you
    used.
    c) Headache on the forehead still indicates Stomach.
    d) I suggest you also use Bladder remedies because of the headache on top
    of the head

    5. I have no idea what is the cause of the measurement issue. If it is not
    you, there are two possibilities:
    a) It still is suppression or
    b) It might be an environmental issue, something in the measurement
    environment

    6. I do not think that itching is a structural issue, I think you
    misinterpreted my suggestion that Circulation may be a possible cause. If
    it is not the Skin, then it might be an allergic reaction to a laundry
    detergent or something like this, or a problem of the local Circulation.​
    But Circulatory issues are usually not structural.
   
    Other comments
    Liver remedies should not be used during this stage of treatment. The yang
    organs, but especially the Kidneys were not OK during initial measurements.

    8. It is possible that the Appendix goes from being OK to being acutely
    inflamed but not to chronically inflamed. So I agree, that this has not
    been measured well.

    9. This maybe true for the headache on top of the head (Bladder infected
    with Intestinal Bacteria). But, although theoretically possible, it is
    unlikely that the Intestinal Flora Bacteria cause Lung problems. I have
    never seen this. 
    Also, why would you abandon the observation that his asthma comes up when
    lying on a bed with spirals? I suggest he tries to sleep on an airbed to
    test the theory that the spirals are a problem. If he does not notice any
    difference, he can continue to sleep in the same bed. But if he does notice
    a difference you will know you won't be able to help him with the symptoms
    that are caused by the spirals until he changes mattresses... The cause
    always needs to be removed. 

    His lower back problem is likely caused by the Gallbladder and/or
    Circulation.

    1. From another forum post I understood to always use the 4 Intestinal
    Flora Bacteria whenever measuring Appendicitis Necroticans. It said that a
    necrotic Appendix creates such a bad climate that the bacteria often spread
    to places they don't belong. I am now a bit confused about this...
   
    3. This is new information to me, and very educational
   
    5a. What can I do in the situation that there is still suppression? Can I
    do something different to somehow lift the suppression?
   
    5b. What environmental issues can disturb the measurement? Is it a problem
    to have chairs and a table that have steel (metal) parts? Can a rug cause
    problems?
   
    6. The client was using fabric softener a lot, but now said he would stop.

    9. The itching of his eyes and nose happens mainly when he is around
    animals. 
    The asthma occurs when he is in contact with animals, but also at times
    when he is not.
    This is why I suspect that something else is causing the asthma. He only
    recently started experiencing asthma when going to bed. Maybe it is just
    the position of his body, lying down, that makes breathing more difficult.
    Do you think that the spirals in his bed may cause asthma? I will look into
    that.

    1. Normally I use all Intestinal Flora Bacteria, since it they might sit
    anywhere. What was said, however, is the purpose of using the Flora nosodes
    cannot be to reintroduce them to the Intestines. And if another focus is
    needed, and you did not measure any of them, you can choose not to use them
    then. They do take up a lot of space.
   
   
    5a-5b-6-9. From all that is happening I get the impression there must be a
    major stress factor. He has allergies when animals are in his environment,
    and his body produces endorphins. Behind the allergies there always is a
    basic cause because the mucous membranes are already irritated and the
    allergen creates an over reaction of his body.

    A rug can pose a environmental problem in the measuring if it causes static
    electricity. The metal in chairs can cause Spin Inversion or at least
    create a strong magnetic field. But sometimes a magnetic field is created
    in the environment by the positions of electric sockets, dimmers, heating
    radiators. 
    Perhaps there is a fungus in the air.

    I would make a remedy of the laundry detergents and see if they react on
    his body. If necessary treat with it.
    The fact that he experiences asthma when going to bed might also be caused
    by the time he goes to bed. if he goes to bed between 11 pm and 1 am, the
    cause might be the Gallbladder.
   
    You suggested the spirals in his bed yourself, and since they may
    contribute to Spin Inversion you may have to look into this.

    There are many possibilities and they need to be researched and eliminated
    one by one.

    1. That is very educational, thank you. 

    5a-5b-6-9. I agree, but I do not measure any drops on the Lungs. 
    I do not see what the cause of the stress (that leads to endorphins) could
    be and how to solve this problem.

    About the environment:
    There are no heaters in, or close to the room. 
    The room is on the second floor
    There are no dimmers. 
    The room has 3 electric outlets. 
    I swopped the metal chairs for wood ones, and removed the rug.
    The house was checked for fungus, and there are no dangerous fungi in the
    basement itself. However, a year ago we stored some wood too close to the
    wall, that did contain fungus. We moved the wood...

    He indeed goes to bet between 11 pm and 1 am. 
    Yesterday he had an asthma attack when he was laughing a lot. Right before
    going to bed, around 10-11 pm.

    Questions
    1. How do you check if power outlets are bad?
    2. Is sheepskin on the floor OK, so my clients won't get cold feet?
    3. When there is fungus in the air, how do I treat this?
    4. Can fungus from the basement travel up to the second floor? 
    5. How can asthma be caused by the Gallbladder system?

    Answers
    1. The power outlets can only be checked by a meter that checks magnetic
    and electrical fields

    2. Sheepskin should be Ok, but it also collects a lot of dust which can
    trigger asthma as well

    3. Fungus can only be in the air if it is on the walls or floor. If there
    are no heaters in the room, the room must be cold and humidity might be
    high, excellent conditions for fungi and also an excellent condition for
    asthma. Perhaps it might be a good idea to warm up the room so that there
    is not such a big temperature difference.
    To remove/kill fungi in the air you may try using air-ionizers. 

    4. Fungus can travel anywhere where the conditions are right: humidity and
    lack of air circulation. 

    5. Asthma is caused by the Gallbladder because the airways can suddenly be
    restricted. Contraction is always a Gallbladder problem. Laughing also
    causes an asthma attack, which also indicates internal tension. 
    It might not be measurable because it is a temporary symptom that only
    occurs at specific circumstances.

    There is a heater downstairs, but the doors are open end the heat rises up.
    The temperature upstairs is around 20 degrees Celsius and about 23 degrees
    downstairs. The house is old so there is a lot of air circulation. The
    client will install an ionizer to see if it makes a difference.

    I will test the cleaning powder and change the bed after the focus on the
    Galbladder, so I will know what gives what effect.

    7th Session
    Symptoms:
    Red spots penis (underneath foreskin) + itching => after intercourse =>
    candida symptoms
    Itching scrotum
    Lower back => pain gone => now stiffness => Gallbladder?
    Circulation problem => blood vessel cramping (Gallbladder)?
    Intestinal issues => are solved now
    Swollen/inflamed gums => Stomach meridian
    Asthma => bedtime (11pm) => Gallbladder?
    Headache (forehead) => Stomach
    Stomach bloating (gas) => Gallbladder
    Teeth grinding => at night => Gallbladder
    Respiratory allergies (animals) => eye redness/irritation, runny nose,
    sneezing => mucous membranes irritated by something else => possibly
    Stomach/mouth issues?
    Eye discharge => when waking up => Stomach

    1st Measurement:
    Stomach (L) - 3rd point from nail - Campylobacter Pylori
    Liver (L+R) - 3rd point from nail - Zirrhose Hepatis

    >12 yrs Program:
    Campylobacter Pylori, Billiary Cirrhosis, Cholecystitis

    2nd Measurement:
    Stomach (L) - 3rd point from nail => Calculi Bil, Adenomyose Gallenblase
    Gallbladder (L) - 3 points => Calculi Bil, Adenomyose Gallenblase

    No more Liver drops after >12 yrs Treatment

    Footplate Treatment:
    Calculi Bil, Calculi Renalis, Adenomyose Gallenblase, Reneel Berberis,
    Spascupreel, Solidago, Populus

    Questions
    A. I did not treat the Liver because the yang organs was not cleared yet.
    Instead I added Galbladder nosodes because he has a lot of Galbladder
    symptoms, and the Galbladder disturbs the Stomach. Was this the right
    decision?

    B. I tested again with all nosodes that were used in the hand treatment,
    but the Liver was still dropping.
    How is it then possible that the Liver was corrected in the 2nd
    measurement?

    C. Do the symptoms and measurement/treatment match? 

    D. Are the correlations between symptoms and causes that I wrote down
    right? 

    E. When measuring someone else, if my finger touches the measuring probe
    (e.g. holding my thumb under the probe to stabilise it), does this effect
    the measurement?

    F. What can be the cause of the itching and red spots on the penis after
    intercourse? Why do you think it happens after intercourse? I have read
    that Candida can be there without being visible. The friction during
    intercourse then may cause irritation and a flare up. He does not have
    intestinal issues anymore, so maybe he gets it from the partner?

    A. It was a correct decision to treat the Gallbladder primarily. But you
    could have used Gallbladder support remedies also.

    B. You only test the effect of the remedy. When you run a program, there is
    also a correction from the light treatment itself. 

    C. There are not enough points dropping to match with the symptoms.

    E. Yes, this will effect your measurement.

    F. Yes, that is a possibility.

    A. I forgot to read it down, but used Chelidonium, Injeel Chol, Atropinum,
    Nux Vomica in the hand treatment.

    C. Could it be because he has bad Circulation, bad sound on feet and hands
    that I get too few drops? I have used the 2-7 year program without
    remedies. Does it effect the messurment if I have a normal lightbulb
    hanging from the roof. It hangs close to the pacient. 


    8th Session
    Changed Symptoms:
    Swollen/inflamed gums => gone
    Asthma around bed time => almost gone (only a little bit the last days)
    Stomach bloating (gas) => much better
    Red spots penis => gone

    Unchanged Symptoms:
    Itching scrotum => same 
    Low back stiffness => same
    Headache forehead => one day/same intensity
    Teeth grinding/clenching => unknown
    Respiratory allergies (animals) => unknown (no contact with animals)
    Eye discharge on waking up => same

    Measurement difficulties:
    Circulation problems => 2-7 yrs program without remedies => little
    improvement => hand treatment => easier to measure on the hands, but still
    cold feet with low sounds

    1st Measurement:
    Stomach (L) => Salmonella Typhi
    Gallbladder (L) => Calculi Bil, Billiary Cirrhosis, Cholecystitis

    >12 yrs Program:
    Salmonella Typhi, Calculi Bil, Calculi Renales, Billiary Cirrhosis,
    Adenymoyose Gallenblase, Cholecystitis, Chelidonium, Atropinum
   
    2nd Measurement:
    No drops
   
    Footplate Treatment:
    Injeel Chol, Berberis, Nux Vomica, Mucosa, Solidago, Populus, Spascupreel,
    Selenium
   
    Questions
    1. I do not understand why the red spots on penis disappeard after last
    treatment, although he still had intercourse. Any idea why this is?
   
    2. Can the itching scrotum be caused by cramping blood vessels (bad
    circulation) because of an unbalanced Galbladder?
   
    3. Can this (bad circulation because of blood vessel cramping) also be the
    cause of the measurement problems (low sounds, too few drops)

    1. & 2. I have no idea. I have no experience with these symptoms, so I do
    not know if the nosode treatment did this or the support treatment

    3. Bad Circulation is a cause of low sounds, but not for too few drops,
    unless the low sounds make you press too hard causing you to press "through
    the point".

    The scrotum is the place where Liver and Kidney meridians join (above) and
    run through (under Liver meridian). I suspect a Liver issue (itching), that
    does not allow Gallbladder to heal fully.

    The 8th session did not differ that much from the 7th session (as far as I
    can see Mucosa was the only remedy that was not used in the 7th session,
    but was in the 8th), so you will not be able to know what exactly made the
    change. Most likely it is just the overall detoxification and healing that
    took some time to become visible, and now the scale has tipped and the
    healing of his Skin symptoms sets in... 
    Just continue your treatments, symptoms are clearing one by one, so you are
    on the right track.

    I treated him for symptoms last week, before I read these comments.

    Changes in Symptoms:
    Asthma => gone
    Itching scrotum => same
    Lower back pain => only stiff now => same
    Headache (forehead) => gone
    Stomach bloating => more (changed diet, by including smoothies 2 times
    daily)
    Teeth grinding/clenching => unknown
    Respiratory allergies (animals) => gone
    Eye discharge on waking up => same
    Measurement difficulties =>Circulation problems => 2-7 years program
    without remedies => little improvement => hand treatment => easier to
    measure on the hands, but still cold feet with low sounds

    Because of neck stiffness one day, and because I had no energy to measure
    him, I treated him according to symptoms with focus on the Stomach and
    Gallbladder.

    9th Session (Symptom Treatment)

    >12 years Program:
    Calculi Bil, Calculi Renalis, Cholecystitis, Biliary Cirrhosis, Adenomyose
    Gallenblase, Ulcus Ventriculi, Gastritis, Chelidonium

    10th Session

    More symptoms => I just symptoms treated last time, because I was too tired
    to treat

    Symptom Changes:
    Asthma => still gone
    Respiratory allergies (animals) => still gone
    Itching scrotum => same
    Lower back stiffness => same
    Headache (forehead) => increased
    Stomach bloating => more, but he changed his diet by including smoothies 2
    times daily

    Eye discharge on waking up => same

    Returning Symptoms (did not show for some time until now):
    Neck and shoulder stiffness (day 2) => went away
    Swollen gums => almost gone

    New Symptom:
    More tired 

    Measurement difficulties =>Circulation problems => 2-7 years program
    without remedies to get beter measurement.

    1st Measurement (still low sounds, pressed light when measuring anyway):
    Stomach (L) => Ulcus Ventriculi, Gastritis
    Gallbladder (L) => Pfeiffer (no common Gallbladder nosodes matched)

    >12 Years Program:
    Ulcus Ventriculi, Gastritis, Pfeiffer, Injeel Chol, Chelidonium, Hepar,
    Hepeel, Atropinum

    2nd Measurement:
    No drops
    Gallbladder still low sounds, other meridians have higher sounds now

    Footplate Treatment:
    Galium, Gastricumheel, Erigotheel, Nux Vomica, Mucosa, Solidago,
    Lymphomyosot, Anacardium

    3rd Measurement:
    No drops
    Gallbladder still low sounds

    Comments:
    I measured Pfeiffer (Liver nosode) on the Gallbladder this session =>
     Symptom (tiredness) and measurement (Pfeiffer) seem to match

    Questions
    1. There are several reasons for suspecting that the Liver meridian could
    be the cause for bad Circulation in the area (scrotum itch, lower back
    stiffness):
    A. Because I measured Liver remedies on the Gallbladder meridian
    B. Because of the location of the Liver meridian
    C. Because of the cramping of muscles in this area
    D. Because these symptoms were not affected by treating the Gallbladder in
    recent sessions
    Is this correct reasoning?

    2. Why do you think did he get so many more symptoms after I treated him
    for symptoms last time without measuring?
    * Suppression?
    * The body taking care of old problems (like cold symptoms after treating
    with Strep or Staph)?

    3. When I read that clients should have no stronger reactions than some
    tiredness and maybe a slight headache (easily resolved by drinking water),
    I got a bit confused. Did I do something wrong?

    4. Is it not possible that the body shows more symptoms after treatment
    because it was masking, or because the immune system starts clearing up old
    infections?
   
    5. The measurements on the Gallbladder still had low sounds after the hand
    treatment. Does this tell you something about the reliability of the
    measurements? Should I have done something about this?

    I think the tiredness is caused by two things:
   
    a. A lot of energy is used after the session for processing information and
    repairing
   
    b. A Liver that does not function optimally causes exhaustion. Measuring
    Liver remedies on the Gallbladder without the Liver showing drops, means
    that the Liver is too stressed to show itself.

    When there are no drops on the Liver, but Liver nosodes correct Gallbladder
    drops, I would continue to treat with support remedies for Gallbladder and
    Kidneys.
    I would also pay attention to the Circulation (Circulo, Placenta,
    Lymphomyosot).

    Because of the suppression/stress, I would choose a gentle approach by
    lowering/releasing pressure. Depending on the client, I use 2-3 nosodes for
    each session.

    Also, if I have measured a nosode on the Liver when determining the
    condition of the Liver, I remove this nosode from the list and try support
    remedies to see which one is the best choice for the body at this moment.

    Recovery depends on how much energy the body has to do repair in between
    sessions. It takes physical time to repair physical body.

    About paying attention to the Circulation:
    I focussed the support on the meridians I treated (Stomach, Gallbladder,
    Liver)
    If I would support with Circulation remedies (Lymphomyosot, Circulo,
    Placenta), then there is less space to focus support on the organs
    treated...

    Questions
    6. Should I still use the Circulation support? 
   
    7. I do not understand your suggestion to "determine the condition of the
    Liver, and then remove the nosode from the list to find a matching support
    ". I have never heard/read this before. Is it in line with Johan
    Boswinkel's protocols? 

    I thought we were supposed to read about the support remedies and add the
    one that matched the symptoms/situation the most.

    To Liselotte:
    I think your posts are incredibly helpful in understanding Biontology. 
    Your questions and Johan's answers shed much light on the process.  I've
    learned that you can put nosodes in both the hand and foot treatments. 
    I've also understood the use of the second measure in relationship to this
    possibility.  So, if you don't use all the eight possible nosode slots in
    the first reading you can use the second reading to do so.  This allows for
    a strategy that may benefit the patient in the healing process.  Thanks

    1. In theory it may be the Liver meridian that is causing the itching, but
    I have never found this to be the case with skin conditions.

    You mentioned before that the condition always starts/gets worse after
    intercourse. This looks more like a situation of re-infection or renewed
    irritation because of friction caused by te intercourse. These are all
    things you have to consider.

    To find out if it is one of these things, you must find out by deduction,
    i.e. to refrain from having intercourse for a while, and at the same time
    continue treatment. 

    Because his sexual partner also has similar - but vaginal - issues, it is
    likely it is very possible it is something like this. 

    2. That symptoms get worse in number or gets worse in severity can come
    because of previous suppression.
    The two reasons that you mention are really the same. It is really possible
    that existing conditions suddenly come out in symptoms, that is because
    they were suppressed.

    3.&4. The lifting of suppression is going to happen even without putting
    nosodes in at all. But there is an important difference between an
    over-reaction to treatment and the lifting of suppression. 

     When there is suppression there is no symptom while you can already
    measure that there is a problem with a certain organ system (drops), and
    only after treatment the symptoms will appear. But this should not be a
    severe reaction.

    An example is when you measure drops on the Lymphatic System and Lungs, and
    you measure for example Staph, but there are no symptoms. Then, the day
    after treatment (with or without actually using the Staph nosode), all of a
    sudden the client gets cold symptoms. This is a natural immune response to
    something that is already there, and not a stress response of a body that
    was over-treated. 

    5. The low sounds can have a number of reasons. The Skin can be harder, the
    local Circulation cannot be good, the pressure could be too low for the
    specific points. I cannot answer this from here. 

    6. The Circulation support should consist of Adrenal support. This often is
    also a reason for fatigue and exhausted adrenal glands are often a reason
    for gallbladder/liver issues.

    7. This method is not part of my protocol. I never do this, because it does
    not make sense. 
    The Liver might react on a particular support at this time but that is 
    before the cause has been removed and not after when the nosode is applied
    that can actually correct the Liver. 
     Also trying to match something on the Liver is still focussing on the
    Liver. This is diverting the energy away from your organ systems of focus
    and should not be done. The Liver should be left alone completely (no
    nosodes, and no supports) until it is time to focus on it.

    The red spots and pain under the foreskin was what became worse after
    intercourse, but this is gone for a while now (even when having
    intercourse).

    The itching of the scrotum is there all the time, independently from having
    intercourse.
    He often has cold testicles, so I figure there must be a circulatory issue.

    Thank you for clearing up my confusion about question 7.

    Questions
    1. Is it possible that the scrotum itch and cold testicles are caused by
    the Liver meridian causing muscle cramping?

    2. My question 6. was about whether I should follow Yelena's advice to use
    Circulation support, eventhough my focus is on the Stomach and Gallbladder
    now.
    You answered that I should use Adrenal support for this case, but the
    Adrenal Glands are not dropping.

    3. You wrote to leave the Liver alone... But the Gallbladder was only
    corrected by a Liver nosode (Pfeiffer), and since the Stomach is controlled
    by the Gallbladder I thought I needed to treat with it. Should I not have
    treated that at this stage?

    4. There were no drops on the Liver, but because the a Liver nosode was
    measured on the Gallbladder meridian, I thought this meant that it is
    really the Liver that affects the Gallbladder, so I decided to treat with
    Liver support remedies. Was this wrong reasoning?

    Clarification
    1. You confuse two things:
    1. The possibility for local symptoms at the location of a meridian, and
    2. The systemic cramping that a Liver/Gallbladder condition can cause

    Meridian Symptoms
    A. Symptoms at the meridian location caused by dysfunction of the connected
    organ are:
    Nerve pain, Headache, Muscle ache, and Stiffness along the meridian pathway

    B. Symptoms caused by a blockage on a meridian pathway (scar) are:
    Numbness and Paralysis along the meridian pathway after the blockage
    Sensitivity, Pain and Redness on the meridian pathway before the blockage

    Organ System Symptoms
    A. Symptoms caused by dysfunction of systemic functions that are controlled
    by a specific Organ System. Systemic functions can give symptoms anywhere
    in the body and are not limited to the meridian pathway. For example:

    * Gallbladder dysfunction => leads to muscle cramping => leads to bad
    circulation (narrowing of vessels)
    This muscle cramping or bad circulation can show up anywhere in the body

    * Kidney dysfunction => leads to uric acid (or other toxic) build up =>
    leads to rheumatic/arthritic symptoms
    These deposits are not limited to locations near the Kidney meridian, and
    and can show up in tissues/joints throughout the body

    B. Symptoms at the actual location of the physical organs connected to an
    Organ System. For example:

    * Inflammation of the Bladder => gives burning urination / Bladder pain

    * Inflammation of the Large Intestine & Intestinal Flora issues =>
    Constipation

    2. Because there are no drops on the Circulatory System, and not a specific
    pressing reason to use Circulatory support, you are right to not divert
    from your focus, and use the space for the Organ Systems of your focus.
    Johan advised to use Selenium because exhausted Adrenals are often behind
    Gallbladder/Liver issues, and because your client experienced fatigue.

    The questions will be answered by Johan later

    Answers
    1. It is unlikely that cramping of the blood vessels causes the cold
    testicles and the itching. This is not a meridian problem, but most likely
    a fungal or candida infection. While you are working on the underlying
    causes, he should try to wear loose cotton underwear and keep his scrotum
    cool and dry - and preferably not have sex - because fungus thrives in a
    warm and moist climate.

    In theory the Liver (the system and not the meridian location) can be
    behind itching, but then it would not be localised like it is now, and
    there would be itching on other places too. The itching that is caused by
    Liver and Kidney disease comes from build-up of toxins in the tissues, and
    is not limited to one location.

    The fact that the more extreme expressions (redness/pain) of the skin
    infection have cleared, does not mean that it has been cleared completely.
    A fungal infection does not always have to be visible to cause itching.

    2. Circulation is not a system that you are focusing on right now, so it is
    better to use support on those Organ systems that you do treat.
    When the Adrenal glands are not dropping that does not always mean that
    they are working sufficiently. It means that they are capable but it does
    not mean that they are doing it. Whether they function also depends on the
    availability of the right nutrients, and with his digestive issues it is
    likely he does not digest/absorb well.

    3. & 4. Ulcers and Gastritis can, indeed, be caused by the Gallbladder or
    Liver in case of continued stress. But other reasons cannot be discounted.

    If, after so many sessions, a Liver nosode is measured on the Gallbladder,
    and the Kidneys are clear and there are not that many drops anymore in
    general, I would assume that enough detox has taken place already to safely
    treat with this nosode.

    However, the situation is very strange. So many treatments have been done,
    that the Liver should not suppress anymore. Normally the Liver starts
    showing itself not later than the 7th session. If it doesn't this indicates
    that hardly any detox has taken place, but this is not the situation with
    your client.
    The fact that the Liver showed up in previous treatments means that there
    should not be that much suppression. So in this case, normally Liver
    nosodes that are measured on the Gallbladder should also show up on Liver
    drops. Pfeiffer is, however, not a specific Liver nosode. It is a virus
    infection, and possibly only the Gallbladder is affected by it, and not the
    Liver.


    Advice
    Apart from keeping the testicles dry and cool (because of the fungal
    infection), my recommendation is to start focusing completely on the Liver
    now. This is possible because:

    * This client has been treated many times, even before you even started
    writing down sessions on the forum.

    * The exit channels seem to be clear.

    * Kidneys and Large Intestine do not drop anymore, and most of the other
    organs seem to be functioning.

    * There are no severe symptoms that point to Kidney or Liver malfunction

    * The only drops measured now, are on Stomach and Gallbladder, and both may
    be affected by the condition of the Liver.

    If there still are no drops on the Liver, you can give the following
    session:

    >12 Years Program:
    Zirrhose Hepatis, Hepatitis A non B, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis A, Pfeiffer,
    Galium, Hepar, Hepeel

    Footplate Treatment:
    Berberis, Selenium, Populus, Solidagio, Reneel, Sabal, Cantharis, Plantago

    I will tell him to do so. Very educational and so much fun to learn new
    things.

    11th Session

    Symptom Changes:
    Asthma => one small attack => when laughing in a room with animals (which
    used to create severe asthma attacks)
    Itching scrotum => same
    Lower back stiffness => more => now on bottom => going down in his left leg
    Headache (forehead) => gone
    Stomach bloating => gone
    Teeth grinding/clenching (night) => unknown
    Eye discharge on waking up => same
    Swollen gums => same
    Tired => same

    Treatment:
    2-7 years blank program for better circulation

    1st Measurement:
    Still very low sounds. I gave up measuring after I finished the hands. It
    was too exhausting to continue, because the sounds were so low and not
    pressing too hard (through the drops) seemed impossible. I figured the
    measurement would not be reliable anyway.
    I did measure the Liver, but there were no drops.

    >12 yrs Program (as advised above):
    Zirrhose Hepatis, Hepatitis A non B, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis A, Pfeiffer,
    Galium, Hepar, Hepeel

    2nd Measurement:
    No drops, but higher sounds, which made it easy to measure.

    Footplate Treatment (as advised above):
    Berberis, Selenium, Populus, Solidagio, Reneel, Sabal, Cantharis, Plantago

    Questions
    1. Do you mean that a possible underlying cause of the Candida could be
    that the bad Liver weakens the immune system?

    2. I thought that the Liver meridian can create local muscle cramping, and
    since the Liver meridian is close to the testicles it could cause the
    Circulation in that area to become worse. Is this not correct then?

    3. I have read that coconut oil helps agains candida, is that correct?

    4. What if his girlfriend has Pfeiffer too? Pfeiffer can spread through
    saliva. Should he maybe not kiss or drink from the same glass as her then?
    And do they need to be treated at the same time then?

    5. Bad Circulation caused by blood vessel cramping (Gallbladder System),
    can be the cause for the low sounds and difficult measurement, am I right?
    Measuring became much easier after treating the Liver. Could this be
    because the Liver System affects the Gallbladder System, making the blood
    vessels cramp? 

    6. The blank 2-7 years program before the 1st measurement did not improve
    the measurement much.. Is the measurement reliable during the 1st
    measurement when it is so hard to get sounds? 

    7. If I encounter a similar situation like this again, is there anything
    else that I can do to get a clearer sound the 1st measurement?

    1. No, I do not think the Liver is the cause underlying the Candida.
    Candida is a fungus that belongs in the Intestines. I believe that the main
    cause that underlies the excessive Candida growth is an unfavourable
    climate in the Intestines, normally caused by infections.
    The Liver problems might also be a result of the issues in the Large
    Intestine.

    2. Muscle cramping is normally the result of an issue of the Gallbladder
    system, not of the Liver.

    3. I have no experience with this.

    4. Pfeiffer is also called the kissing disease and it seems to be
    contagious. The girlfriend should be checked as well for Pfeiffer. But in
    our system Pfeiffer normally shows up rather late in the sessions.

    5. The relaxation of the Circulation comes normally after ANY treatment, it
    does not come because of treating the Liver. The Gallbladder issues could
    however be caused by the Liver.

    6. & 7. The short treatment is really too short to have much of an effect
    as far as relaxation is concerned. What helps me a lot is if I make the
    golden rod very wet

    I have been treating a patient for Parkinson's and I notice that when I
    first measure her, she is not in Spin Inversion. 
    I then do the Scar Treatment on her Tummy Tuck Scar across her Abdomen and
    then once I start to load up the remedies on her Triple Warmer etc., she
    starts to Spin. 
    Does this relate to the Scar Treatment, do you think? It has happened the
    last two times.

    Sometimes Scars can be so disturbing that Endorphins are created by the
    body that Mask the Imbalances. When after Scar treatment the Endorphin Mask
    is lifted you can find drops again. And probably your Client is in Spin
    Inversion all the time....

    Did she only have a Tummy Tuck or also a Liposuction? Liposuction is
    unbelievably damaging to the abdomen... it can cause Adhesions and Internal
    Scar Tissue. Do you use Procrainium too, or do you only treat the Scar
    externally?

    You are right, she had some liposuction too, but on her thighs. I have used
    Procrainum on the tummy tuck scars, but only once. I will use it each time
    from now on. 
    Interesting connection to Spin Inversion. She cleared her bedroom of all
    disturbances, but it didn't make a difference because I found it again, so
    it must relate more to this. If the liposuction left "hole-type" scars on
    her thighs, how should I approach those?

    The Spin Inversion is not directly related to de Scar, but I think the
    Endorphins produced because of the Scars might have Masked it. It was
    already there....

    So appart from her bedroom there might be another Environmental Cause that
    you need to address.

    The hole-type Scars I would just treat with normal Scar Treatment and use
    Procrainum (because of the internal damage done there).

    Karolina, do you mean the orange/blue items when refering to normal
    scartreatment .

    Is it correct that you can add remedies also with these, and not only via
    the fiberoptic rolls?

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    April 2013 edited January 2014 Flag
    Since for Internal Scars you need to use a Remedy (Procranium), I would use
    the Glass Rods. Then you are certain that all Information, and not only
    part of it, is transmitted to the body. The blue/orange wires only transmit
    Lower Frequencies. 
    Also the metal wires, don't penetrate the Skin very deep.

    When you use Scar Treatment to treat actual Scars you should not use any
    Remedies. But sometimes the Scar Treatment is used locally for the
    treatment of certain Symptoms and then you can use a Remedy. (e.g.
    Variolinum to treat Shingles locally) Don't overdo this and choose the one
    or two Remedies that make the most sense to use. 

    Remember that you are offering new Information to the Body in this way too
    and that they add up to everything you have used or are going to use on the
    Hand and Footplate Treatment. Less is more...

    Can anyone suggest the best remedies for skin cancer on the face, and
    should one use the glass rods or the scar wires/pads for this? I heard that
    simply putting the blue light directly on the cancer or scar would work
    great. If you have cancer above the mouth in that soft area between the
    mouth and the nose (not in the middle), is there a correlation to an area
    in the body in Chinese medicine? Does Johan suggest the use of any of those
    skin salves that are good for skin cancer, or does he think that one should
    see a dermatologist and have it removed surgically or 'frozen' off? Thank

September 2015 - Spin Inversion vs Aura Weakness

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
September 2015 edited September 2015 in Q&A Flag
Question

I know which point indicates a Spin Inversion and that all points dropping
sharply indicate a Weak Aura. Could you please answer some questions about the
differences in a Spin Inversion and a depleted Aura and their treatment?
Whenever I cannot find anything during the assessment phase that matches, I run
a Spin Inversion program followed by a 2-7 program with Ozaliet, Selenium and
Berberis. This sometimes helps.

Answer

Before I continue with the more specific questions that will follow about this
subject I would like to comment on what was written here.
You state: “Whenever I cannot find anything during the assessment phase that
matches, I run a Spin Inversion program followed by a 2-7 program with Ozaliet,
Selenium and Berberis. This sometimes helps.”
There are a lot of observational mistakes in this. If you have drops and you
cannot find anything that matches, it is the measurement of the points itself
that is a problem. The response you have by giving some random treatments like
Spin Inversion and a 2-7 program with Ozaliet, Selenium and Berberis shows that
you do not assess the problem right because:
A. If it was Spin Inversion there would be either steep drops on the Spin
Inversion points, or in case of a Hidden Spin Inversion there would be a normal
picture of drops that you will find remedies for but do not respond in
treatment. Neither of these two options applied because the problem was not
being able to find remedies matching, which is a whole different problem
altogether.
B. If it was an Aura problem, then there would be steep drops on many points
that would respond in MEASUREMENT with Ozaliet. This also is not the case in
your example, so there is no use in running this remedy in this case.
C. If nothing matches, it is also very unlikely that with Adrenal support like
Berberis and Selenium suddenly you find things that do match.

So we can conclude that all of the approaches you thought are causing an
improved measurement in some cases are a misinterpretation of what really
happens.
What in fact happened is that you had difficulty getting a proper measurement
because of bad Circulation, and due to the relaxing effect of the Chiren
treatment, that normally takes place, Circulation improved and measurement
became easier. It was the general light treatment that did the trick and not
the remedies.
It is very important that you understand this, because misinterpretation of
what happens causes a lot of “mythology” around biophoton treatment. Just
treating without remedies would most likely have been sufficient.

So now I will continue with the more specific questions about Spin Inversion
and Aura Weakness.

    Questions

    1 When you find the Spin Inversion points dropping, do you run a Spin
    Inversion program just once and assume the electron spin is corrected?
    Can you tell if it is corrected - should some drops be corrected? 

    2 If no drops clear, should one apply the Spin Inversion program again
    until at least one drop clears?

    3 If all points drop sharply, should I give a 2-7 energy treatment (with
    Ozaliet, Selenium, Berberis) before beginning the session? I assume some of
    the drops should go away.

    4 Also, I believe I have learned that when I treat someone with the hand
    rods and then I check the meridian that I cleared before the hand rod
    treatment but find the drops are back, that is called a Hidden Spin
    Inversion. Is this correct?
   
    5 Anything additional you can say about Electron Spin Inversion and Aura
    Weakness would be appreciated.

    Answers

    1 You can never assume anything. You must always check. Even if just one of
    the 6 Spin-Inversion points is corrected, the electron spin is corrected.
    The other dropping points then have nothing to do with the Spin Inversion. 
   
    2 You should indeed run the Spin-Inversion program once more if all 6
    points continue to drop sharply. However, the Spin-Inversion points are of
    course normal points, they could also drop for other reasons. You need to
    observe HOW the points drop. If they all drop sharply, then there is likely
    something wrong energetically. If, after running the Spin Inversion
    program, the points still drop but drop more slowly, there are different
    reasons and you should just find remedies using the measurement protocol
   
    3 No, this is not the right approach. First you test if Ozaliet matches, if
    it does you leave it in the slot and continue your measurement. If Berberis
    and Selenium are needed this will show up on your Hormone System. 
    So if there is an aura problem, Ozaliet will be measured and becomes part
    of the Standard Hand treatment along with everything else you find. There
    is no need for an extra treatment.

    4 I hope you made a typing mistake because of course you need to check ALL
    meridians in the second measurement and not just one. 
    A Spin-Inversion is hidden if it does not show itself by the fast dropping
    6 points. But this shows only AFTER the treatment. If, after the treatment,
    ALL the same points still show drops, you must treat with the Spin
    Inversion program followed with the Standard Hand program containing all
    the remedies you found earlier.

    5 Lifestyle is of major importance to address when there is Aura Weakness.
    Usually it is caused by adrenal insufficiency and this, in turn is caused
    by using energy the wrong way. If you don’t address this issue at the core
    nothing will change. Ozaliet is merely a supportive remedy.

Chronic Constipation

judyth
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Symptoms Flag
53 year old female with chronic constipation of many years.  

I first saw her last summer. 
Measurements:
Stomach - many drops
Small Intestines - many drops
Large Intestines - many drops
Remedies used:
All Appendicitis remedies, both Tonsillitis remedies, both Ulcers, Penicillin,
Staph, Strep etc 

I saw her many times and gradually all drops cleared. 
When she finished seeing me, she had stopped taking all supplements except for
some digestive enzymes and herbs for her constipation.  She was unwilling to
give these up, had been using the herbs for almost 20 yrs.  

I haven't seen her for several months.  She came to see me again because she
would like to stop the herbal supplement for constipation.  She hadn't taken it
for several days, 

Measurement:
No drops. All points had good sound, no screaming like endorphin high.  
Attempt to unmask endorphin high:
I put in Plumbum, Viscum, Atropinum still no drops. 

Then I treated her with: 
The Standard Program >12:
Carcinoma Coli (I had never used this before with her), 
Plumbum (this I had used before to clear drop on Pancreas), 
Aluminum ( I had used this before to clear drop on NS).  
Footplates:
Bacteria Proteus
Bacteria Coli
Bacteria Pyo
Bacteria Lactis   

After 4 days she came again today, still no drops and now she hasn't had a
bowel movement in about 6 days. 

She never had any drops on her Liver or Kidneys and only once on the
Gallbladder which cleared with Calculi Bil and Calculi Renales, 

Reneel, Aluminium and Plumbum are the only heavy metals I've used to clear
drops. 

She'd like to return to her supplement but has agreed to wait a bit longer.
Where do I go from here? 

Thanks.  Judyth

    Hi Judyth, 
    she did not have any drops today? and when you put in the Carc. Coli,
    Plumbum and Aluminium, did the measurements change or show drops?  Did you
    never discover any drops at all during the session with her? When you
    remeasured after the footplate treatment with the 4 intenst. flora - there
    where still no drops? If so I would definitily treat for Spin Inversion to
    check what changes afterwards.

    In this case, I would check if she has a Spin Inversion, because this too
    can cause Endorphin High. You can check this by treating it with the Spin
    Inversion treatment with blood and see what comes up after that.
    Then I would look for a Whiplash too.

    If there is still no signs of drops I would put in Schwefheel and Psorinum
    in the slots and measure her again to see if that brings up a new layer /
    new drops to be balanced.

    From what you have done,
    I would say that most get bowel movement as a reaction to treatment with
    Carc. Coli, Plumbum and Intest.Flora too, so the question is why is it
    still there?

    Spin Inversion, whiplash seems to me to be the place to start searching,
    and not to give up. the remedies you have used might be useful again, but
    check for Spin Inversion and then Whiplash first. then go with the drops
    that hopefully appears when you remeasure.

    How much does she drink of water pr day? Dehydration is also causing
    constipation.

    Let me know where there are drops or not next time and how the Spin
    Inversion match or not, so we can give more clear advice on where to go for
    you and your client

    Good luck'

    Hello Judyth

    I've restructured your post to make it more readable for everybody and
    especially Johan so he might be willing to look at it too. He's a very busy
    man..... So I hope you don't mind.

    I think Spin Inversion and Whiplash are good possibilities to try and
    uncover the imbalances that are not showing, since the other anti-endorphin
    protocol didn't have any effect. There should be drops, since there's no
    way that she can be healthy with a bowel that hasn't emptied for days. That
    alone is a huge burden on the body since toxins are not expelled...  

    Treating the Gallbladder with all possible Gallbladder remedies at the same
    time might also be a suggestion to lift the suppression. Liver and
    Gallbladder are always involved in long standing constipation. Healthy bile
    flow is needed for regular bowel movements and bile flow gets sluggish from
    constipation and the toxins that are not expelled and build up in the
    body.... it is a viscious cycle. 

    The thing with long term use of laxative herbs is that they can actually
    damage the bowel and it takes time for the body to repair that. Carcinoma
    Coli and Mucosa might be good remedies to use for this, but you're already
    using that. 

    Longstanding constipation can also lead to the formation of diverticula
    because of the pressure on the Colon wall and a lack of muscular strength
    (Liver) So maybe Diverticulosis might help too. The toxin from the Botulism
    bacteria is known to cause constipation, and this remedy is maybe something
    to try too.

    And of course Plumbum....

    herself out of Spin Inversion daily. Next appointment one week.

    When she comes next week, I will measure and treat drops. Can I continue to
    treat with Carcinoma Coli, Plumbum, Aluminum until bowels are more normal
    in volume or will this create dependency?  We were both suprised to find a
    Spin Inversion. 
    She has never had Hidden Spin Inversion. Is having to take herself out of
    Spin Inversion daily - do you think the stress of this is causing the Spin?
     Her water consumption is generally good - 2 litres a day- when she is in
    Spin she gets disorganized.  

    Thank you both  for your help.  I hope my form is easier to read, let me
    know if I can make it easier. judyth

    I'm sorry, but you are on the wrong track. You should never use recipes,
    especially if they don't work. What is important is to try and find out
    what is wrong! Repeating the same treatment all the time is something you
    should never do.

    There are several things I'd like to point out and ask:

    a. Why do you (and she) think she has to get herself out of Spin Inversion
    every day? Do you measure her regularly? How do you know she has it?

    b. Schwefheel and Psorinum don't unmask endorphins or anything, they are
    remedies that are used for therapy resistance (the physical body doesn't
    react on the treatment, while the energetic body does)

    c. Endorphins are always caused by stress and this is a Gallbladder
    problem! You should always start treating the Gallbladder in case of
    endorphins even if it doesn't show. So start to treat with Gallbladder
    remedies and Intestinal Bacteria.

    d. If you measure Chronic Appendicitis (or Necroticans) on the Small
    Intestines it must also be in the Large Intestines. But Acute Appendicitis
    is limited to the Large Intestines, so it is strange that you measure it on
    the Small Intestines.

    e. If she has exhausted Adrenals like you've measured, this gives stress.
    The Sodium/Potassium balance is likely to be out of whack and this can
    cause fluids to be extracted from the large intestines, which causes
    constipation. Is she puffy? This can also be a reason for the wrong
    measurements, fluid retention in the tissues gives false (high) readings.
    Focus on the Adrenals is necessary in this case and you have to find out
    what causes the exhaustion. Something in the environment like EMF,
    something emotional, toxins, infections....?

    d. Another thing I've noticed is that you mainly find drops on the hand.
    Feet are often moist and that can give false good readings too. It is
    strange that you only find drops on the hand, especially since the
    Gallbladder most likely has an imbalance.

    Hi Johan,

    I wonder why you start treating with intestinal bacteria
    (bact.lactis,pyo,coli,proteus), when there is endorphine high situation. 

    I understand why you use gallbladder remedies for example; Atropine in this
    situation.

  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    February 2013 edited March 2013 Flag
    Since the measurements are not reliable in this case, you have to go by
    symptoms. 

    Treat the Gallbladder to get the endorphins down (when the Endorphin
    Protocol with Viscum, Plumbum Atropinum doesn't work), Atropinum for the
    Gallbladder is not enough, use all Gallbladder remedies especially Billiary
    Cirrhosis.
   
    The Intestinal Bacteria are used for the symptom of constipation.
   
    If you want to know more about Endorphin High, please read all my comments
    on this in other posts. There is a lot of misunderstanding about it.

"Hidden Spin Inversion, the way I understood it, is when a client has symptoms
but there are no drops (as if they are healthy), run the spin inversion
program."

    Hi Renate, 

    Hidden Spin-Inversion is actually a situation where the measurements
    initially don't show that there might be a spin-inversion. So you find some
    drops and some good points just as usual, then you find the remedies that
    seem to correct them, just as usual. But then after you've done the initial
    hand treatment NOTHING is corrected and all the same points drop. This is
    Hidden Spin Inversion and for this you have to run the Spin Inversion
    program with blood in the cup. After that you can use the same remedies
    you've measured before and then they do correct the points.

    What you describe is an Endorphin Mask. Everything sounds wonderful. Good
    clear sounds and no drops, but the client comes to you with symptoms and
    you know that nobody is 100% healthy to begin with. So in this case you
    have to bring the endorphins down by using Plumbum and Viscum and maybe
    also Atropinum.

    Karolina:  Now I understand much better.  I had the mistaken belief that it
    is endorphins only if all the sounds are HIGH pitched.  And that there is a
    form of spin if they have the normal pitch with no drops.   Your detailed
    explanation is much appreciated.

    Do I understand correctly that if I place Viscum, Atropinum or Plumbum in
    the slots, and remeasure with the results being no change in the sounds,
    that it's not endorphins, but spin?

    I don't have to run Viscum, etc., just put them in the slots and remeasure
    for the sound. If there's a change then I would run those, but if no change
    than try spin?

    That's how I've been doing it and it seems to work, but just checking.

    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    Viscum, Atropinum  and Plumbum are used to lift suppression ("endorphin
    mask"), but when there's no change when you measure with these remedies it
    does not necessarily mean that there are no endorphins. It just means that
    you were not able to lift the suppression just by putting these remedies
    in…
    Gallbladder remedies might be tried next, but it might also be necessary to
    actually run a short program with the remedies. 

    Whether the cause of the suppression is Spin Inversion or any other
    underlying stress factor, the direct cause for the points not dropping is
    elevated endorphin production.
    The underlying cause will show when the body is more relaxed and the mask
    is lifted. When Spin Inversion indeed was the cause of the suppression the
    measurement will show this in the usual way when the endorphin suppression
    is gone. So the six points will start to drop now.

    When you are not able to lift the mask, you can try to run the Spin
    Inversion program and see if this works. Even when there's no actual Spin
    Inversion, the treatment is very relaxing and might lift the mask...

    Preferably you wouldn't want to lose the information of there actually
    being a Spin Inversion, since this has all kinds of implications for your
    overall approach to the session => when you know there's Spin Inversion you
    want to find out what environmental cause is there.

    So, is it true that Spin Inversion is an endorphin phenomenon ? Or is
    endorphin and Spin two different  phenomenon? 
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    May 2014 Flag
    These are two different phenomenon.

    * Spin Inversion is always caused by an electromagnetic field that
    interferes with our own electromagnetic functioning.
    A strong electromagnetic field can cause the spin of our electrons to slow
    down and eventually to turn the other way around. The weaker our system is,
    the easier we get into Spin Inversion.
    Spin Inversion is indicated by all 6 points dropping sharply as indicated
    in you Measurement Protocol.

    * Endorphins are our body's way of coping with an extreme cause of stress.
    This stress can be anything (e.g. too much exercise, overworking, fasting,
    certain drugs, severe pain, toxins)
    Overproduction of endorphins is indicated by measuring no drops where drops
    are to be expected (e.g. someone has liver cancer, but the Liver meridian
    shows no drops). With a complete Endorphin Mask, all points seem to be
    fine.

    * The confusion you have surrounding this subject is probably caused by the
    fact that Spin Inversion is very stressful to the body and sometimes does
    cause an Endorphin Mask, but this happens not that often. Usually you will
    measure Spin Inversion the way it is indicated in the protocol.

    When you do measure an Endorphin Mask, the first thing to do is to bring it
    down by measuring with Plumbum, Viscum, Atropinum in the slots (or if this
    does not work to treat with these in a short 2-7 program). Then a more
    "honest" reading will appear, and if the underlying cause was Spin
    Inversion, many points will start to drop steeply.

January 2016 - Professionalization of Biontology Worldwide

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
January 22 edited January 22 in Q&A Flag
Introduction

First of all, in response to something that was emailed to me about an inverted
listing of the Biontology Remedy Book, I want to emphasize once more that
Biontology is not about focusing on remedies according to symptom. The whole
picture of symptoms of a remedy needs to be taken into account and can be
helpful, because it shows you why a remedy might match. But randomly choosing
one symptom from the complete list of a remedy in the Biontology Remedy Book is
just not the way it works.
I have observed that many people have a tendency toward this misguided way of
working, and that is why the choice was deliberately made to NOT include a
remedy list according symptoms in this book.
The fact that now someone, without my or Karolina’s consent, has turned the
Remedy Book around to make it into some sort of recipe book per symptom, is not
only copy right infringement, but also not helpful to improve one’s Biontology
skills. Anyone who is giving into the temptation of searching for remedies not
by the full picture, but by symptom, will only divert further away from
mastering Biontology. Once again, you need to focus on the meridians and
sequence of treatment.

Apart from this complete lack of understanding on how to work with the remedies
correctly, I think it is very disrespectful to Karolina, that after the
enormous effort she has put into creating this remedy book for you, someone has
copied it and is selling this copy. There was no permission to use any of the
contents of the book. We were not consulted. It is plain copyright infringement
and anyone who supports it is part of the reason why I do not want to continue
in the US anymore. I am done with the rogue culture and all the
self-justification that goes along with it.

Of course most of you are not like that at all, but that doesn’t make any
difference if you don’t make an effort to truly confront people who wrong
others. I understand that no one dares to make a stand on his or her own,
because we have experienced the aggression and smear campaigns this unleashes
ourselves. But there is an antidote, and that would be a positive and visible
Biontology movement that holds a high ethical standard. This is not what is
happening right now. From what has reached me, the only conclusion I can make
is that the get-togethers and individual contacts of therapists, when it comes
to talking about the subject of the Biontology community, are mostly used to
spread or continue rumors and to self-promote. A practitioners’ platform can
only be created by you, and should not be mainly focused on indiscriminate
mutual affirmation but on mutual growth. The misconception is that light is all
about good feelings. Light is about exposing Truth, not about continuing
illusions because it is easier and feels good.

Let’s for example look at something you may consider a quite innocent and maybe
even generous thing to do. I have noticed that the minute we send a message to
our members or post it on the forum, it is immediately forwarded to
non-members. If you look at the bigger picture, HOW can you consider this the
right thing to do? It is an illusion that forwarding forum posts and Health
Angel information to practitioners who do not pay membership fees is helpful to
anyone BUT that person. The membership fee is a necessary cost to maintain the
technical part of the website and keep someone in office for your support. And
to be honest, with the number of members we have, it does not even cover those
costs completely. Supporting people who do not pay by giving them information
causes all motivation to become a member to disappear. Ultimately this will
lead to less support for everyone and, while you help someone get information
they don’t pay for, all people who DO pay for it will suffer the consequences.

You always have to have that helicopter view, and then you will know what
consequences your actions may have. That is what Biontology is all about. And I
hope at some point you will come to an understanding on how to build that
positive community and support system that is so much needed. Practitioners in
the past have been looking at me to do this, but that is impossible. I had
hoped that the people who worked for me could make a healthy start, but I hired
the wrong people and they did the opposite by affirming the negative and
putting blame outside instead of creating a fundament of ethical conduct.

That brings me to the first question, which is:


Question

What do you hope will happen as to the further development and
professionalization of Biontology worldwide, but especially in the Netherlands.
What would be the ideal situation from your perspective? A central point of
contact regarding all Biontology matters for example?


Answer

We hope that you continue or start to view Biontology as serious and complete
as other healing modalities. When practitioners of other specialized modalities
organize themselves they do so to share their experience with just THAT
modality and to deepen their insights and skills in using THOSE tools that
pertain to THAT specific modality. They do not divert to subjects that have
nothing to do with their profession. For example, a professional meeting of
acupuncturists will not include Reiki or any other completely different
approach. Whatever is not part of the modality should be kept out of it or only
considered for their influence in general, but not as something to include in
your own practice.

Less is more. And that does not only account for Biontology, but for every
modality that was developed as a stand-alone therapy. Really understanding a
subject means focusing on that subject. The best therapists of any modality are
the ones that only do that one thing and fully dedicate themselves to the
subject. But even if you do this, you can continue to learn a lifetime.
Spreading your attention thin over many subjects will make for superficial
knowledge of many things, but will never make you master anything. My hope for
the future is that many of you may master Biontology over time. For most of you
this means letting go of many previously held assumptions and not losing sight
of the basic framework of Biontology treatment as laid down in the manual.

So any organized platform for Biontology should maintain its focus as pure on
Biontology ONLY as possible, and this way it can help the associated
practitioners to stay on track and deepen their understanding of the tools that
have been given to them and to work these tools to their best effect.
The Biontology community as you call it, is still far from professional. What I
have heard and sometimes witnessed myself, is that whenever there is a meeting,
or practitioners communicate with each other it is always more about other
things than about Biontology.

The previous forum that was set up as a practitioners’ sharing platform, is a
clear example of everything that can go wrong. In the end most of the advice
given there was not even about Biontology anymore. It didn’t matter what the
question was, measurements were never asked for and the answer had hardly
anything to do with Chiren treatment.
Some examples of communication on that forum: Your client is tired? Use some
diluted salt in the morning. Your client has asthma? Advise a liver flush, here
is the recipe!
This is not helpful at all, and when questions are going to be answered in this
way, you would rather not have a Biontology platform at all. When a question
cannot be answered from a foundation of understanding Biontology, then the only
solution is to get a BETTER understanding, not to search in different
directions.

If Health Angel Academy is going to recognize a Biontology platform, it should
be led by CERTIFIED Biontologists, and ensure guidance for less experienced
practitioners. Also it should project a clear and recognizable professional
picture to the public, so clients know what to expect from Biontology. There
should be a central point of contact for clients who want to get assistance
after maltreatment, because this still is a serious concern, and they should be
able to get proper treatment to correct whatever irresponsible practitioners
may have done. Until now Karolina and I have provided this kind of assistance
for free, but that has become impossible now, and it should also be a shared
responsibility. If you want for Biontology to be taken seriously in the public
eye, you need to create a professional organization that shows responsible
conduct of all members. It is very important that both practitioners and
clients continue to be aware of the dangers of unprofessional application of
biophoton therapy and at the same time it is just as important to remember what
Biontology IS capable of. Practitioners who fail to achieve what other
practitioners DO achieve with their clients should search for improvement of
their own skills instead of blaming their clients, the therapy or something
else.

The main aim should be continued awareness around responsibilities towards
clients. We have received too many complaints from clients of practitioners who
were behaving themselves very unprofessionally both in the way they practiced
Biontology and in a general way. To illustrate I will read part of the latest
complaint that reached us, and that was just two weeks ago.

“ …First of all, I would like to inquire about your selection of pupils. What
are the selection criteria and how easy is it to get an official license to
treat as a Chiren practitioner? What is the process? What are the requirements?
How are these people screened for this? Can anyone be accepted to be a Chiren
practitioner, in other words, can just anyone play with this machine?

My next field of concern is the series of treatments. Does the practitioner
have the responsibility of committing to the duration of the treatment? Does
the practitioner have the right to stop all treatment after a couple of
treatments, in the middle of agreed upon treatment plan, at his/her own will
and power? If we have understood correctly, Biontology is something you can't
try just once out of curiosity, you have to commit to it, it's a process,
correct?

My greatest concern and the most important question is that what happens to the
body after the healing process has started and the practitioner has ended the
treatment and cancelled the appointments? My mother has reacted very strongly
to the treatment from the start, and her symptoms as very severe at this
moment.

I'm hoping for a reply and some guidance in order to know how to proceed in
this situation.”

This is part of her follow up letter in which she explains things in more
detail:

“Neither myself nor my mother know the true reason for ending the treatments
because it was handled in a very strange way. We can only guess that the woman
has some sort of issues or mental health problems or she got nervous when my
mother started asking detailed questions about the whole process of Biontology.

She was only treated twice. Three days after the second session my mother
received some very disturbing email messages written in the middle of the
night.
The woman wrote that my mother is an old shaman and the practitioner herself
was an old witch who was called to destroy the old shaman energy, therefore she
could no longer threat my mother "with the light". Pretty special, don't you
think?

My mothers symptoms right after the treatments were very strong feeling of
dizziness, excruciating headaches, strong and stabbing pain in her abdomen,
vomiting and diarrhea, sore throat, leg cramps, muscle cramps and spasms in her
rib cage area.

My mom discussed these reactions with the woman and the woman replied that this
is what Biontology is about and this is normal reaction and this is the reason
why Biontology isn't written much about.

At this point, all we can hope is that these treatments haven't caused any
permanent damage to my mom. Is there anything we can do to ease these symptoms?
”

So for those who haven’t picked up on all that was done unprofessionally I will
sum it up.

A. The first treatments that were given were not according to protocol and had
extreme consequences for the client.

B. After it was clear what the consequences were, instead of inviting the
client back and assisting the body to recover from this wrong treatment for
free, she did the opposite and told her client to stay away. And then, of
course, she needed to justify this, which she did by creating some
quasi-spiritual delusional plot about not “treating shamans with the LIGHT”.
One should leave one’s religious believes out of it. Biontology is for
EVERYONE. No one is excluded.

C. She convinced her client that this kind of a response is normal within a
Biontology treatment plan, and it is definitely not. It may happen that you
over-treated by accident, but it is not a normal or desired reaction and should
be a sign that you should reflect on the way you have treated. I do not mean
for anyone to feel guilty. Recognizing one’s own mistakes and taking
responsibility for them are necessary aspects of mastering anything.

D. This practitioner claims, as many unrightfully do, that she is certified and
has been mentored by me personally. This gives the wrong impression and affects
ALL of you who are really making an effort to work ethically and
professionally. So I would suggest that if you organize yourself, you also
address this kind of conduct. It is important that you can speak out.

My biggest concern is that clearly the misbehavior often is accompanied by
extreme arrogance en delusions of own importance. I agree with the letter
writer that there seems to be an issue with several practitioners experiencing
mental instability. I don’t know how many, but there are at least 10 known
practitioners who are hurting their clients under the flag of Biontology. It
will take a solid professional organization to show the world a positive and
stable face of the Biontology community, so that these people don’t become the
co-creators of your professional image. It will surely affect perceptions in a
very unwanted way. The only way to prevent a negative image from emerging is to
become very visible in a positive way. And that is what we hope will happen for
Biontology in the future.

Behind in Answering Questions.... Please Help

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
March 2013 edited January 2014 in About This Forum Flag
Hi all,

Johan and I have to do so many things, that we easily get a little behind in
answering all of your questions. 
If you have something that is now at the bottom of the list that really needs
answering, submit an empty comment (or if the forum doesn't accept, just one
word) underneath it so the discussion becomes actual again. This way we can see
what needs our attention.....

We do our best to help you all to get some good answers. But we also need your
assistance in keeping things manageable on the forum.

Sometimes it might help to study cases and answers of old posts or to read the
new measurement protocol. I can see in some of the questions that a lot of
answers that are already given are not completely read or integrated in your
sessions yet... 

Another way to help us is to look at the posts that already are restructured
(most case presentations on the forum) so you can try to create yours it in a
similar way. This will safe a lot of time. 
Right now I still have to redo most posts before Johan even wants to look at
them. Without the restructuring it takes too much time for him to get the
core-information out by reading.... 

Pointers to make a post easily readable:

DON'T 

Don't use abbreviations!  

Don't use capitals for words that don't matter..... 

Don't use too many words, rather write "Measurement: Adrenals,
Para-Thyroid,...." than writing "I started measuring and found out that the
first point TW was dropping and also the parathyroid and....." 

Don't give just one symptom or medical diagnosis and ask... can I help this. Be
more specific, we don't treat by symptom (we need the whole picture) and a
medical diagnosis doesn't tell you anything you need for the Biontology
approach. Biontology is holism and we treat the individual. There's not one
person exactly the same...

Don't copy-paste a text in the regular text box, but use the symbol in the
menubar above it with the notepad and letter T. This way the lay-out, that is
often not recognised by the Vanilla forum, is not copied at the same time.  


DO 

Do use capitals for the remedies, meridians and maybe symptoms (again no
abbreviations for any of them)

Do use space in between different subjects

Do use italic and bold formatting to give more structure to your post (examples
in previous posts)

Do give symptoms, background, measurements, treatments.... 

Do put the remedy you measured next to the point/organ system that it corrected
drops on



Please think of, and with us to make everything clearly understandable. Thank
you!

Selecting Remedies

Satya OrionSatya Orion
October 2015 edited October 2015 in General Questions Flag
Client:
I have been treating myself for many months and all meridians were clear with
no dropping points for several weeks.

This week's session

Symptoms:
Lung congestion
Tinnitus

Measurement:
Liver (L) - 2 middle points => Streptomycenium, Klebsiella Pneumonie, Q Fever.
 
No other points were dropping


>12 yrs Treatment:
Streptomycenium, Klebsiella Pneumonie, Q Fever

Results:
Lung congestion cleared in the days following treatment.  
Tinnitus greatly diminished (which I noticed was a symptom of Streptomycinum).

Question:
1.  Was it necessary to treat with all 3 remedies, if any one of them cleared
both dropping points?  
2.  If only one of these nosodes cleared both points, is it possible that the
other 2 remedies might be needed in a later treatment, or possibly not at all?

Thank you for clearing this up for me.   I encounter this issue frequently
where more than one remedy will clear the same points, particularly where
toxins are involved.  I want to be sure that I am not over treating.

    have been measured on three different points, because there were only two
    drops, and normally you would use the first remedy that matches. If any of
    these remedies cleared both points, there is no need to search for and/or
    treat with other remedies. 

    2. IF there are still drops after using one of the remedies, then you might
    find the other remedies in a subsequent session, but this is definitely not
    a rule. Usually when a remedy works, it works. Focus should be on
    correcting biophoton coherence (no drops), and the remedies are just an aid
    in this. If 3 remedies can individually achieve this, you only need to pick
    one of these.

I submitted quite a few questions for the Q&A, which I sent to Robert Schuurman
at Health Angel - but none of these questions were answered.
Is there somewhere else I should be sending these questions?  

Also, there was a lot of background noise of other people talking during the Q&
A broadcast, which made it nearly impossible to understand what Johan was
saying for at least half of the time.

    The best way to submit questions is here on the forum in the section Q&A.
    Usually Robert forwards me the questions that were sent to him right away
    when he receives them and then I collect them in one document. I looked
    through my mail and noticed that I overlooked your e-mail... I am so sorry,
    and will put your questions and answers in the Q&A section if you like. 
    It is especially a shame since there were not that many questions this
    time...

    The background noise is very unfortunate. Participants should all mute
    their microphones themselves. I don't know why this didn't happen this
    time.

    Anyway, I will post all of the questions and answers on the forum again as
    usual so you can look back at the questions that you did not fully hear.

Ebola

I have a client who is a flight attendant and is concerned about the spread of
ebola.  
Can we get an ebola nosode?

    I think for anyone creating homeopathic remedies it is almost impossible to
    get hold of a good mother tincture of ebola. It is considered extremely
    dangerous and every infection is isolated immediately….

    Another problem is that nosodes that are created the right way (through
    dilution and potentizing) are hardly available anymore because of stricter
    regulations for homeopathy worldwide. Even many of the old nosodes are not
    available anymore, so it is unlikely new ones like ebola will be produced. 
   
    There may be remedies created with frequency generators but they are
    useless.

    Personally I think our best shot to get valuable "ebola information" is if
    we can get hold of the vaccination and make a remedy through
    neutralisation. This vaccination of course contains more then the ebola
    information alone, but that does not matter. So if one of our MD's is
    willing to arrange something like this that would be great.

    Why is it that remedies created with frequency generators are useless? I
    know they are often used in kinesiology through many nutritional systems-is
    it that they are only good for testing but not treatment? -The Morphogenic
    Field Technique company has produced frequencies of cellular energies and
    so I wonder what the usefulness of the generator generated energies might
    be? Any insights would be appreciated.

    I find it amazing that the country went ballistic with the Ebola virus
    "fear" ... What about the 485,000 people who die ANNUALLY in this country
    from the abuse of pharmaceutical drugs and "mistakes" with drugs in
    hospitals? I don't see anyone getting all fearful about taking all the
    drugs they are given! Go online and do some research. The 3rd leading cause
    of death is just from these things! ONE person died here, who got sick in
    another country, and 4 people have left hospitals already who had Ebola.
    So, doesn't that tell you something?

    I'm not saying it is wrong to try to get something, but it is not deadly in
    this country as it is in the African countries where people live in very
    close quarters and don't have the medical assistance they need. When I
    first heard the news, I said to my partner, "How long do you think it will
    take before they have a vaccine for this?" It took ONE WEEK.... (Karolina:

    Mini Session - 11/02/15 (2 days after previous session)
   
    Recent Development
    Last night my client felt she was having a stroke.  She could barely talk
    and the left side of her face was paralyzed.  She was taken to the
    hospital. A CT Scan and MRI revealed a brain tumor on the right side.  No
    further results.

    The hospital would not give her a room unless she agreed to radiation
    treatment, which she did not want, so she returned home.

    Current Condition
    Very tired
    Left side of face somewhat drooping
    Some difficulty talking
    Difficulty concentrating

    Treatments
    Whiplash and Spin Inversion  (via Chikey at her home)
   
    Comments
    She told me that she has had Tinnitus for many years on the right side and
    wondered if there was a connection.

    I will focus on the Gallbladder during our next full session on 11/5, and
    test for possible causes of the brain tumor.
   
    Question
    1. Yesterday she had just begun taking the Spore Probiotics, despite my
    suggestion this was not needed, and I'm wondering if this could have been
    too much for the body.

    I think her initial reaction to refuse radiation was right. Radiation
    therapy will seriously affect her brain and hormonal glands, which will
    result in more symptoms thereby reducing the quality of her life even more
    than is now the case...

    The symptoms look a lot like Bell's palsy. Causes being Gallbladder and
    Stomach. Too many probiotics can lead to extensive infections, especially
    if the body is out of balance. But I do not think that this has contributed
    to her present condition.

    I would definitely check her Cerebral Arteries if it is a stroke. If it is
    then the Cerebral Arteries should drop and react on Barijodeel or
    Aurumheel. 
    Otherwise it might be a tumor that is pressing on the Arteries or Veins in
    the brain.

    Recent Developments
    Client met with her oncologist 11/6

    Brain tumor => 1" in size, with a lot of swelling in the surrounding area.
    Recommended treatment => "Gamma Knife Radiosurgery" 
    Given prognosis => 2 months to live without suggested treatment, or even
    more invasive surgery
     
    Current condition:
    Still some paralysis on left side of face => affecting speech somewhat
    Left hand dexterity => also affected

    Comments:
    I am especially aware that the focused radiation treatment for the brain
    tumor may cause the lung tumors to grow.  

    The only good news is that she is no longer able to drive her Prius.

    Gamma Knife Radiotherapy is a very strong, one time, gamma radiation
    treatment of the brain tumor, which has slow acting affects to decrease the
    tumor over several months time. I want to treat with remedies to help the
    rest of the body deal with the radiation. 

    Questions
    2.  Will treating with causticum or Radium Bromatum decrease the
    effectiveness of the medical treatment ?

    3. Would it be alright to give her a Chiren treatment immediately following
    the radiation, as soon as she returns home (usually the same or next day)?

    I will be giving her a session today and will post results

    I seriously do not recommend the radiation treatment. It is never as
    focused as the doctors want you to believe. Radiologists and Oncologists
    have told me this and that radiation always affects the Hormonal glands and
    the blood which brings the radiation everywhere, thus creating widespread
    symptoms.

    Answers
    1. I do not believe that the probiotics caused these problems.

    2. I would treat with Lymphomyosot and other drainage remedies as well as
    the Radiation remedies. The focus should be on the drainage of the Vessels
    in the brain. Check if there is Calcification or Cramping in the Vessels,
    or otherwise improve the movement of the Valves in the Veins with Hamamelis
    or Mellilotus.

    3. You can treat immediately after the radiation but apart from temporarily
    having an energetic effect, it does not seem to have a permanent physical
    effect. Radiation seems to have a tumour increasing effect.

    Again, the focus needs to be what caused the tumour and not on the tumour
    itself. The fact that the tumour is increasing fast it indicates that the
    cause is still there.

    thank you so much for your comments!

    She does not want to have the radiation treatment either, but the prognosis
    of only 2 months to live has scared her badly, and she doesn't know what
    else to do. I will share what you have said, and have said similar things
    to her myself. I felt completely horrified when I read the description
    about the treatment.
    Do you feel her body could heal itself, with the help of the Chiren,  in
    this short amount of time (if this is in fact an accurate prognosis)?

    2. There is calcification and I have been treating with Aurumheel and
    Barijodeel for 3 sessions now.
    The Gallbladder (R) was dropping this session for the first time. The only
    remedy that matched was Cholecystitis. I treated with Lymphomyosot.   Which
    other drainage remedies do you recommend?
    For radiation remedies, Radium Bromatum, Causticum - are there others you
    would recommend?

    3. I was concerned about the tumor increasing quality of the radiation as
    well. It seems like such a bad idea. I am actively treating calcification
    and also now the Gallbladder. Today's session - session 9 - is posted under
    Lung Cancer - few drops.

    Any and all advice is sincerely appreciated.

    Radiation 
    If the prognosis is only two months, it will also be the case with
    radiation treatment. As you have said the radiation treatment works slow,
    too slow. Her best option is to remove the cause of the tumour. Radiation
    is better than chemo, but doing nothing seems to have the longest survival
    rate of these three options.

    Spin Inversion
    The cause might very well have been the Spin Inversion, but the cause of
    this must be investigated AND removed if the Spin Inversion keeps showing
    up.

    Calcification
    There is the calcification factor. if this is the cause of the blockage in
    the vessels then Barijodeel and Aurumheel are the right remedies, but do
    not forget to use Placenta for the tiny vessels that play an enormous role
    in the brain. If there is calcification I would also expect Calculi
    Biliaris and Renales. These stones are also a result of calcification. 

    Gallbladder
    The Gallbladder issues are worse than just Cholecystitis. I would
    definitely use more than this.

    Original Cause
    The processes have been going on since way before 1984 and have never been
    dealt with. Therefore the tumours came back, they are probably far more
    widespread than is thought at the moment.

    Additional Therapies
    Spiritual healing is most of the time an illusion that does nothing as far
    as health is concerned, and sometimes it may even make matters worse. This
    woman does do many things apart from Biontology that are all disturbing the
    healing processes that Biontology could provide. The stress that is caused
    by all these things is enough to make everything worse.

    Recommendation
    My recommendation is to let this client go and wish her well with her
    endeavours. 


    Answers to questions
    * There are no other drainage remedies than, Lymphomyosot. If it is
    calcification that needs to be removed the remedies for this are Aurumheel,
    Barijodeel, and Aesculus.

    * The only radiation remedies are Causticum and Radium Bromatum.

    Johan, I appreciate the wisdom in all you have said.

    Question
    If she were to suspend all other treatments following the radiation, could
    the Chiren help at all, or would this also be useless? Originally you were
    suggesting there would be a different treatment plan possiblle following
    the radiation treatment.
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    November 2015 edited November 2015 Flag
    Answer
    The Chiren could possibly help in relieving side effects of the radiation,
    thereby possibly nullifying the effects of the treatment. If the radiation
    does not have any effect, you do not know if the radiation is not
    effective, the tumour not responsive or if the Chiren treatments are
    interfering with the radiation

    My experience has told me that when people undergo radiation treatment, all
    the points react to Causticum, meaning that virtually the whole body is
    affected. It also means that Causticum is the dominant remedy and you
    cannot measure much more. This will be the case all the time as long as she
    has radiation treatments.

    Also, other things she does besides radiation are a problem. The car she
    drives, the steroids she takes...
  • 
    Satya OrionSatya Orion
    November 2015 edited November 2015 Flag
    Questions
    1. Would this possibility of nullification also be the case without using
    the radiation remedies?

    2. Could it help her to continue treating only the Kidneys?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    November 2015 Flag
    Answers
    1. Treatments with the Chiren always have an effect. So they could still
    nullify the radiation, even without the radiation remedies. But I do not
    know. Causticum does not affect the radiation but deals with the effects on
    the tissues. The Radium remedy is rather new and I do not know its full
    effects.
    If you treat without remedies, I have no idea as to how far the effects
    will be.
    If one takes steroids, the result will be delayed anyway. Every 3
    treatments have the effect of one treatment, if one takes steroid
    medication.

    2. You can do Kidney supports only provided the Kidneys are OK to start
    with. The Kidneys do not take radiation out of the body. They get
    themselves also radiated because the blood (and everything else in it) is
    radiated and the Kidneys clean the blood. By getting burdened with radiated
    material themselves, the Kidney tissues get immediately affected.

    I recommend still to leave the patient until she is done with the road she
    has chosen. I never recommend to walk two roads at once. You are battling
    uphill and it does not work.

found no match. Also tested for possible radiation damage (Radium Bromatum,
Causticum, Galium, Montmorillonite), but no match.

No other dropping points

Comments

I was quite startled that the Large Intestine was asking for the Flora remedies
on the first session, and even more surprised when the meridian was completely
clear on her second visit.

Also knowing of her spiritual healing experiences and feeling this case may be
an expression of the miraculous.

I didn't give her a treatment the second session, as I wasn't sure what to
treat, with none but the organ degeneration meridian dropping.  

She has decided not to have further diagnostic xrays, but possibly an
ultrasound test instead.  She is wondering if there is another non-invasive
test possibility.


Questions

1.  Afterwards I wondered if I should have done further testing on the Organ
Degeneration meridian, particularly relating to the Liver, since this was the
origin of the Lung Cancer.  What is the best way to work with this meridian?

2.  Still wondering about the possibility of endorphins.  Should I have treated
with the endorphin remedies?

3.  Client would like to do a follow up session.  I'm wondering how long to
wait, and suggestions for treatment.

    Answers:

    1. The Organ Degeneration meridian almost always drops the first session(s)
    so there is not much use for it so early on. Usually drops disappear after
    the first couple of treatments according to protocol (this also happened in
    this case, there was no need for a cancer nosode)
   
    If there is suspicion of actual cancer, you can try to measure cancer
    nosodes on this meridian, but then these nosodes should also match on the
    meridian connected to the organ where the cancer is physically manifested. 
    So measuring Carcinoma Bronchi on both the Organ Degeneration meridian and
    the Lung meridian gives an indication that manifested cancer is a 
    possibility. 

    2. This is without a doubt a case of endorphins. Your client feels
    "wonderful" and has "good energy", but the reality is that she has cancer!
    So her body is lying... I have seen this picture before in cases of cancer,
    and it is important to recognize it for what it is or you will miss the
    opportunity to address the real, underlying situation.
   
    3. She needs to be treated weekly, and you may have to navigate by symptoms
    that she had before she was feeling great. Endorphins will not always
    resolve by treating with Viscum, Atropinum, or Plumbum. You can also try to
    measure with Gallbladder nosodes, but if nothing works you need to look at
    the (past) symptoms.
   
    The fact that her tonsils, appendix, and a part of the colon were removed
    would lead me to chose the 3 stages of Appendicitis and 2 stages of
    Tonsillitis + Intestinal Flora in a first attempt. Possibly hitting a
    causal pattern by making an educated guess will relax the body and unmask
    the endorphins... You will have to try and thoroughly observe the
    response...
   
    Don't try too much by giving too many treatments in one session. You always
    need to be careful with people who are really sick, and when illness leads
    to many endorphins the body is already under a lot of stress... treat and
    support wisely. 
   
    Good luck!

    Thank you very much for these suggestions and sharing your experience.

    I did measure Carcinoma Bronchi on the Organ Degeneration and also on the
    Lung meridian and it did not match.  I also tried Carc. Hepatitis
    Metastisis, on both meridians which did match in the first session, but not
    on the second.

    I'm feeling  confused now by the apparent balancing of the Large Intestine
    with the Intestinal Flora.
    These were the only remedies that matched, and the meridian was no longer
    dropping on the second session.

    Are you saying that the kidneys could perhaps still be needing these
    remedies even though they are not showing drops?


    Unfortunately, this is all complicated by the fact that I may be moving out
    of the area in a month, and feeling this would not be enough time to do
    much work with her,  given the difficulty of this situation.  Is there any
    way I could work with her in this short a period of time that would be
    beneficial?

    She was aware of this possibility when she came to see me, but wanted to
    come anyway.

    Carcinoma Hepatis Metastasis was measured on the Organ Degeneration
    meridian, but did not match anywhere else... so it does not tell you much.

    And because of the lack of drops and likely endorphins you really cannot
    trust your measurement for a proper assessment. 

    You did not find any drop on the Large Intestine(R), but with a removed
    Appendix there should be some form of Appendicitis measurable. 

    When everything is masked you should be extra careful with the Kidneys.

    Pre-Measurement:
    I measured with Atopinum, Chelidonium, Plumbum, Viscum, Zincum Valericum,
    Belladonna
    to correct for suspected Endorphins.

    All points were dropping

    Spin Inversion treatment - with saliva (3 times with no effect)   with
    blood (2 times)
    Whiplash treatment

    1st Measurement:
    Lungs (L+R) - all points => Tuberculinum  (measured Carcinoma Hepatis
    Metastasis (R) but did not treat)
    Large Intestine (R) = all points => Tuberculinum
    Nervous System (R) - all points => Insecticides
    Organ Degeneration (R) - all points => Carcinoma Hepatis Metastasis
    (measured but not treated)
    Kidneys (L+R) - 4 distal => Bact. Coli, Bact. Proteus, Cystopyelonephritis
    Bladder (L+R) - all points => Bact. Coli, Bact. Proteus
    Gallbladder (L+R) - all points => Adenmyose Gallenblase (not treated)

    >12 yrs. Program
    Bact. Proteus, Bact. Coli, Bact. Lactis, Bact Pyo. Cystopyelonephritis,
    Tuberculinum, Insecticides
   
    Footplate Treatment
    Chelidonium, Aesculus, Berberis, Selenium, Solidago, Nux Vomica, Viscum


    Comments
    No dropping points following each treatment.
   
    I made the decision to treat with Insecticides (measured on Nervous System)
    as I had already measured and treated this on the Thyroid several weeks
    ago.  This client lives in the same pesticide toxic neighborhood as I do. I
    have also had to clear myself every several weeks.

    I tested all Appendicitis remedies on Large Intestine, with no match.


    Question
    More drops were evident this time following Spin Inversion & Whiplash
    treatment, plus measuring with additional endorphin remedies.  I'm
    wondering if I also should have treated with these remedies (using a 2-7
    Program), particularly as there were no drops on the Circulation meridians,
    which seems unusual.

    Finding Intestinal Flora Bacteria infections on the Kidneys in combination
    with all drops on the right hand Large Intestine meridian does indicate
    Appendicitis Necroticans... It is strange this did not match. Even the
    history indicates Appendicitis... 

    Lungs (yin organ) should not have focus in this stage.

    Nervous System should not have any focus in this stage, and considering the
    condition of the Kidneys, stimulating detoxification of toxins
    (Insecticides) is a very unwise decision!

    Answer
    The remedies you measured with are not the usual "endorphin remedies"  
    (only Plumbum, Viscum, Atropinum) and I do not see why you used them all at
    once... In my experience all those remedies are not necessary. You should
    try if any one of the remedies would have the same effect. If that is the
    case, you can leave that remedy in the slot and treat with it
    simultaneously with the rest.

    It might be strange not to have any drops on the Circulation but it really
    does not matter. With all the drops you have no room for Circulation
    remedies anyway. So I would leave it for the moment.
    With all the drops on Kidney and Bladder, I would have selected for all
    Kidney and Bladder support remedies in the Footplate treatment.

    Thank you very much for this feedback. I just had a session with her last
    night, but will implement your suggestions for her next treatment.

    4th Session - 10/4/2015
   
    Pre-measurement
    I measured with Plumbum, Visum, Atropinum to correct for suspected
    endorphins

    Treated for Spin Inversion (which was measured).

    First Measurement
    Large Intestine (L+R) - all points =>  Appendicitis (L)  Polyps Larynges
    (R)
    Circulation/Arteries (L+R) - all points =>  Aurumheel, Barijodeel (did not
    treat)
    Insulin Point (L) =>  Selenium
    Lungs (R) - all points => Carcinoma Hepatis,  Aspergillis Niger (did not
    treat with these remedies)
    Thyroid  => Strumeel
    Thymus (R) => Little Flannel Flower
    Diabetic Point => Biliary Cirrhosis
    Kidneys (L+R) - 5 distal points => Cystopyelonephritis (L),  Bact. Coli (R)
     Bact. Proteus (R)
    Bladder (L+R) - 5 distal points => Bact. Coli, Bact Proteus
    Gallbladder (L+R) - 5 distal points => Biliary Cirrhosis

    >12 Yrs. Program
    Appendicitis, Polyps Larynges, Bact. Coli, Bact. Proteus, Bact. Pyo, Bact.
    Lactis.  Cystopyelonephritis,
    Biliary Cirrhosis

    Footplates Treatment
    Nux Vomica, Selenium, Solidago, Strumeel, Little Flannel Flower, Berberis,
    Aesculus

    Final Measurement
    Circulation/Arteries (L+R) and Lungs (R)  => All points still dropping
    following treatment.
    All other points cleared.

    Comments
    In looking back, I realize I should have used more Kidney supports on the
    first treatment as well, and that probably the measurement of Intestinal
    Flora on the Large Intestine (L) was incorrect - and was really needed by
    the Kidneys (which weren't showing in the first session).

    My choice to treat with Insecticides was because I had already used it in
    the first treatment to clear the Thyroid, but I see now that using it then
    and using it now was not a good decision for the Kidneys.

    Yes, I agree that the Lungs should not be treated at this point -  I was
    treating the Large Intestine with Tuberculinum (which I found also matched
    on the Lungs - but not my reason for using this remedy)

    I asked her about the black mold and she told me there was lots of black
    mold on the outside of her home.

    Thank you for following in detail the format for posting cases on the
    forum. This is very readable and saves me lots of time... thank you, thank
    you, thank you!!!

    Comments
    Finding Insecticides twice can mean two things. Either the body was
    overloaded, was not able to act on your treatment, and thus did not excrete
    the toxins, or there is a continuing source of exposure, which then is very
    important to find so it can be eliminated from your client's life...
    Remember that if a cause is not removed there is very little the Chiren can
    do.

    Before you try Strumeel on the Thyroid point, make sure you have tried all
    possible nosodes first. Nosodes are always preferred over support remedies.
    When you find Strumeel on the Thyroid, this indicates either a problem in
    the iodine metabolism or an iodine deficiency. The first may be corrected
    by this remedy, the second needs supplementation, preferably through iodine
    rich food (e.g. seaweed) or otherwise you may try a drop of nascent iodine.

    Thank you for your feedback Karolina.

    Unfortunately the Insecticides are a continuing environmental problem in
    this area.  Living in the same town, I have also had the same issue.  There
    is heavy pesticide use on lawns and gardens weekly, as well as nearby
    non-organic farms.  My personal solution is to move to another healthier
    location.  I will talk with her about this.  Also measuring Aspergillis
    Niger on her lungs, it seems especially unhealthy for her here.

    Thank you for your advice about the Thyroid.  This seems especially
    important for her, with a history of
    uterine fibroid tumors, and Large Intestine polyps.

    4th Session -  10/9/2015
   
    Current Situation
    She reports feeling quite a lot of congestion in her left lung,  a feeling
    of fluid, but not coughing.
    She has an appointment with her oncologist next week for a diagnostic xray.

    Pretreatment
    I measured with Plumbum, Viscum, Atropinum for suspected endorphins.

    Treated for Spin Inversion (which was measured) twice.
    an added note - she unfortunately drives a Prius

    First Measurement
    Small Intestine (L+R) - all points =>  Appendicitis, Botulism
    Circulation/Veins (L+R) - all points =>  Aurumheel, Barijodeel (not
    treated)
    Nervous System (L) - all points => Botulism
    Large Intestine (L+R) - all points => Appendicitis, Botulism
    Lungs (L+R) - all points 
    Lymphatic System (L+R) - all points => Botulism
    Thyroid => Chronic Tonsillitis
    Diabetic point => Biliary Cirrhosis
    Bladder (L+R) - all points => Bact. Coli, Bact. Proteus
    Kidney (L+R) - 5 distal => Bact. Coli, Bact. Proteus
    Gallbladder (L+R) - 5 distal => Biliary Cirrhosis

    >12 Yrs. Program
    Appendicitis, Botulism, Bact. Coli, Bact. Proteus, Bact. Lactis, Bact.
    Pyo., Chronic Tonsillitis, Biliary Cirrhosis
   
    Footplates Treatment
    Berberis, Neuralgarheum, Albumoheel, Populus, Solidago, Reneel, Nux Vomica,
    Aesculus

    Final Measurement
    Circulation/Arteries (L+R) - all points => all other points cleared

    Questions
    1. What would cause the Lungs to suddenly have no dropping points following
    this treatment?  This seems unusual, as she has been diagnosed with Lung
    Cancer.

    2. Knowing that she will be having a diagnostic xray the day before her
    next session,  which supports would be good to add because of that
    radiation exposure?

    Final Measurement
    No points dropping

    Comments
    At the end ot the session she told me that she was diagnosed with Cervical
    Cancer at age 28 (the reason for the total hysterectomy).  She had not
    previously told me about this cancer diagnosis.

    Questions
    1.  What would be a likely cause for cervical cancer?
    2.  Would this still be measureable on the proximal Bladder point?

    Comment
    If she is really getting into Spin Inversion again during treatment, then
    there must be something environmental or inside her body that is causing
    this. It can be metal in the body or metal in her chair for example. But
    you need to remove the cause then.

    Answers:
    1. The cause of cervical cancer is not known to me. But I have found many
    misdiagnoses based on the pap smear. I found that this pap smear is very
    unreliable if it is not investigated immediately.
    It can come out as Level 4 while in reality it was Level 1.

    2. This cancer should be measurable on the most proximal point of the
    Bladder meridian, but I would also check other Bladder points. I would test
    the various forms of cancer to see what type of cancer it would be. 
    Carcinoma Uteri => caused by the Thyroid
    Carcinoma Hepatis or Coli => caused by Toxins
    Ovarian Cyst => caused by Circulation

    But usually cervical cancer is a misdiagnosis, and I would always advise
    ask for a second opinion from a laboratory that can test the smear 
    immediately after collecting it.

    I suspect that the environmental cause for the recurring Spin Inversion is
    my office unfortunately. I feel this is the case, as this situation happens
    with almost all of my clients.  

    I have made what changes I can in my office, but the problem is with the
    wiring of the house.  We have made all changes possible, but it still
    persists. The electrician feels it is "dirty electricity" entering the
    lines from outside. I will be moving very soon and expect this will remedy
    the situation which is also affecting my health.

    And . . . all of this said, she does drive a Prius, which she is unwilling
    to give up.

    I am making a correlation between Carcinoma Uteri matching on the Proximal
    Bladder point and her diagnosis of Endometriosis/Fibroid Tumors which were
    present before the Hysterectomy

    I wasn't sure if I should be treating with Aluminum with so many Kidney
    points still dropping, but it was the only remedy I could find to balance
    the Bladder (R)

    The treatments seem to have little effect. The same points continue to
    drop. You need to first take care of the cause of her Spin Inversions,
    otherwise treating is wasted time. If she wants to continue to drive this
    Prius it is her choice, but I would be very clear about the effects this
    will have on her health. And you should warn her that treatment will not
    have much of an effect if she goes back into Spin Inversion the moment she
    drives home.

    If the electricity in your office feels "dirty", I would have the
    electrician test if the electricity is grounded. If it is not grounded you
    get a huge electrical field in the room. This is extremely dangerous, both
    for you and for your clients. Leukemia can easily develop.

    I normally don't measure this many points on the Kidneys. They are too
    close together.

    You should not have treated with Aluminum while the Kidneys were in such a
    bad condition. 

    When you do focus on an organ system you also need to support it. Since you
    did choose to treat the Bladder, I am missing the Bladder support...

    After Spin Inversion, the Kidneys should have the highest priority in your
    treatment.
    You need to really focus on the Kidneys, and also on the possible organs
    that may cause the infections on the Kidneys. So also look at the Bladder
    and Intestines. The Circulation can wait for now.

    Comments
    Johan, thank you for this advice. I saw your comments after I had already
    completed this treatment, so did still treat the Circulation.

    I was surprised to see the Kidneys were balanced.  I retested several times
    to make sure there was not a measurement error.  Looking back at the
    previous session, it seems that Staphylococcus may be what cleared both the
    Kidneys and Bladder.  

    Regarding my office, it is in my mother's home and I've already had the
    house checked by an electrician.  It is properly grounded.  Unfortunately
    there is a slight amount of current coming in on the neutral wire, which
    the electrician suspects is bleeding into our system from another house in
    the neighborhood.  He disconnected everything else and there was still a
    slight current on the neutral wire.  

    I had a piece of PVC spliced into the water line where it enters the house
    to correct current that was also found there.  I've spent many dollars and
    hours trying to correct these problems.  I tried Stetzer filters and found
    they created more problems then they fixed.  

    Ideally I would have an office, but can't afford it.  I'm planning to move
    soon.

    Questions
    1. I was thinking that Berberis and Solidago were also supports for the
    Bladder.  Should I have used a more specific support?
   
    2. Which are the points that you recommend measuring on the Kidneys?
   
    3. The Tonsillitis that was affecting the Thyroid was also cleared.  Could
    the Staph infection also have been the cause of the Tonsillitis?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    October 2015 edited October 2015 Flag
    Like you, I find it surprising that the Kidneys have suddenly cleared. I am
    also wondering why the Large Intestine on the right hand does not indicate
    anything. Bact Coli normally does not match the left Large Intestine
    meridian. 

    Answers
    1. The remedies that you mention are no support that are specifically
    focussed on the Bladder. 
    You need to also use: Cantharis, Plantago, Sabal preferably.

    2. I measure all the points that I can find. 

    3. It could have been. Finding Staph and Strep on Bladder and Kidneys,
    however, is not a very likely find.

    Note: I wrote that the Circulation could wait, because the Kidneys should
    have the highest priority. If there really is no problem with the Kidneys
    anymore, that would be a different story. But since the measurements are
    suspicious you should take the safe road.

    Thank you.  I will see what the measurements on the Kidneys are in the next

    Is it also correct that no treatment should be given for the Lungs until
    all the yang organ systems are completely clear?

    I am curious as to why you say - "Bact Coli normally does not match the
    left Large Intestine meridian."  It is indicated for the Large Intestines,
    - do you mean it's a rare possibility or that it would be on the Right
    Large Intestine?  or most likely on the Kidney and Bladder?

    Stefano:
    It would normally show up on the right Large Intestine meridian, which
    would indicate it is needed to rebuild the Intestinal Flora.

    If it shows up on Kidney and/or Bladder, which is also common, this
    indicates an infection with these bacteria.

  • 
    Satya OrionSatya Orion
    October 2015 edited October 2015 Flag
    I was mostly just curious to see what was measuring there.  I realize that
    I would not treat with all these nosodes.  My understanding now is that I
    would treat with the fewest nosodes that corrected these drops, since the
    focus is on correcting drops.

    Question
    So reflecting on your comment, there is no point to test any further than
    the nosodes that correct the dropping points.  Is this correct thinking?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    October 2015 Flag
    Answer
    Yes, that is correct. Once a nosode corrects a point, then you leave it.
    You do not test further on that point, unless after the treatment the point
    drops again. Choosing remedy, you should always choose a nosode that is
    likely to fit on many points. 

    If I put in a nosode for the Lympahtics and it matches I always test
    immediately if points are corrected on Stomach, Small Intestine, Large
    Intestine. If it is a Staph or strep I might test it on Lungs and Heart.
    That is why I always test the whole body, to see where points drop, so that
    I have an overview on how I could get a maximum result with a minimum of
    nosodes.

    Final Measurement
    Lungs (R) - all points dropping
    All other points clear

    Comments
    As the Kidneys were clear at the beginning of the session, I continued
    treating the Circulation.

    I checked Appendicitis and Chronic Appendicitis and Diverticulose on the
    Large Intestine first, but no match.

    She opened up a lot more to me during the session about her habits of
    perfectionism, impatience, looking good, overachieving - and also deep
    feelings of inadequacy.  She said she realized this stressful lifestyle
    probably had led to the cancer. 

    We talked about the black mold which is by her front door.  She is going to
    look into having it powerwashed (on a day when she is not at home, with all
    doors and windows closed)

    Questions
    1.  Last session the Large Intestine was also asking for the Intestinal
    Flora.  Is it normal that it would be showing up again this time?  Does
    this mean there still might be some other disturbance on this meridian?

    2.  She requested the Impatiens and Larch remedies..  We read about them
    together and they seemed appropriate.  Is it helpful to use flower essences
    at this point, or could it cause masking?

    3.  She has been taking a Supergreen Probiotic formula, and also just
     began taking a Spore Biotic formula.   My feeling is that these are not
    needed.  Will they interfere with her treatments, especially as the Large
    Intestine has asked for Intestinal Flora of its own now?

    4.  Her reason for the probiotics is symptoms of gas and bloating.  The
    Gallbladder has not shown itself yet, but I'm thinking to give it support
    anyway with Chelidonium.  Would this be appropriate?

    Comments on 8th Session
    You mentioned that you checked Appendicitis and Chronic Appendicitis, but
    did you check Appendicitis Necroticans? 

    Answers
    1. All points on both Large Intestine meridians drop, so it is highly
    unlikely that the Intestinal Flora is already needed. Usually this means a
    stage of Appendicitis or a specific infection. When the Large Intestine is
    ready to restore the Intestinal Flora, not that many points drop anymore. 
   
    However, when the Large Intestine IS ready, it could ask for the Intestinal
    Flora two times but no more. 
    If you continue to measure Intestinal Flora, then it means that there is
    still an issue in the intestines that prevents the introduction of Flora
    into the body. This may be caused by:
    a) The Intestinal climate that is not right yet, or 
    b) A lack of physical healthy Flora that reaches the Intestines

    2. How exactly did you assess the need for these Bach flowers? Did the
    emotional problems come up naturally, or did you initiate the conversation?
    If they came up naturally/spontaneously this is often a release in itself. 
   
    Also the areas that Larch and Impatience would have a masking effect on,
    are normally already addressed if you measure and treat according to
    protocol. If you put them in last when the organ systems of your focus have
    already been corrected, there is no reason to worry. 
    Since flower essences are very weak and temporary in their effect, the
    masking will only pose a problem if you used them before addressing the
    drops with the proper nosodes. The masking will not last until the next
    session.
   
    However, the emotional problems she has should have pointed you in the
    direction of the Gallbladder, which also matches some of her physical
    symptoms. Once the Gallbladder system is balanced, her emotional problems
    will improve too.

    3. If she has been taking these supplements and the body still is asking
    for Intestinal Flora, there is your answer... It does not work, and may
    even have contributed to the problem itself.

    4. Gas and bloating are Gallbladder conditions. Chelidonum is not
    sufficient, there must be other issues measurable on the Gallbladder that
    need to be treated with nosodes.

    Reply to Comments on 8th Session
    Yes, I did also check for Appendicitis Necroticans and it did not match.

    Questions
    1.  Yes, I was surprised by this as well.  During my most recent session,
    which I will post after I finish this reply, the Large Intestine has no
    dropping points.  Also, Intestinal Flora are no longer measuring on any
    other meridians.

    2.  No, I did not initiate the discussion about the Bach Flower Essences.
     My client asked if I had these two remedies.  It was quite beautiful how
    it worked out, as she has never opened up to me before, always had on an
    "everything's fine" face.  I knew this wasn't true, but she had seemed
    unwilling to share more. But in this session she shared very deeply with
    me, following reading together about these two flower essences.

    So, while I sensed these issues were present, I didn't know for sure, and
    the Gallbladder meridian had no dropping points.  Yes, I did put them in
    last after all the other meridians were balanced.  Thank you for giving me
    more clarity on this subject.

    3.  Yes, I was thinking this as well, which is what I told her.  She has
    finally accepted this advice.

    4.  I just learned about the gas and bloating a few days ago - another
    example of her not sharing fully what is going on with her.  Now that I
    recognize this about her, I questioned her in more depth about her
    symptoms.  During our session  today, there were drops on the Gallbladder
    meridian and Cholecystitis matched.  I will post this session now.

    If your client is going through with the radiation therapy, you will need a
    different approach of treatment. From that point on, you can post the
    sessions underneath THIS discussion.

    However, as long as the radiation hasn't started yet, you can continue
    following protocol and post the sessions here. This will make for easier
    reference to these different situations, that demand different ways of
    treatment. 

    Note: When there has been so much suppression, and considering the severity
    of her condition, it is much more likely that Billiary Cirrhosis (chronic)
    is necessary than Cholecystitis (acute).

    9th Session - 11/07/15
   
    Current Condition
    Very tired, agitated
    Some paralysis of left arm and hand
    Drooping around mouth on left side.

    Medical Treatments
    Many diagnostic X-rays => past few days
    Meeting radiology team (10 November) => to prepare for upcoming radiation
    therapy

    Medications
    Steroids => for brain swelling and inflammation
    Other medications => she could not remember

    Pre Measurement
    Measured with Plumbum, Viscum, Atropinum

    Treated for measured Spin Inversion

    First Measurement
    Circulation (L+R) -  all points =>  Barijodeel, Aurumheel, Uric Acid (did
    not treat with this remedy)
    Lymphatic (R) - all points  => Cystopyelonephritis 
    Lungs (R) - all points => Staphylocuccus (not treated)
    Kidneys (L+R) - many points => Cystopyelonephritis
    Bladder (L+R)  - many points => Cystopyelonephritis
    Gallbladder (R) - many points => Cholecystitis
    Liver (R) - Nail point => Radium Bromatum (did not treat)

    >12 Yrs. Program
    Barijodeel, Arumheel, Cystopyelonephritis, Cholecystitis, Berberis,
    Chelidonium, Causticum (because of X-ray exposure), Belladona, 

    Footplate Treatment
    Populus, Solidago, Reneel, Aesculus, Lymphomyosot, Thalmus, Viscum,
    Colchicum

    Final Measurement
    Lungs (R) -  all points dropping.   No other dropping points.

    Testing Cancer (Brain Tumor) Cause
    Circulation (proximal) + Organ Degeneration => Ovarial Cyst (Carcinoma
    Hepatis did not match)

    Other Measurements:
    Kidneys, Gallbladder, Liver => Radium Bromatum => not used in treatment
    (too much for the Kidneys?)

    Circulation => Uric Acid => not used in treatment (too much for the
    Kidneys?)

    Treatment Result:
    End of session => felt completely relaxed

    Questions
    A.  I wasn't sure if I should treat only the Kidneys in this session, but
    Circulation and Gallbladder are such strong causal factors in the brain
    tumor, that I decided to continue to treat them as well.  Was this a
    correct decision?

    B. I did not treat with Radium Bromatum or Uric Acid as to not overburden
    the Kidneys, was I correct in this thinking?
   
    C. This is a very challenging case for me, and I sincerely welcome all
    feedback.  Thank you!

    I personally would have done this (in this case), just to be sure. If an
    assessment is unlikely (does not add up with the symptoms and history) I
    would go for the safe route. You cannot go wrong with adding Billiary
    Cirrhosis when you already focus on the Gallbladder. The nosode will only
    have an effect if there is resonance, which means it is needed by the
    Gallbladder. 

    What you need to keep in mind also, is that steroids will greatly diminish
    the effectiveness of biophoton treatment. I know it is hard, but please
    educate your client that because of the current medical route she is
    taking, and about to take, the expectations for Biontology helping her body
    to self-heal should be lowered. When radiation therapy and/or chemo are
    being done, Biontology can merely be instrumental in reducing side-effects
    and helping the body cope... Self-healing may be initiated again after the
    radiation courses have been finished. 
    Honesty and setting realistic expectations are important... Only this way
    she can make an informed choice.

    Johan's comments on, and answers to your session will follow later.

    thank you Karolina.  I appreciate your words very much.  I have just
    written to my client to share this information, and what Johan has said as
    well.  I feel much better to have been completely honest with her in this
    way so that she can make a completely informed decision.

    I know that she has been badly scared by the two month prognosis they have
    given her, which does not help her think clearly.

    The radiation treatment she is considering is one time only.  They will not
    take another diagnostic xray until 3 months from the time of the treatment.

    I will  have a session with my client in 2 days (11/12).  She is having
    another CT scan today, but has not yet had the Gamma Knife treatment
    (possibly next week). 
   
    Questions 
    1. I will treat with Lymphomyosot.  What other drainage remedies do your
    recommend for the vessels of the brain?    

    2. Which radiation remedies should I use now?   I am using Causticum.
     Should I also use Radium Bromatum? Anything else?
   
    3. Still wondering if it is safe to treat with Uric Acid (which was
    measured on the last session)

    Answers
    1. What possibly needs to be removed from the vessels of the brain are
    calcium deposits, and for this the remedies are Aurumheel, Barijodeel and
    Aesculus

    2. Causticum is the best remedy at the moment for the X-rays. I do not know
    if the Radium is the right remedy for the upcoming therapy. You will have
    to see what matches.

    3. You should simply treat with the Kidney remedies.
  •

    Answers to Questions 9th Session (November 7)
    A. Kidneys ALWAYS have to be treated. Because Kidneys and Bladder are
    dropping the likely cause is Intestinal Flora bacteria. The Kidneys must
    come right before doing much else.
    To treat the other factors was in this case not the right decision. The
    likely cause in the vessels in the head is likely to be a calcification
    issue and thus to treat with Gallbladder remedies is not effective and also
    premature.
    But the Kidneys have absolute priority and to treat these, you will need
    all your slots.

    B. There is no use to treat with Radium as long as she has not had the
    radiation treatment as yet. And I wonder if this is of any use at all. It
    is not the right radio-active element as far as radiation sessions, but
    perhaps it can be used since the effects might be similar

    C. You should not treat with other detox remedies than the Intestinal Flora
    and ALL the Kidney and Bladder support remedies. ​​It is not unusual for
    Uric acid to match on the Circulation meridian if the Kidneys are not
    functioning. The main focus should be on the kidneys, because this is the
    cause.

    Questions
    1. The Intestinal Flora Bacteria did not match on the Kidneys.  Could this
    have been due to suppression? I'm wondering if I can trust any of my
    measurements fully in this case.

    2. To clarify, I'll  treat with:  4 intestinal bacteria, Berberis,
    Neruralgo Rheum, Albumoheel, Solidago, Populus, Reneel, Plantago,
    Cantharis, Sabal.. 
    Am I understanding correctly that these are the only remedies to use, or
    could Aesculus, Lymphomyosot and Causticum (for the CT scan she had today)
     also be added?

    3. When will it be time to resume treatment with Barijodeel and Arumheel
    for calcification?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    November 2015 edited November 2015 Flag
    Answers
    1. Although the Flora Bacteria do not match, the Kidney and Bladder
    meridians still drop. Suppression is likely. Toxins like Formaldehyde may
    also be a cause, but you need to be very careful with this and use all
    Kidney and Bladder support.

    2. As far as the CT scan is concerned, she will likely have a
    Spin-Inversion at the least because of being around high voltage hospital
    equipment. The X-ray effect you can treat with Causticum. Lymphomyosot and
    Aesculus are also ok to use.

    Why do you want to use Neuralgo-Rheum? I suppose you want to put it in for
    the pain. I always look where the pain is located and then match a meridian
    that runs over the painful area.

    3. You can resume with the calcification remedies once Kidneys and Bladder
    are clean. But you should wait with Biontology treatment until the medical
    treatment is over.

    November 2015 edited November 2015 Flag
    The Gallbladder meridian seems to run over the area of the tumor,  but your
    previous advice leaves me feeling it would not be wise to treat this.
   
    I will have one last session with her this Thursday before the medical
    treatment next week.  Then we will wait several months until after she has
    had the final xray and the medical treatments are over.
   
    Question
    Neuralgo Rheum is listed as a Kidney support in the Chiren manual.  This
    was my only reason for using it. Would it be better to leave it out of the
    treatment?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    November 2015 edited November 2015 Flag
    Answer
    Neuralgo Rheum can be used as "Kidney support" when there are uric acid
    related complaints like joint pain, arthritis, and rheumatic complaints.
    This way it is used for Kidney conditions, but if there are no matching
    indications, this is not a typical Kidney support.

    10th Session - 11/12/15
   
    Current Situation
    This will be my final session with this client while she undergoes medical
    radiation treatment for the brain tumor.  She said she would like to resume
    Chiren treatments in 3 months after her follow up CT scan.

    She has had a combination of 5 MRI and  CT Scans in the past few weeks (
    most recently 11/10)

    Physical Condition
    Very tired
    Agitation => due to prescribed steroids (taken twice daily)
    Insomnia

    Pre-measurement
    Plumbum, Viscum, Atropinum

    Treated for measured Spin Inversion (twice)

    First Measurement
    All points dropping -  Causticum measured on all points
    Kidneys (L+R) -  Bact. Coli, Bact. Proteus

    I didn't test for any further remedies, as I knew my primary focus was the
    Kidneys and this was our last session.

    >12 Yrs. Program
    Bact. Coli, Bact. Proteus, Bact. Pyo, Bact. Lactis.  Berberis, Aesculus,
    Lymphomyosot, Causticum

    Footplates Treatment
    Populus, Solidago, Reneel, Albumoheel, Placenta, Plantago, Cantharis, Sabal

    Final Measurement
    Circulation/Veins (L+R) - all points dropping
    Lungs (R) - all points dropping
    Lymphatics (R) - all points dropping

    Comments
    I learned that this client is actually in her 70's.  I think she has spent
    her whole life pretending.
    She talked about how hard it is for her to say how she's really feeling,
    even now in her depleted state, possibly dying.  She told me, through
    tears, that she can't hold things together anymore.

    I saw how the stress of this lifestyle is probably what has caused her
    cancer.

    I wondered if she had asked about what her quality of life might be after
    the radiation, about side effects.
    She said she didn't want to know.  Again, this same pattern.  My feeling is
    that she will not survive long.

    I feel sad about how this situation turned out but recognize that Chiren
    treatments cannot help her without possibly negating the medical treatment
    she has chosen to undergo. I'd hoped she might change her mind about the
    radiation treatment, but she said she felt there was no other choice for
    her.

    Yes, I learned so much from this case on so many different levels - in
    particular, the devastating effect of suppression on the body, through
    lifestyle and medical treatments.  

    I see this happening all around me.  I feel discouraged that many of my
    clients value the opinions of their doctor above all else.   I am observing
    first hand the very limited perspective of these medical evaluations,
    particularly in the case of cancer. 

    I have found only one client so far (besides myself) who was willing to put
    total focus on Biontology treatments.   I'm wondering if other
    practitioners have this same experience.

Measurement Problems..... Not Endorphin Masks

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Measurement Flag
What I notice is that many students are too much focussed on Endorphin Masks
and this causes you to overlook other measurement problems.
Problems with your technique like pressing to hard, problems with fluid
retention, problems with sweaty hands and feet, using to much water on your
probe.... they all cause high sounds and none or few drops.

An Endorphin Mask doesn't create high sounds, but normal sounds without any
drop. Abnormal high sounds in measurement only occur in very rare cases of
acute infections, so not in most of our clients who have chronic conditions.
There is so much suppression nowadays that I haven't found a true inflammatory
high reading in anybody since 1990.

High readings everywhere is a problem with water/sweat. Too much water on your
probe, water retention in your client, sweaty hands and feet. This is solved by
drying the hands and feet with a towel or, in case of water retention,
improving the circulation.

To put the Endorphin Mask (not the high sounds!) in perspective, I would say it
only happens in 1% of the treatments and it doesn't show high readings. The
very high sounds as an indication for infection, you can keep in the back of
your head for those very, very rare occasions when you do encounter an acute
and severe infection. In those cases it is more likely for people to run to the
doctor or hospital then to us anyway... You can bring those high readings down
by using Belladonna.

    Good Johan,
    what I have seen and heard in class, is that the word  "High" create
    misunderstandings since measurements deal with tunes that high or low, drop
    or no drop. This is great for them who thought Endophins High meant high
    sounds, to repeat this explenation and instead attend to other approaches
    to high readings like measurement problems.  

    We are all learning more when it comes directly from you in written on how
    you think Chiren is best used, and  the sharing you offer lately is
    remarkable. 

    The growth of Biontology benefits from it
    A good investment from your side, to allow more people to copy your
    achivements by sharing your knowledge and perspective in the process of
    making Chiren treatments as effective as possible.  

    Thanks

    Want to know more about this.... I have 3 clients with Fibromyalgia.

    1. Sometimes I measure normal sounds without drops. And then think about
    endorphines, as these women have to deal with crises of pains, and bad
    nights. Their body is really tired.

    2. Sometimes I measure very high sounds. You write there's the possible
    water-retention or inflammations
    (I have to measure very softly (they're in pain) I hope this is not the
    problem).

    Those ladies gained much wheigt and have much inflammations and oedema's
    for example on hands and feet (this makes measuring very difficult
    sometimes). 

    Does these 2 scenarios make sense?


    I understand I can measure Inflammation checking with Belladonna? 

    About the water-retention: how can I improve the Circulation, when I have
    no drops?

    These questions are not meant about the Fybro, but about finding no drops,
    with high or normal sound.

  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    February 2013 edited January 2014 Flag
    if you want to know whether there are infections, you try Belladonna. If
    the measurements do not become lower, then you are not dealing with acute
    infections. Only acute infections will give high readings, but it is very
    rare to find an acute infection. Especially since we deal mainly with
    chronically ill people with malfunctioning immune systems.

    Fluid retention can be caused by any or all of the following:

    a) Exhausted Adrenals. 
    b) Problems with the Heart (Bacteria) 
    c) Problems with the valves in the Veins
    d) Problems with the Kidneys
    e) Cramping in the Blood Vessels, Capillary Vessels or Lymphatic vessels
    f) Calcification of the vessels

    All these problems normally also lead to very bad tissues where the body
    will dump all kinds of toxins that it normally gets rid of, but now cannot
    because the sewage is blocked.

    The bodies of your clients with Fibromyalgia suffer from a lot of stress
    and because of the fluid you cannot measure properly.
    Because you can hardly press, the probe might not get anywhere near the
    point so your measurement does not reflect the condition of the related
    organ but reflects the condition of the local skin and tissue.
    Because you cannot measure many points it becomes difficult to ask the body
    what it wants.

    So you need to go on symptoms only.  In order to find out what the cause
    might be it becomes necessary to ask questions from the client (in stead of
    asking their body). Time lines are very important here. So when did it
    start, with what symptoms did it start. what happened then etc.
    From this you should be able to assess as to what the problem was in the
    beginning and treat accordingly

    Thank You very much, Johan!

    I understand:

    high sounds could be acute infection, then check with Belladonna; as the
    sounds are lower, then there is acute infection.

    I started to realize how big the problem with water-retention could be for
    proper measuring only some weeks ago! Found big problems on Circulation and
    Adrenals. First because of the fibromyalgia I focused on Gallbladder/Liver,
    couldn't really get through... but I will bring 'this' further in a new
    discussion.

    Much appreciation for clearing these questions! Inge

Plant Fungus - Remedy?

katherine
May 2013 edited May 2013 in Animals Flag
My husband, has just begun a position overseeing a large Biodynamic garden.
There is a big bed of Garlic with the beginnings of rust Fungus. 

Question:
Could we put some of the Fungus in the Cup and a glass of water on the
Footplate with blue light and press Neutralization? And then spray the water as
a Remedy to try and stop the Fungus?  
There is lots to do to work more with the soil but is there a way to do
something now with a Remedy and how do we make it?

    It is possible to do it like that, but you'll have to use the water
    immediately since it doesn't hold the information for very long.

    I would also put in Calcoheel (not during the neutralization program)
    You can also treat the soil. The way this can be done depends how big the
    beds are.

    It surprises me that the Fungus appears in the first place, since a
    Biodynamic Garden is supposed to be healthy and not show Fungus or anything
    else.

    3. Then start the short program (2-7).

    If there is no electricity in the garden, you might use the battery pack or

    Water with Salt works better than water with Alcohol.

    If the water is replaced then you need to treat the water again. If there

    Water with Alcohol: has the problem that it evaporates -even in a closed

Support Remedy Details

Renate
September 2013 edited January 28 in Study Tools Flag
Hi Karolina,

Thank you for reopening the forum to questions.  I understand that you have
much on your plate and that responses may be slow. Your dedication to providing
accurate information during this time of growth in the biontology community is
much appreciated!

Several of the support remedies are listed in various forms in the Heel Manual.
If a remedy is not labeled in the existing Chiren Manual as a composite or
homaccord does that mean it is simply an individual remedy?

For the supports that contain only one individual remedy:  Do you have a list
with the exact name of those remedies? For instance Berberis is not mentioned
as a composite or homaccord in the Chiren manual which would indicate it is an
individual remedy. (Assuming it is labeled correctly). However, the Heel manual
states the Berberis individual remedy can be in the form of Aquifolum or
Vulgaris each having slightly different indications.

Do you have a list of the exact names of the individual remedies in the Chiren?
If that is made available on the forum, which is currently functioning as a
manual, we could then use the Heel manual to more precisely select remedies
while you are working on the daunting task of revising the manual.

    this. I will release an accurate, organized list of Compositae and
    Homaccords with ingredients and potencies and an easier to grasp
    description than the Heel manual, since this is so full of medical and old
    homeopathic terminology that not everyone is acquainted with.

    The Nosode list (very long!), I'm still working on.

    Karolina:

    1. I seem to recall hearing that some of the remedies are from another
    company other than Heel. If so, can you provide a .pdf for that manual just
    like we have for the Heel Manual? And a list of which remedies are from
    that other company? I like to do in depth research and find it is helpful
    to go to the source.

    2. I have a list of Composites and Homaccords that are supposed to be in
    the Chiren. Since there is no way to post attachments on the forum, I’m
    sending them to you by email. Would you please look them over for accuracy?
    There are some supports that are not listed as either a Homaccord or
    Composite. It would be helpful to know, for certain, if they are single
    consistent remedies. If so, I’d like to know the complete name of those few
    remedies since indications for treatment can very different among the
    different forms of a remedy. (You mentioned above that you would be
    providing names for constituents within composites and Homaccords). - I’m
    referring to remedies that are neither one of those but are a single remedy
    with no other ingredients.

    3. For instance Discus is not on that list of composites or homaccords. And
    it is not listed as a composite or homaccord in the manual. Does that mean
    it is a single remedy? For some time now I’ve been working under the
    premise that when I’ve been giving Discus that I’ve been giving all the
    other remedies that are included in the composite form. There is a HUGE
    difference between a single ingredient and a composite that may have 20-30
    different remedies included in it. I really need to know, as soon as
    possible, if the Discus in the Chiren is a single remedy or composite. And
    which other supports are not composites or homaccords..

    4. I’m making up Chikey cards and really need to be able to look this
    information up in the Heel manual. That way if a remedy is a composite I
    may be able to free up some slots for other remedies. I feel handicapped
    without a clue as to whether the remedies I’m giving are single remedies or
    composites or homaccords. And if they are single remedies, I need to know
    their technical/complete name since they different indications for
    treatment. It’s possible that I may need to remake some Chikey cards based
    on your answer. This is because I’ve sometimes been giving, what I think is
    a composite, when it might have really been a single remedy.

    5. Please let me know if the two lists I’m emailing you, and that have been
    getting circulated among therapists, is accurate so I know how to proceed
    with giving treatments and making Chikey cards.

    1. Everything that doesn't come from Heel in the Chiren is from Stauphen
    Pharma, many remedies -especially nosodes- are not available anymore in
    Germany due to new regulations. But we can look at the offered descriptions
    in available homeopathic materia medicae, since most remedies are/were
    commonly used by homeopaths. For remedies that can't be found this way the
    descriptions of symptoms caused by the diseases given by medical literature
    can be used as indications. 
    With nosodes the principle is very easy... whatever the symptoms the
    disease gives, the nosodes have an action on...

    2, 3, 4, 5 I'm sure the file that is going to be send around will answer
    most of these questions.

    Do the Kidneys have to be clear several sessions before working on
    appendicitis (intestines)?
  • 
    SVitale
    June 2015 Flag
    I would suppose so, since the toxins discharged will have to go thru the
    Kidney.  I have seen, though, that putting in Appendix Necroticans will
    often result in improved Kidney readings.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    June 2015 edited June 2015 Flag
    The Kidneys are an exit channel just as well as the Intestines are. They
    always need attention first, but there will be plenty of space to address
    the Intestines also. You don't treat just one layer. The idea is to limit
    your focus and work your way down through the layers, but you will need to
    treat more layers than just one at a time. All organ systems interact and
    influence each other. It is most important to take a helicopter view and
    put all these elements together...

    When there is Appendicitis, as Stephano mentions, this will usually have an
    effect on the Kidneys too. So in that case it is not even possible to
    correct only the Kidneys first and then go to Appendicitis the next
    session. 
  •

    Thanks so much for clarifying. I have tried to address Appendicitis
    Necroticans after clearing hormonal system early on if it is measured.
  • 
    katkat
    June 2015 Flag
    Without knowing what is blocked in other Meridians it would be very hard to
    clear even the first layers. We need our clues (drops) from all Organ
    Systems. And with using that information for finding fitting remedies; we
    authomatically clear up a lot for many layers with still our focus on
    clearing in the right order.
    Since our body is an organism of different organs working together, they
    need eachother.
  • 
    Candace Hsiao Young
    June 2015 Flag
    Yes, the helicopter view. So, is it alright then to clear Strep or Staph,
    too, early if those are affecting most meridians? They are usually measured
    along Heart meridian but when I've measured it on myself and family members
    seems it is disturbing overall health at that time.
  • 
    SVitale
    June 2015 Flag
    Strep and Staph are often found first, according to protocol, in Kidney. 
    The other systems that these two bacteria effect are Lymph, Bladder, Lung
    and Heart.  So it often occurs that when you clear the Kidney of these you
    clear them in the rest of the organs/bladders.  It occurs, in my work,
    though, that it comes up again in the secondary systems (Lymph, Bladder,
    etc) and I wonder if this is due to reinfection or to the traveling of the
    bacteria after the Kidney is cleared.?  Any insights?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    Strep and Staph are a very rare find on the Kidneys... 
  • 
    SVitale
    June 2015 Flag
    That's good to know, the Remedy Book does not highlight whether the organs
    it is most common to, it just list the organ systems it has been found in. 
    That would be a good asset to Biontology.  I don't recall if it ever came
    up as a Kidney remedy but I check it on the Kidney since it is listed as
    one of the possibilities.  I'll make a note of that, thank you.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    June 2015 edited June 2015 Flag
    I would stick to the order of testing as given in the measurement protocol.
    This way you will get to know which remedies are most likely to be measured
    on an organ system. The remedy book only lists possible organ systems...
    not if it is measured few or many times on these systems.

  • 
    Candace Hsiao Young
    June 2015 Flag
    Thank you both. It has been confusing for me when a client presents with
    severe symptoms, including fever. I am tempted to first clear Step and
    Staph if measured but will also make a note to stick strictly to protocol.
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    June 2015 edited June 2015 Flag
    I do not consider fever a severe symptom. It means that the body is
    reacting to problems, and this is a healthy immune response.

    High temperature of the body is not necessarily fever. It can also be, and
    this happens more and more, that the temperature regulation of the body is
    off. And this is controlled by the Hormone System.

    If you just follow the protocol, you do the body more good.

    Good Morning.  Back in December the update originally sent to us was 1.0
    but later that morning Lillia sent a corrected update 0.9c so Renate I am
    wondering if that was the one that is in your Chiren and you are having the
    same issue as Johan mentioned?  Since its not working for anyone it really
    is not important but I thought it might help clarify.

    Lillia sent out instructions on how to upload to the Chiren on her email
    dated 12/10/12.  Here is a copy of the email that Lillia sent with the
    instructions on how to upload onto the Chiren.

    "I hereby send you:

    1) the update for hands and feet to change your Chiren. There will be new
    maps appearing in your Chiren.

         in order to update your Chiren:

    load the
    update from this email on to a Thumbdrive. Be aware that not all
    thumbdrives seem to work. We have no idea why, but it appears as if the
    thumbdrives with smaller memory work better. It might be the chips in
    the thumbdrives that make the difference.

    Then sticj
    the thumbdrive in one of the slots in your Chiren. Only then start up
    the Chiren, using the ADMIN CARD(without Admin Card the Chiren will not
    update)..

    Go to
    "SYSTEM UPDATE", then press "SYSTEM", then press "UPDATE SYSTEM", then
    press "UPDATE BY USB DRIVE". then follow the instructions and press OK.
    If everything goes well, the system will shut down and update. You can
    then start up again and the new maps will appear.

    If they are not updated, repeat the procedure. If it still does not work,
    try a different Thumbdrive."

    I hope this helps!  Looking forward to the new update. Thanks Johan for
    trouble shooting this :)

    I got the name of the file from a file that was still on my thumb drive and
    assumed that it is the same one that I installed. However, I believe that I
    installed the most recent update that Lillia sent out in December and would
    need to look it up in my Chren to be certain.  How do I do that?  And if
    there is ever a need to uninstall an update, I'd like to know how to do
    that too. Thanks.

    Hi

     

    Lillia sent out an update with the maps for the Chiren, but that was
    premature. If you have installed that one, this new update (with the same
    number) will not take. I have the same problem. Ihave asked the
    manufacturer for a solution but the one he gave me last night does not seem
    to work. I am working on it but it is a bit slow because of the time
    difference.

    Just to clarify updates:

    update- 1.00.00 is to change your chiren from codes to remedies when
    it first arrives in the U.S  

    update- 0.90.25 was the updated hand & feet charts from December, 2012  

    update-0,90 (3).25 is the most recent Chikey update.  Johan has found that
    the people that have downloaded the update from December are having
    problems downloading this one.

    I had difficulty loading my Chiren so here are the instructions that helped
    me accomplish it.  Also make sure that there are no other updates on your
    USB drive.

    1.  Insert USB drive into the USB port of the Chiren
    2.  Turn on your Chiren
    3.  Insert Admin card
    4.  Double click on the white area of the screen
    5.  Click 'System Setup'
    6.  Click 'System'
    7.  Click 'Update System'
    8.  Click 'Update by USB drive'
    9.  Remove USB drive and Reinsert it
    10.  Click 'OK'
    11.  Restart
    12.  Remove USB drive
    13.  Remove Admin card
    14.  Verify installation is completed by 'clicking' on the green remedy
    slots.  Then Click on 'Own'.  Look at categories on the bottom.  'ChiKey
    Card' will be located at the far right of the word 'Read'.

after....

Other concerns:
She drives a hybrid!

Questions:
1) Is there anything in particular that I should look for or use to help her
body recover from this? (aside from usual testing)

2) Do you have a recommendation for how soon after surgery she should be

    1. Treat with the normal Jaw Remedies (Kieferostitis, Granuloma Denti,

    cannot remove the energetic ones.

Skin lesions => all over
Severe diarrhea => for almost 6 weeks in april, lost kilo's of weight now skin
over bones. 
Severely swollen ankles and lower legs => pores of one leg are leaking fluid 

Medication:
Is using her 6th tube of different skin medication => not helping. 

Diagnostic tests:
Scabies test => negative.

1st Session

Measurement:
Impossible to measure…

    Since you could not measure it was a good decision to give a Whiplash and
    Spin Inversion treatment anyway.

    Peter is right that you forgot to use Anti-Tetanus and Poliomyelitis in
    your first Session. 

    Answer:
    To resolve the edema and leaking of fluid, I suggest that you focus on
    Circulation/Veins the next session(s). Measurements should get better when
    the edema improves.

    Thanks both. I didn't forget the Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus. Lady said
    she never had vaccinations and she couldn't recall ever having had tetanus,
    although I believe she may have because of the surgery.

    Since she suffered so much from itching and having so many heart problems
    and had no measurements I focused on those parts.

    Question:
    How often can I treat her, can I do this every 4 days or should there be
    more time in between, thinking of her age?

    Thank you Riette, good to know she never had vaccinations. This is
    important information that in future cases you can mention under the header
    "medical interventions". The more information we have the better we can
    comment on a case.

    Answer:
    More is usually not better and especially in her weakened condition (old
    age + weak circulation) you don't want to overburden her. I suggest you
    treat her once a week, so she has enough time to rest in between sessions.

    Thanks Karolina, will try to remember to mention that.
    Just learned that she's hospitalised for her legs,hmm.
    But for the hart condition she improved because she could walk the same
    distance in hospital without having to stop 4 times, according to her
    daughter.

    Think it will take a little longer before I will be able to treat her.

    2. The Hormone System plays a role in every condition, that's why the
    protocol is created in a way that it should always be corrected first...

    More direct Causes could be Circulation, Kidney or Metabolism in general.

Locked out of Chiren

Daniel O'Driscoll
January 2015 in Technical Questions Flag
I was wanting to change my password so went into admin with my admin card (gold
symbol towards the one on Chiren)  I could not find any instructions in the
class manual. I unfortunately do not remember how I did what I did, but now I'm
locked out of my Chiren. It will load up to the sign in page but after that
nothing. Pushing the name or secret button just below the time/date at the left
of the name does nothing. Also pushing the shut down button does not work. I
have tried many different combinations, with admin card, with out, pressing
firmly with thumb twice and searching slightly different spots, but still
locked out.  
Please help.
Thanks

This discussion was created from comments split from: New Remedy Update.

you please describe these remedies: Uric Acid, Myristica Sebifera, Zincum
Valerianicum, Radium Bromatum?"

    The 4 remedies have proven value for the following indications (that is why
    they were added even though they are not in the remedy book):

    URIC ACID - Symptom treatment in rheumatoid arthritis and gout 
    MYRISTICA SEBIFERA - Support in case of (jaw) abscesses and boils 
    ZINCUM VALERIANICUM - Strong relaxant
    RADIUM BROMATUM - In case of exposure to radioactive radiation (should be
    handled like a nosode)

    Questions:
    1. How are these remedies classified and used? 
    2. Are they homeopathic or not? 
    3. Which meridians do they affect? (Myristica for Stomach/Jaw point, Uric
    Acid for Kidney/Bladder, Zincum for Gallbladder/Nervous System)
    4. Do we use Radium in addition to Causticum?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    Answers:

    1. Uric Acid and Radium Bromatum fall in the category of Nosodes/Toxins, so
    they should always be measured in line with the protocol.
    Myristica Sebifera and Zincum Valerianicum are Support remedies.

    2. All 4 remedies are homeopathic remedies.

    3. Uric Acid => you are looking for the deposits, so measure on Joints,
    Blood (Circulation) or Connective Tissue
    Myristica Sebifera => can show up on any of the Stomach points when there
    are tooth abscesses.
    Zincum Valerianicum => can be used as support to relax without measuring,
    but I have found it on Adrenal Glands and Gallbladder meridian
    Radium Bromatum => can show up on any organ system that has been exposed to
    radioactivity, but especially on the Hormone System. This is a remedy that
    actually carries information of radioactivity, while Causticum only deals
    with consequences of exposure to radioactivity.

    4. Radium Bromatum is the remedy to assess and treat exposure to
    radio-activity, and Causticum is the remedy that then is used as support to
    deal with the consequences.

    In the Heel book, it quite often lists Traumeel for many various issues. Is
    this as valuable as they seem to suggest? 
  •

    November 2014 edited November 2014 Flag
    Traumeel is a Compositum and as such mainly supportive.

    The only components that you cannot find in any other remedy are Achillea
    Millefolium D3 and Bellis Perennis D2. Maybe these remedies can be useful
    in some cases of physical trauma. 

    If you want to try, I believe this remedy is still available so you could
    make your own Chiren remedy out of it.

    This means the update did not take… It is important that you have the

    memory space. 

    Myristica Sebifera was shared among practitioners a lot, so I think you got
    this remedy through a Chiren card.

    Karolina, in your experience, what is the therapeutic difference between
    Montmorillonite and Radium Bromatum?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    March 2015 edited March 2015 Flag
    They have a completely different field of action. 

    I have not measured the need for Radium Bromatum often, but when I did
    there was a known exposure to a source of radioactivity (after
    verification). It shows up in the organ system that has been affected by
    the radiation.

    Montmorrillonite is mainly useful after prolonged exposure to GSM
    radiation. When I measure this remedy, it is on the Hormone System.

    Because Zincum Valernianicum is a combined remedy, it would be helpful for
    the individual ingredients to be listed with their potencies separately.

    Does the Valerianicum have mother tincture only?  Or also D6?

    Is the Zincum just the single potency of D6?

ALS

I have had an inquiry about treating ALS.  
Does anyone have any experience treating it?

    I have treated 4 ALS clients 2 with very good results and 1  who feels much
    better after every treatment and is holding her own and one who is using a
    multitude of practitioners and it is moving slowly. Too much to write but
    we could talk on the phone sometime.

    I think it would be very interesting to a lot off practitioners to hear
    about your result. I have treated an ALS client to the point of no drop but
    se never recovered the illness. Would love to hear exctaly what did the
    trick for your success.

    Yes, Jan, if you get the time, it would be great to hear. My mother died of
    ALS five years ago, and since my training, I have done a lot of research
    and can see that the message system running through our bodies to our
    brain, nerves, organs, etc. can be blocked by many different disturbances
    in our environment. It is more than likely a different cause for each
    person, as it begins in different areas in the body.

    My mother had "ALOT" of dental work and many small disturbances over the
    years, as an indication (the flashing red light that Johan speaks of) that
    this was disturbing to her body. She had traveled to Africa on a mission
    trip, receiving many immunizations, a few years before ALS became apparent.
    She also had a sad childhood, and I wondered how that may have played a
    part in the manifestation of this illness. Hers began in her legs.

    Will appreciate if you are able to take the time to share more.

Withdrawal: Benzodiazepine - Antipsychotic

slevarekslevarek
June 2014 edited June 2014 in Medication Flag
Recently I have been working directly with patients from clinics dealing with
withdrawal of Prescription Drugs. The clinic is trying to detox each patient
while at the same time reducing the intake of the prescription drug, weaning
them off the RX drug slowly.
Most patients were treated with the Chiren with great results. The clinic is
amazed at how these woman are getting relief. However, this last one is a
challenge for me.. 

The following description is similar to what I am getting from each new person
the clinic sends to me. However, the others are responding so much more quickly
from the sessions this client. 


Client:
Mother of 2 young children, very health oriented. We have had 4 sessions.

Medication:
ZOLOFT (Sertraline) => prescribed by doctor for dizziness/balance problems => 
heavy reaction: anxiety, and severe restlessness day and night
ATIVAN (Lorazepam) => prescribed (couple of weeks after the Sertraline) to deal
with anxiety, and sleeplessness => this medication masked the pain of the
ZOLOFT reaction..

History:
No metal in the mouth
Balance problems and dizziness => started 3 months after birth of 2nd child =>
doctor prescribed ZOLOFT and ATIVAN
Stopped ZOLOFT "cold turkey" => nervous system went crazy, heart palpitations
all night, pain all the time since this time, feels as if she is going to die..
19 months now with all the symptoms below.

Symptoms:
Burning heart area
Absolutely not sleeping for 3 weeks straight => pacing the floor
Electrical sensations => brain area (like blowing a fuse) and lighting bolts
running through the body..
Aching => all over
Major headaches

Treatment:
Standard protocol => 3 sessions.

1st Session
Vaccines + support remedies..

Result:
Felt a relief right away with her headaches.


2nd Session
Gallbladder and Liver
Pancreas - Lead
Nervous System - Mercury and Aluminum
Stomach
Spleen
Circulation

Caenothus, Aurumheel, Aesculus, Atropium, Placenta


3rd Session
Symptoms: severe diarrhoea => no surprise considering all of the vitamins she
gets at the clinic (High Niacin, vitamin C drips.. etc..)

Neutralization: Lorazepam (she still takes a small dosage at night) and Zoloft
(she's not taking this anymore). 


Medical Blood Test: 
Mercury, Lead, Aluminum, Barium and Arsenic

We want to get her a Chikey to give her support remedies..etc.. but after this
test result.. they are wondering.


Question:
1. Why does Mercury, Aluminum and Lead show up when these were neutralized on
the second and third sessions? I need a better understanding with these drugs.

2. Do these drugs have mercury or lead in them?

3. Since she is still taking the Lorazepam (Ativan).. could this be where the
aluminum is coming from?

4. Where does Arsenic come in?

5. I have so many questions about these drugs and how I can help them with the
CHIREN.. Does anyone have suggestions or experience with such sessions? I
welcome anyones advice..

    When you do not work in line with the protocol your results will be far
    from optimal and you will also risk the welfare of your clients. To improve
    results you need to get a better understanding of how to work with the
    body.

    Heavy metals showing up in the blood means that the body has not released
    them because it COULD not.
    The severe diarrhoea is also an example of a panic reaction of the body.

    The information you gave about your measurements and treatments is far from
    complete, but enough to see some big discrepancies from the protocol (see a
    to d):

    a. Only vaccinations that are measured should be treated in the first
    session (usually no more than 3)

    b. Yang organs need to be corrected first, BEFORE any heavy detoxing like
    you stimulated with the Heavy Metal remedies. Pancreas and Nervous System
    are not yang organs!

    c. Neutralization of medication that is still used (Lorazepam) should never
    be done. I does not help in any way and only burdens the body more.

    d. Neutralization of medication that is not taken anymore but is still in
    the body (Zoloft) can be done once, but never in a stage where the yang
    organs are not ready yet. Usually the neutralization is not necessary all
    together as the body will start detoxifying the drugs by itself when all
    excretion organs have improved enough.

    You need to have patience with your clients and especially should not push
    too much detox too early on in treatment. So no Heavy Metals, Liver
    Nosodes, or Toxins in the first couple of treatments. It is absolutely
    essential that you clear all Yang organs first before starting any detox.

    Thank you for your reply,

    Additional information:

    2-7 standard program:
    Wifi Electric remedy session

    2nd Session
    Results previous session:
    Relief in the brain for the first time

    1st measurement:
    Spin Inversion and Whiplash

    2nd measurement:
    Fire, 
    Wood, 
    Water, 
    Metal, 
    Earth 
    Circulation

    >12 years Treatment:

    3rd measurement:
    Only drops on Liver

    Footplates:
    Cerebrum, Viscum, Thalamus, Hepar, Apis, Atropinum, Ozaliet

    4th measurement:
    No drops


    3rd Session
    Measured all points => neutralized the word for the 2 drugs => Zoloft did
    not improve measurements, but Lorazepan did

    Interview:
    She mentioned having severe diarrhea => hard to tell what causes this since
    she does so many things

    Still getting Lorazapen every night, reduced, but still receiving it.
    (other clients were able to get off the med after 3 sessions, not so with
    this client) She is so afraid to stop it all together.

    Session she has every day in the detox clinic:
    Infra-Red Saunas
    Drips
    High dosages of Vitamins (e.g. niacin)
    Photon light sessions! => with this Photon Genius machine (everyone had a
    bad reaction to this)

    So many sessions are done in this clinic that she is complaining about
    them…

    1st Measurement:
    Nervous System
    Circulation
    Water
    Earth
    Metal

    >12 years Treatment:
    Caenothus, Camplybact Pylori (still showed up), Billiary Cirrhosis
    (Gallbladder). Arumuheel, Aesculus, Atoprimum, Placenta, Bacterium Lactis
    (diarrhea) Diarrheel

    2nd Measurement:
    No drops

    Footplates:
    Boab, StarBethlehem, Brornia, Fringe Violet, Cerebrum, Viscum & Thalamus

    Symptoms:
    Feels like something happened to her brain, like there are scars on her
    brain,
    Pain => back of the neck, top of the head

    Comments and Questions:
    1. In the 2nd session, the Endocrine system did not show drops when I began
    with the Yang Organs.
    Maybe I did Heavy Metals too soon with them on the Nervous System. And if
    they are in fact going through detox programs at the clinic, it will have
    an effect on my measure as well.. right?

    2. It's better I just give them more support then to give Nosodes or Heavy
    Metals.. cause now she wants me to do them all.. 

    3. My client has ordered the CHIKEY. What REMEDY cards would be the best
    for this type of situation? Of course, she is wanting all the metals on a
    card.. I won’t do that, you understand people really do not understand how
    the CHIKEY works. Another person did buy the CHIKEY in this clinic. She is
    feeling such relief.

    4. What about a Circulation card? 
    Maybe support remedies for the Stress and Sleep.. 
    The EMF card..

    5. I do realize that with all the detox they are doing that I have to be
    careful with the sessions with her.


    Additionally:
    A couple of my clients were taken to this other Biophoton Light session (
    $35) where you stand in this photon light to help the Detoxing. They all
    got very sick afterwards.. 
   
    It is called "PHOTON GENIUS LIGHT" Therapy .
   
    Question:
    6. What exactly does this do? I am not familiar with these instruments that
    give one LIGHT as such. 
   
    To book a stay in one of these Alternative to Meds Clinics.. people are
    paying $20,000 a month.
    And the first relief they have received, they tell me, is with the CHIREN.

    Additional symptoms my client mentioned today:
    "Crackling" and "popping" sensations in the brain => damaged nervous system
    (she thinks)
    Difficulty focusing => problem started after taking Zoloft and is still
    there
    Pain in the heart => feels like "hot pokers" right into the centre of the
    heart.
    Electrical current sensations => running through her arms and legs 

    Question:
    1. Do you have remedy suggestions for a Chikey-card, to alleviate these
    symptoms?
    2. As these clients are "weaning" themselves off the RX drug, is there
    anything we can offer to give relief from the discomfort they get ?

    I think you should stay to protocol as Johan described, work on the terrain
    and especially support the Adrenals.

    The treatment of Heavy Metals and more is far to early.

    These clients experience a great deal of stress. I feel it is important to
    address that and learn your client to be grounded. Maybe you can teach some
    basic meditation techniques for relaxation. 

    I think there is much fire in the system. 

    She might have a lot of ideas about her condition, but instead of going
    along with her thinking, you need to lead her to what are the best for her.
    Try to get her of the vitamins since they don't help her anyway.

    Comments:
    a) What is an "electric remedy session"? 

    b)  Why do you do an extra 2-7 Treatment? This is totally unnecessary and
    not indicated in the protocol. The protocol states to only treat with one
    Standard Hand Session and one Standard Footplate Session. 

    The only exception is when the Kidneys or Hormone System are not corrected
    after the Footplate Session, but this will not happen when you are
    experienced at working with the protocol. This exception was introduced to
    be certain students won't make the mistake of sending people home with
    drops on the Kidneys or Hormone System.

    c) Can you explain which organs are meant by the Fire, Wood, etc elements.
    You mention all elements. If really all organs dropped, then you need to
    take a totally different approach.
    In the 3rd session you do not mention Wood, but then list Billiary
    Cirrhosis as matching on the Gallbladder meridian?
   
    d) Did you measure Spin Inversion and Whiplash two times? Or did you just
    treat them. When Whiplash is corrected it usually doesn't show up a second
    time unless there's a direct cause (yoga, sports, a fall, etc). If this is
    not the case you need to look for other causes that make the Thyroid and
    Parathyroid drop.

    e) Because there is Appendicitis, there must be a lack of Intestinal
    Bacteria in the colon, these Bacteria probably match on the Bladder thus
    rectifying the cause. This could also help the headaches but you do not
    indicate where in the head the headaches are, so I do not know if they are
    caused by the Bladder meridian.
   
    f) Your client's difficulty with focussing could also be caused by the lack
    of Intestinal Flora. This could also cause things like "brain fog". When
    there is Chronic Appendicitis in the first session, this is not completely
    gone in the 2nd and 3rd. And after Appendicitis is gone there is always a
    need for the Intestinal Flora Bacteria… So this whole process will take a
    couple of sessions...

    g) When following protocol, the Heavy metals will normally not be ready to
    be addressed until about the 6th session. There are still far too many
    drops on all systems to address the Heavy Metals.
   
    h) If people do not sleep for a number of weeks, their electrolytes are
    totally off, Then you really need to balance minerals in the physical body,
    especially potassium. In this case I would suggest colloidal minerals
    (liquid form without any unnatural additions). And of course in the
    Biontology session you need to support the Adrenals.

    i) I don't know the Genius, but it does not use biophotons, it generates
    photons. Obviously it does nothing good. I am sorry to hear that these
    people pay such bad symptoms.

    j) I think it is better not to alleviate symptoms without doing something
    about the Cause. You need to find this first and then you can support at
    the same time.
   
    k) The client should get relief from symptoms once you remove the Cause.
    Look at what meridians run on the locations she has pain. Pain is almost
    always caused by meridians. Treating meridians locally with a short program
    (no remedies!) or several times with the Whiplash program (no remedies!)
    often alleviates pain symptoms too, without masking the Cause… You can
    advise your client to use the Chikey for these local treatments.
   
    l) Most important is to get the organs right in the right sequence as
    indicated in the protocol.

    m) I am glad you used the names and not the actual medication, since names
    will never detox the actual substance, and since it is far too early to
    stimulate detox anyway (I believe all the clinic is doing is damaging
    too..). Names are useless in neutralizing drugs, but you should not
    neutralise the drugs anyway in this stage.

    n) I do not see a need in your measurements to support with Cerebrum,
    Thalamus and Viscum every time. When you do treat with Heavy Metals it
    makes more sense to support the Kidneys.

    o) When you treat Chronic Appendicitis it is important to add acute
    Appendicitis, to make sure you won't get a flare up when the chronicity
    turns into an acute infection.

    p) It is not helpful at all that your clients are doing all these different
    treatments, but I do see the difficulty in addressing this, since you are
    working with this clinic and these clients are referred to you. I do not
    see a solution for this, and since you are getting results… 

    q) It might be that the Spin Inversions are caused by the Infra Red
    therapy, so you can also advise to regularly run Spin Inversion Programs
    with the Chikey.

    Hi Sandra,

    I can see the dilemma here… working with a clinic that does all these
    things that might not be very helpful. If you convince your client to stop
    these sessions, they might not be so happy anymore referring clients to you
    and then you would not be able to help all these people you are helping
    right now… Difficult!

    But well, you are getting them off of their meds faster. It must be great
    to help these people who are prisoners of the pharmaceutical industry ;-). 

    Working with a better understanding of the Biontology protocols might speed
    things up even more and make transition more gentle… I am working on
    creating an guideline that is a bit more complete and also integrates the
    treatment part too. The measurement protocol was created as a tool to help
    with the order of measurement, since after the training few people knew "
    where to go first" and "what remedies to look for first". Designing a
    treatment protocol is even more challenging… but I can see the need for
    it. 

    Until then I hope you will read other cases and comments too, since all
    aspects that need to be understood about the right order of treatment are
    available on the forum.

    Hello Karolina,
    I have a question concerning the client above.. She has now left the
    clinic, returned to Canada, bought a Chikey for support sessions.
    She just wrote to me asked if I could make a remedy card for this physical
    pain in her heart ..She says ever since she took those drugs, the
    benzoneoprines.. heart has been hurting.. 
    What would you suggest after what I have written above..  I know it a
    challenge but there must be something I can offer her for this pain.
    Thanks for your feedback.

    Most of the benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, including the cramping, are
    all Gallbladder system related.  

    To relieve the heart pain due to coronary cramping I would use these 8
    remedies on the card: 
    Gallbladder support remedies: Atropinum, Chelidonium, Injeel Chol, Cuprum,
    Spascupreel 
    To support further detoxification: Galium
    These Heart remedies that have the best indications for chest pain: Angio
    Injeel, Cardiacum

Stroke and Paralysis - Can Biontology Help?

joellegoldmanjoellegoldman
February 2013 edited January 2014 in General Questions Flag
This woman would like to be treated. She is in a revalidation center, but I
would like to organize that a biophoton therapist comes to see her. 
I’m still a student and don’t feel comfortable jet with this case. 
My question: Can Biontology do something for her?

Information:

1. Female patient, aged 58, woke up and could not move legs – she was diagnosed
with a blood clot in her under legs and operated successfully the same day,
November 1st, 2012

2. After a few days she got a stroke: a blood clot blocking the right part of
the brain; thereafter she developed pneumonia and was in the IC unit for
several weeks

3. She is now in a revalidation center and her remaining symptoms are:
- paralysis of the left side (arm and leg)
- Flex contraction of the left knee (the left knee cannot be stretched
completely)
- Aphasia: speech muscles are ok and she can make sounds, but the brain cannot
form the words and she realizes that
- She gives signs of good understanding, but responding even by yes and no and
writing intelligently is hard
- Large longitudinal scars on both sides of each under leg
- Large pains, which seem to have lessened recently

4. Long history: she was born with a hole in the atrium as well as in one of
the heart valves; she has been operated successfully about 7 years ago. After
operation she developed atrial fibrillation that later could be stopped. 

Short history: she was stressed, had pain in her under legs and had developed
atrial fibrillation, less than about a month before

    Hi Joelle

    All seems to be caused by the Blood Circulation.

    She can definitely benefit from treatment:

    1) Whiplash first, then all the Scars
    2) Triple Warmer meridian
    3) Circulation: Calcification clearance, also possible Gallbladder
    remedies. Measure what is needed.
    4) Gallbladder is responsible for thrombocytes(blood clotting platelets)

    She will get better functions from the moment the bloodvessels are clear.
    This might take up to 10 treatments.

Only Temporary Relief - What Am I Missing?

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
February 2014 edited February 2014 in Q&A Flag
Anonymous Questions:

1. A number of Clients who did so very well, come back 4 or 6 weeks later with
same knee, back problems that were resolved and are returning again.
My own back is a perfect example, when I'm treated I am in super shape. This
lasts for a month or 6 weeks, then I am back at square…. well not 1, but about
3. 
What am I missing or doing incorrectly ?

2. When my Clients leave, and have improved with their physical pains, I feel
that with some (not all) I am leaving a door open in their system, like there
is a draft, something is incomplete when I am done with them. I feel that I
should be sealing something?
Completing something.

3. How long should I or the Client expect to be free of their issues like knee,
back, physical problems?

    Answers:

    1 & 2 The reason for things coming back is that the Cause has not been
    solved. You probably focus too much on the Symptom and not on the Cause.
    The Symptom can only be solved permanently when the Cause has been healed.

    Let's take the back/knee issue as an example:
    Issues of both back and knee(s) has two possible Causes:
    1) problem in the Bladder System => energetic/meridian problem
    2) problem in the Bone/Cartilage => physical problem
    Very often those two things go together.

    If we are dealing with the second problem (Bone/Cartilage):

    1. The Calcium Metabolism needs to be restored first => correct Parathyroid
    => but remember that when the functions of Parathyroid and the other
    Hormonal Glands have been restored, it does not mean that the physical has
    been restored.
    2. Give it Time => there must be a lot of Physical Healing done before the
    problem has been solved and this will take Time. If and when the body
    starts and continues healing, depends on the Life Style and on the question
    if the Hormonal System remains balanced.
    3. Change Lifestyle => Lifestyle is always a big issue. Generally people
    must change their Lifestyle in order to achieve a lasting healing. Many
    people have the habit of exhausting themselves in their daily life. This
    automatically leads to malfunctions in the Hormonal System and the body 
    stops healing and falls back.
    4. Monitor the Hormone System => Healing of the Bones/Cartilage can take a
    couple of months, IF the body does not experience further problems.

    In the case that the Back/Knee problems are caused by the Bladder Meridian,
    the problem might be more complicated.

    1. Find the Cause => The bladder meridian involves the Physical Bladder,
    the Ovaries and the Uterus (or Prostate/Testis in men). Each and every one
    of them have their own Causes. And these Causes are Symptoms of different
    Causes again. Plus there are always other factors that weigh in on the
    disturbances, like Appendix and the Tonsils. In these cases there generally
    is also a Lifestyle Issue. Here you truly need to apply Synthesis Thinking
    (see below)

    2. Treat the Cause => In any case, do not Mask any problem by treating
    symptomatically. To combat a problem, you have to bring it out in the open
    so that one knows what you have to fight and look at the all from an
    objective point of view.

    3 & 4 (changing lifestyle and monitoring if the measurements stay correct)
    apply here too.


    Synthesis Thinking

    * To see all the complex relationships you need to really practice
    Synthesis Thinking. This means you'll need to see all the problems in
    combination and how everything works together and how many things influence
    each other. This is where knowledge comes to live and becomes Knowing and
    Understanding. There needs to be an integration of all aspects.

    * I've come to see that Synthesis Thinking is still not understood or
    applied by most practitioners. It is a subject that seems very difficult to
    transfer. Most people by now have some understanding of all the various
    subjects that are important to Biontology, but they do not integrate them.

    * For Synthesis Thinking we need to integrate (not pick at random and
    forget the rest…) 
    a) Symptoms, 
    b) Measurements, 
    c) Lifestyle 
    d) Environment, 
    e) Acupuncture /TCM, 
    f) Homeopathy, 
    h) Physical Anatomy, Physiology, 
    i) Energetic Anatomy, Physiology, 
    j) Emotional Symptoms, 
    k…..z) and probably many more.

    * One needs to have this Information. If Information is lacking, then you
    might come to different conclusions.

    * One needs also a Helicopter View of all, which means no preconceived
    ideas or judgments, either general or specific.

    * When Synthesis Thinking is understood, it is also understood what
    information is important when asking questions about a patient. Asking good
    questions is a major part of Synthesis Thinking.
   
    * Many questions on the Forum are very difficult to answer for me because I
    lack information….
    I immediately see quite a few questions that I need answers to before I can
    come up with any case-specific advice. There are always many, many
    possibilities.
   
    * What I often find when I ask important questions about a case, that no
    answer comes. I think this is because the practitioner did not ask these
    questions themselves. 
    But again, most patients do not realise the answers to these questions
    either because they live totally unaware.

    * Biontology is a life-long process of Studying, Practice and an Eternal
    Questioning Mind. It never stops.

Chemical & EMF Sensitivity - Methylation Cycle

slevarekslevarek
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client: Woman 52, very successful in business world. She went to a clinic in
Dallas, where many persons with such issues go to stay in a sterile
environment, while the doctors do tests on them. It cost a fortune and no one
seems to get well. 

Diagnosis: Methylation Cycle does not work, immune system malfunctions,
detoxification system malfunctions..

Symptoms: Multiple Chemical Sensitivity/EMF Sensitivity - all which began about
2 years ago. Feels she is in a prison (can't go anywhere), though to me she
does not look so bad and she does not appear to me to be so underweight for her
size.. (weighs 89 lbs..) She is very very negative.  She's obsessive in her
thoughts of all the diagnosis that she was given (very difficult). With all of
this in mind.. I began the sessions.

1st session

Spin Inversion - she was in such a spin.. points extremely low sounding,
dropping everywhere
After the Spin Inversion treatment, I could successfully read her points.
Treated her with the Vaccines where needed.. and Heavy Metals

2nd session

Could not get a reading.
I tried to do a Spin Inversion Treatment.. no good.. nothing..
I tried Whiplash Treatment several times.. still not able to read.
I did the "Clearing Aura" treatment you told us about.. (Electro essence, Space
Clearing, Causticum, Ozaliet, and Crab Apple - Short Treatment) but still not
able to read her points.. they all drop.. low sounds

I restarted the Chiren.. still it happened. I was really baffled at what to do.
So I gave her the Dyslexia treatment with the footplates: Electro essence,
Space Clearing, Causticum, Ozaliet, and Crab Apple
After that I was able to measure..

Measurement: Lymphomyosot, Thyroidea, Gloyxal, Selenium, Fibroma Pendulum,
Cuprum, Barijodeel, and Nervoheel

However after this session, once again I could not read her points. She was
ready to stop.. so we stopped..

4 days later..
Same thing happened.. This time I gave her some shungite stones.. to clear the
energy. She did say that for the first time.. she did not react to smells..
Once again we tried a session with the Footplates.. and I was able to read her
points.

3rd session
1st treatment: Thalamus, Plumbum, Nervoheel, Aesculus, Barijodeel, Aurumheel,
Selenium
Measured afterwords.. points did read, and no drops on the Nervous System, nor
on the CS

2nd treatment: Hepatis B, Variolium, Tonsillitis - Triple Warmer, Lymphosot on
the Lymphatic System,

Was able to give the full Dyslexia treatment.. with the standard Cerebrum,
Thalamus, Ozaliet, Viscum

Questions: 
1. I need to know what to do.. She insists I call Johan and he comes to treat
her.. She is very much a controlling person and to be so out of control has her
so depressed. She weighs 89 lbs.. says she is ready to die.
2. Can you give me any help with this one.. on the Methylation Cycle?
3. Why I was unable to read her points?
I tried everything.. Could not get a decent drop of Blood from her finger so we
tried the Spin Inversion treatment using her Saliva. Still was unable to
measure her afterwards.

Any advice/suggestions would be so appreciated.

    First of all.
    Do you really want to continue with this client on her premises? 
    Since you ask for advice, mine would be to voice yourself and may be ask
    her to be quiet and leave the space for the therapy process. 
    If she continue this what I call vampire behavior she will take all your
    energy.

    In my opinion this client is full of toxins, and her kidneys are out of
    their mind.

    Well :) this is feedback from a non-expert biontologist... 
    Honestly, be careful and voice your own boundaries with her.
    What keeps you from letting her go?
    (She has already a need to call someone else... )

    The way I read it, you do to many treatments in one session.

    You also treat with to little space between sessions. There must bee 5 days
    between treatments at least. As Beate tells you must be very much in charge
    with her . 

    For the Dyslexia program there is no standard in a normal treatment. The
    Cerebrum, Thalamus, Viscum (not the Ozaliet) is for people with Dyslexia. 

    Ozaliet is an aura thing. 

    You write: " This time I gave her some Shungite stones". This is not
    something you should do, Johan has made very clear not to mix any other
    things with Biotology.

    Beate:
    Every human being with disease is a "vampire" to some extent and that is
    just the reason why they come to you. The negativity, disappointment,
    desperation.... they're all a part of the imbalance/disease and you could
    consider them a symptoms. If you really can't deal with it, of course you
    can send someone like that away. But it is better to develop skills to deal
    with this attitude, which is "normal" behaviour (a symptom) in certain
    illnesses.
    So although boundaries are very important for a practitioner, I wouldn't go
    into a defensive mode and tell her to leave unless it is very, very bad and
    I can't handle her in any other way. 

    In this case the situation is that the client notes that the practitioner
    has difficulty treating her, which feeds her insecurity of never healing
    again... 
    This is a good starting point to ask her if she has dealt with insecurity
    about her caretakers in more situations in her life. If she was supported
    when she was younger, if she has basic trust..... Biontology means to be
    creative with the information you get and then use the tools that are part
    of this system. Asking questions is a great tool, because the client feels
    listened too and can realise how he/she is experiencing and handling life.

    So this is about Beate's comment on the emotional part. I will look into
    the whole case later and try to formulate some answers on that.

    Peter:
    Thank you, those comments are on the spot. 

    Sandra: 
    Most of the treatment "mistakes" could have been prevented by reading and
    following the whole Measurement Protocol that was send around by Johan.
    The problems with measurement and treatment we'll address in another
    reaction. This takes more time.

    The fact that she was in a Spin Inversion also indicates that she has
    Fatigue. But that is not mentioned as a symptom
    Chemical Sensitivity can be a result of her Burn-Out. It is often a result
    of Spin Inversion

    She has control issues and perfectionism. Probably she is not acknowledging
    she has a Burn-Out and is going on Willpower. Letting go and surrendering
    is a problem for her.

    The measuring problems can be caused by her not carrying much weight. This
    indicates that she has very little skin on her  fingers and toes which
    makes measuring hard.

    I believe letting go (for which she needs some basic trust) will improve C
    irculation, then when she starts controlling her life again she cramps up
    and the Circulation to the Skin stops.

    About your Methylation Cycle - question:
    Methylation is chemical process in the body and usually not something we
    take into consideration in Biontology, but to create a link between the
    chemical and the energetic perspective we can think about this...

    There is more to it, but for a good methylation process in the body,
    availability of the right elements is of the essence. B vitamins (B12, B6,
    Folate) are essential to the methylation process. Under stressful
    circumstances of an emotional or physical nature the need for these
    vitamins is heightened, but at the same time the digestive function doesn't
    work properly (sympathetic activation). 
    So under stress the absorption of nutrients is far from optimal and the
    need is increased... a lack of nutrients also causes stress and
    exhaustion... an imbalance starts and sets one up for chronic disease. 
   
    *The chemical solution that is often offered by other naturopathic
    modalities and which is sometimes helpful to people with a lack of proper
    methylation, is taking high doses of the nutrients needed for this process.
    In Biontology this is not the way to go. We treat on a whole different
    level and supplementing (with anything other than food) would interfere
    with healing.

    *This condition from an energetic, helicopter perspective, would be defined
    as Gallbladder/Liver problems with Adrenal exhaustion and most likely the
    whole digestive tract is affected too. When you get the body balanced
    energetically, stress and tension will be relieved and absorption starts to
    improve. Depending on the severity of the imbalance and on the lifestyle/
    diet (Vegan diet would be a problem) of the client the imbalance will
    resolve over time. 

    A note on the measurement problem:
    If it is not the thin skin that creates the problems it can also be that
    she uses cream/oil on her hands. If this is the case ask her not to do this
    for her next visit and see if measurement is easier that way.

    Thank you Karolina / Johan for your feedback.
   
    The main reason I took this client on .. is because of her sister who is a
    friend of mine.. who I had referred to another practitioner initially. Her
    experience with the Chiren initially was a bad experience and it was me her
    encouraged them to go for sessions since all else has failed for here to
    date.
     
    I simply offered to give it a try myself. She has 2 daughters.. To date,
    they have spent so so much money with no results from traditional medicine.
     I am the kind of a person who does not get caught into the "story" of who/
    what is to blame for their condition. I do understand that it is a fine
    line between what is going on in their head and how it relates to the body.
   
    She is fatigued.. and it is obvious.. underweight.. and she tells me it is
    impossible to drink nor eat.. though she gets up and can walk around just
    fine.. She did eat while i was there.. she does eat meat.. She was obsessed
    with explaining to me about the Methylation Cycle syndrome to me.. 
    Treated her 3 times.. the best I could.. I am waiting to see if they will
    call me back.. Will keep you posted

    Maybe 1 piece in the puzzle...
    One place where there can be a weakness in the methylation cycle is in the
    processing of sulphur.
    If there is a weakness there, than among other things, allergies can
    occur.  Sulfates and sulfites circulate and cause havoc.  Maybe Schwefheel
    will match somewhere...?  Pituitary or?

    good luck... Katherine

    Since Sulphur metabolism (as many processes in the body) is affected by a
    malfunctioning Methylation cycle, Schwefheel might be a remedy that you
    want to test. 
    However Schwefheel usually doesn't match on the Pituitary gland. It is the
    Nervous System that is affected according to Johan and that is why signals
    from the brain are not translated properly into Hormonal Regulation.

    I'm also very interested in hearing the follow up!

    Question about Sulphur:
    We do have Sulphur and Schwefheel in the system, and have been told to use
    Schwefheel, not Sulphur. But when people come back form Hawaii and have
    been exposed to the volcanic ash, breathing it in for weeks is it Sulphur
    then that I would measure to assist getting the Sulphur out of their
    system?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    April 2013 edited April 2013 Flag
    It is a matter of potencies again. The higher potencies should work to get
    Sulphur out of the system, the lower potencies help when there's a lack of
    Sulphur in the body.

    Schwefheel has the higher potencies and should be used in the case of
    volcanic ash exposure. It is created with a potency accord (different
    potencies) of Sulphur. There are no other components in this remedy.

    Sulphur is a Compositum that only has one low potency of Sulphur that will
    only resonate in cases of a lack of Sulphur. This Compositum is created as
    a skin remedy and also has other homeopathic components that are useful for
    skin disease.

Footplate Treatment for Children Under 12

Sharon Werner
November 2014 edited November 2014 in Programs Flag
I was told that children under 12 should only get the hand rods, but I think
the reason for that was that most of the time the child can't sit still long
enough for the Dyslexia program.

Questions:
1. I figure if a child will sit still for the duration of the Dyslexia program,
and I choose to give her this, the child will get better quicker as is the case
with adults. Can I go ahead and treat her with the Foot Plates or is there
another reason for a child under 12 not to get that treatment?

2. Would the Dyslexia program maybe too much for a child under 12 because it 
allows the light to enter unfiltered and for a long time?

Comments

  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    November 2014 Flag
    It is important that the child does not experience any form of stress if it
    needs to sit still. When sitting still for such a long time causes stress,
    the treatment would be counterproductive instead of helpful.

    In general, I only do the Dyslexia treatment for children if they really
    are dyslexic. Dyslexia diagnosis is very controversial. That is why I only
    start the Dyslexia treatments in children once the normal treatments are
    finished. Often this alone gives a lot of improvement.

    Answers:
    1. I find the Dyslexia treatment generally not necessary for children. The
    accumulation of toxins in a child is normally not that high. In my
    experience there is no extra advantage in using this program even when the
    child does not experience stress from sitting that long. Only in adults it
    makes a big difference.
   
    2. Filter can be interpreted two ways… With unfiltered in this context do
    you mean that the Chiren allows the light through on all frequency levels?
    This is correct, but does not have the implications you suggest.
    The other thing you might mean is that in the Dyslexia program there is no 
    biophoton coherency filter, which would be incorrect since there is a
    filter to separate the healthy from the unhealthy light emission. 
    The light treatment with the Dyslexia program is not the problem for
    children however, but do not overdose on remedies by using this extra
    treatment to put more in the slots.

September 2015 - Dialysis

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
September 2015 in Q&A Flag
Question
I received the following question from a potential client:
“I was diagnosed with kidney failure at the beginning of this year, and am now
on the waiting list for a donor kidney. I recently start with continuous
peritioneal dialysis 24 hours a day. The cause is still unclear and I would
like to see whether my Kidney function will improve with biophoton treatment.”

The question is if this is a contra-indication and if it is possible to improve
Kidney function while doing dialysis.

Answer
Dialysis is not a contra-indication and it will also not block treatments.
However, dialysis does damage the blood vessels, so extra care should be taken
to balance both veins and arteries.

    When you say 'extra care' is to be taken, can you expand on this?  Does
    this mean to use more or less support for the circulation, more or less
    nosodes and/or circulation support? 
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    September 2015 Flag
    Sometimes you may choose to not treat Circulation (e.g. when the problem is
    calcification but the Parathyroid is not balanced yet), but in the case of
    dialysis there should be focus on the circulatory meridians. 

    Damage to the small blood vessels in the Kidneys caused by the pressure
    from the dialysis may be helped by using Placenta fore example, but you

    Measure Arteries and Veins and see whether there are drops and what support
    is needed to balance these drops.... you treat with what you measure.

    Is it correct to then understand a situation is one of calcification (after
    the Parathyroid is balanced) when Barijoheel matches on the Arteries?  Or
    are there other ways to understand calcification?

    Barijodeel en Aurumheel are both remedies for calcification. 
    There is not really another way to understand within this system.

Testing Supplements - 2

    One of my clients asked to test for supplement deficiency. 

    Questions:
    1. The following is my current understanding. Are these statements correct?
    A. Testing for deficiency is not possible using the Chiren.
    B. The measurement function of the Chiren is only to find a remedy that
    corrects a point that drops.
    C. If we make a Neutralized Remedy of a supplement, say vitamin C, then
    what it will do is correct a point if it is needed. This does not infer
    that the person needs this supplement but, rather that the inverted,
    neutralized Vit C is needed.  This is a very different meaning. 
    D. If you find that the Nosode, Botulism corrects a dropped point, this
    does not mean that the actual Botulism will be an actual, physical
    supplement for that person.  
   
    2. When one makes a neutralized, inverted remedy of a supplement and it
    corrects a point, what actually is being said?  
   
    3. When you say that you test to see what supplements/medications disturb a
    point, what is actually meant by this is that the supplement is actually
    'harming' the person? 
   
    4. So, the rumor that one can test for deficiencies is really off the mark,
    incorrect?

    What is the point in making a neutralized remedy of a supplement?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel

    Answers
    1A. Correct
    1B. Partly correct. 
    The measurement function of the Chiren is to find which Organ Systems
    function correctly and which do not. The measurement function is also used
    to find the information that can correct malfunctions.
    1C. Possibly a wrong example to illustrate what you mean...
    No system can identify what nutrition supplements a body needs. The
    nutrition supplements are not the body's own and therefore will always
    react in a negative way. The vitamins, minerals only become the body's own
    after digestive processes have been completed.
    I do not see why one would need neutralized vitamin C as a remedy. Vitamin
    C does not store in the body but is readily excreted and thus will not
    become poisonous except for extreme doses are taken.
    1D. A very confusing statement...
    If a nosode matches, it means that this signal can neutralize a disturbance
    in the system. Nosodes can NEVER be seen or used as nutritional supplements

    2. 95% of all nutritional supplements are packaging. If one makes a remedy
    of such a supplement and then measures with it, one almost certainly will
    see a drop.The signals of the packaging are almost certain to override the
    nutritional information. So if you would find that a neutralized remedy of
    the supplement matches this may mean that one experiences disturbances
    caused by something in the supplement.

    3. Medication and supplements always show nothing or they will show drops.
    I have never seen them test positive. Generally points that are good will
    show drops when the supplements or medication are brought into the circuit.
    This is an indication that the supplement or medication may be harmful,
    although it is never the same substance that it will be inside the body
    after digestion.

    4. It is indeed incorrect that one can test for deficiencies, just as it is
    incorrect that one can test for allergies.

    1C.  I use the Vit C as an example, if in fact it was a remedy.  Said in a
    different way, using a neutralized substance, like a nosode, to correct a
    dropped point MEANS that that point and the corresponding point association
    is 'corrected' with that neutralized item.  I seems what this points out is
    the difference between the nutritional substance vs. the nosode.  This is
    not the focus or function of Biontology.
    1D. was said in comparison the !C.  But I think the above statement is what
    I meant to point out.
    3, I think this answer is what the issue is really about - I've heard rumor
    that one can use the Chiren to test for the need for supplements, This is
    clearly not possible. thank you Johan

Liver Question

ecox
April 2013 edited January 2014 in General Questions Flag
Client: 53 year old male.  He has had 3 sessions.

Symptoms: Weak Immune System, Constantly getting Colds, Feeling Cold all the
time for many years.

Recent Situation: This past week he has Clay Colored Stools, Dark Urine and
Sweaty Body. All new Symptoms.

Question:  His doctor wonders if the light treatment could have opened up one
of his Liver Cysts and it was too much for his body to handle. 
Do you think this is possible?  Do you think these Symptoms reflect that? I did
treat with Zirrhose Hepatitis in the last session.

    These are indeed Liver related Symptoms (the recent ones). It seems like
    there's an Obstruction of Bile Flow.

    I don't think this is because of a Liver Cyst opening up.... although it
    could be. How did the doctor come up with that? If it is just a theory I
    wouldn't just go for it. We can make up some theories of our own too.

    How was his Gallbladder the last time you measured. Does he have
    Gallstones? Billiary Cirrhosis?
    If you treat Liver Cirrhosis it might also be, that because of the lifting
    of Suppression, an old Inflammation is activated in the Bile ducts in the
    Liver and that this causes Obstruction. Did you support with Chelidonium?

    I think you really need to focus on the Gallbladder meridian. That's where
    you find the Bile Ducts and use both Nosodes and Support.

    This again shows that it is most important to treat the Yang elimination
    channels first before going to the Big Guy (Liver). I believe you probably
    already did treat it first, but maybe the Gallbladder needed more time to
    heal.... We just don't know...

    You can tell the doctor that the Light Treatment is not known for causing
    anything like this directly, but that it does activate the body to solve
    problems and that sometimes in the attempt of the body to eliminate things
    temporary Symptoms may arise. It is always an Indication of a problem that
    was already there....
    But it is very good that he's being monitored by his doctor though. You
    don't want to be held responsible for anything of this.

    Since I have had my share of doctors opinions the last days, I really think
    some of them (not all) take too big words in their mouth about medical
    connections in the body.

    We do energy treatments, and I believe the body sort this "stress" out by
    itself as long as treated on its own premisses with light. I further
    believe, after many years with chiren and many ups and downs:) that the end
    of the day ......if you keep on the treatments we reach a sort of equlibrum
    and get our viberant health back.

    I have followed the discussion about mixing in other therapies, and I do
    now understand why the chaos have continued in a couple of my clients doing
    acupuncture at the same time. I have asked a few of them to wait at least
    72 hours before seeing someone else. Well that is all I can do.

    Thank you. This is very helpful.

    I did treat the Gallbladder with Billiary Cirrhosis in the previous
    session, but used other Gall Bladder supports.  I did not realize that
    Chelidonium was the key one to use for support for Billiary Cirrhosis. 
    Yes, I think I should have waited to treat the Liver with nosodes.

    He came in today. 

    Symptoms:  Continues to have Clay Colored Stools, Urine is a little
    lighter, alternates between Sweaty and hot or Cold and Shivers, Itchy Skin,
    Congestion

    Findings: Many drops throughout.  Drops in Pineal gland, Large Intestine,
    Nervous System (left) all points, Circulation, Heart, Gall Bladder,
    Lymphatic System, Liver (left - all points and right 1 point)

    >12 Year Program:

    Billiary Cirrhosis
    Appendicitis Necroticans (cleared most points)
    Calculi Bil
    Chelidonium
    Variolinum
    Lyme
    Sinusitis
    Hepar  ( hoping liver support is ok at this point?)

    Footplates:

    Thalmus
    Injeel chol
    Adenoma Gallenblase
    Aesculus
    Atropinum
    Berberis
    Spacupreel
    Gelsemium

    Also, found out he had acupuncture in the morning.!  He will not do it on
    the same day again.

    Question:  Does this seem to be on the right track?

    Thanks for your help!

    All Symptoms you mention are still all caused by obstruction of the Bile
    Flow. Good that it subsides a little... lighter Urine, means less Bilirubin
    in the Urine.

    The reason I mentioned Chelidionium is that its three components are all
    very useful in this condition. This support helps with regulation of Bile
    and is both good for Liver and Gallbladder. 

    Ingredients of Chelidionium:
    Chelidonium is good for all Liver and Gallbladder conditions.
    Fell Tauri (Ox Bile) will help with the Bile Flow and Gallstones. 
    Belladonna will support in Inflammatory/Infectious conditions.

    In case of Gallstones the treatment will be more effective if you also use
    Calculi Renalis.

    I wouldn't have chosen Sinisitis, Gelsemium (why?) or Lyme in this case,
    but would have focussed even more on the Gallbladder (Liver indirectly). 
    Since a more acute situation has appeared, I would have also used
    Cholecystitis. 
    Yellow Fever could have been useful because of Similarity in Symptoms. 
   
    And more Kidney support..... Solidago..

    Great information.  Thank you. 

    I did test Calculi Renalis and Cholecystitis, but they didn't clear
    points.  Perhaps should use anyway?

    I used Sinusitis to clear the Sinus point on Lymphatic and he had some
    congestion and head pressure.  Do you think it would have been  better to
    ignore this and just focus on Gallbladder?

    Also, no drops on Kidney Meridian, but I see why I should add support
    anyway.  Thanks.  Will see again next week.

    Yes this is what I would do. Focus on the Gallbladder and ignore the lesser
    problem of the Sinuses. Giving the body an impuls to heal the Sinuses while
    the Gallbladder and Liver are struggling is distracting. 

    Calculi Renalis, although you don't measure it, assists the process of
    dissolving Gallstones when used together with Calculi Billiaris (which you
    did measure...). 

    Cholecystitis I would use since there's definitely an acute flaring up of
    an Inflammation, shown by his feverish symptoms. It is likely that because
    the Cause of this Inflammation is Gallstones blocking Bile Ducts, the
    Nosode Calculi Billiaris resolves the imbalance energetically. 
    It might be that because the Cause (Gallstones) is already addressed with
    Calculi Billiaris, the Acute Inflammation is not measurable even though it
    is there.

    Anyway, I would focus on the Symptoms along with the Measurements and these
    give a good indication for Cholecystitis.

Combining Biontology with Acupuncture / Herbal Treatment

Candace Hsiao Young
January 2015 edited February 2015 in General Questions Flag
Questions:

1. Is ok if someone that has been treated regularly with the light visits an
acupuncturist and takes herbs according to that healing method?

2. How soon does a practitioner have to wait before treating with light again?

3. Are there any scenarios where the two forms of treatment be used together in
a beneficial way?

    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    February 2015 edited February 2015 Flag
    Answers:

    1. As long as you choose one modality OR the other this is ok. So if you
    decided to stop the Biontology treatments for any reason, and now the
    client wants to see an traditional Chinese doctor, there is no problem with
    that. There would, however, not be any reason for this if the Biontology
    treatment has worked.

    2. Since acupuncture and herbs bring in their own information into the body
    that can block an accurate assessment I would wait a day or three. Another
    reason to wait a couple of days after the last acupuncture session is
    because you really want to be gentle to the body and not overburden it with
    too many impulses.

    3. No. Biontology is quite complete in itself. At the end of a session the
    energetic body will be at a state of balance that you do not want to see
    disturbed again (this can only be counterproductive).
    Chinese medicine has it's own approach to working with the body and if you
    want to go into that direction it is also advised to not do anything else.
    Modalities, especially if they work on the energetic body, should not be
    mixed.
    The tendency to overdo it is a big problem. So many people are combining
    many modalities at the same time, and are actually hurting their bodies
    that way (or in the best case scenario they are just blocking possible
    progress).

    Thank you both. I agree that many are hard to convince, especially when a
    modality is new to them. It's especially hard to get people to empty their
    heads and let go of previously taught or ingested information. 

    Hopefully, more people will hear good things about biontology.

Multiple Chemical Sensitivity - Environmental Illness

slevarekslevarek
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Interesting Cases Flag
I am seeing more and more clients with the following symptoms...

Client:
Women who got really sick after 9/11. Her building was nearby, and issues began
after that time.

Symptoms:
Lung issues
EMF intolerance (biggest issue!)
Sleep Disorders,
Obsessive Compulsive Disorders,
Allergies to everything, mold, chemicals…
The list goes on...

Medical Diagnosis:
Multiple Chemical Sensitivity / Environmental Illness
Crohns,
Colitis,
Lymes, 
"Methylation Cycle" dysfunction (= if the methylation cycle doesn't work, the
immune system malfunctions, and the detoxification system malfunctions)

History:
Moved to a community in the desert (Arizona), as so many individuals do when
they get to this point. Here they do not have as many pollutants affecting
them.

Treatment:
I continually reinforced her Aura, and kept her out of Spin Inversion
For the treatment to have an effect we understood she should stay out of Spin
inversion, and she was consciously working on herself.

Results after 6 Sessions:
All drops gone, except for some Skin points. The Skin remains an issue.
EMF sensitivity subsided for the first time in over 8 years (can now enter
buildings, drive past telephone wires.. etc)
Mental outlook has changed dramatically
She is leaving this community of people who all suffer from "MCS" / "EI" as
they call it.

Any feedback is welcome..

    The effect of 9/11 on her health has probably been twofold… 

    1.  chemical exposure due to the WTC being on fire => loss of physical
    safety => immune dysfunction => ineffective defence against toxins,
    infections, EMF etc.

    This needs to be treated like we always do.. step 1 Hormone System…etc.
    But at one point you might have needed Asbestos, Dioxin, Formaldehyde,
    Arsenic (Mezereum), Heavy Metals, maybe Kerosine if you have a remedy for
    this.. ?

    2. personal and collective shock => loss of feeling of safety => weakening
    of the Aura => boundary issues and lack of embodiment
   
    The normal treatment will usually restore the physical and energetic
    integrity, but it is likely that she has arranged her whole behaviour
    around the feeling of unsafety. Behaviour is much harder to change than
    energetic integrity, and at the same time it will interfere with positive
    change.
   
    In other words, when the Aura is restored, but she continues to act
    defensive, evasive, fearful, escapistic etc. => the Aura will automatically
    become weakened again
    So this might need conscious work of making contact with the body and
    realising that it is safe again.

    You probably worked on both aspects.
    It would be great to hear more specific details!

Q&A - Marijuana

Many new marijuana medicinals are entering the marketplace in Washington State
where I live (ie. creams, CBD pills, etc.). These are being used by people for
a wide array of reasons. 

Questions:
1. What is it in marijuana that paralyzes the Pituitary? 
2. The products have varying concentrations of THC, from none to a lot... does
this make a difference for their effect on the Pituitary?

    I'm finding measuring people who are smoking marijuana very time consuming
    and difficult indeed. The sounds are all over the place either none at all
    or odd low sounds on the nervous system. What's especially difficult is
    when a client doesn't tell me and I spend time trying to discern if I
    should treat for spin or whiplash or endomorph issues???

    After I've struggled through for a good 20 minutes, they say, "oh yeah, I
    smoked a bunch of pot last night. Sorry." 

    I'm thinking perhaps I need to write something on my waiver that clients
    need to choose between smoking pot or getting treated? No one I treat
    actually has a prescription for medical marijuana, but they all say they
    are buying medical marijuana from someone who does have a script.

    Answers:
    1. Marihuana does not paralyse the Pituitary. It creates a lot of stress
    for the Pituitary and the gland gives instructions to the Nerves to produce
    Endorphins.
    If there are Endorphins the Pituitary does not receive messages and
    therefore does not take any actions. In this way you could consider it as
    paralysis, but it is not really. 
   
    2. Because it is the THC that causes the "high", it is probable that this
    is the substance that affects the Pituitary and Endorphin production. But
    this is not known. 

    I have no idea if various kinds of products cause different stress levels
    in the Pituitary gland and if the reactions are different, Someone needs to
    do extensive research in order to make any form of statements.

    In case of Marihuana use before a treatment, Viscum is sufficient in

    assessment.

    Questions:
    1. Using Viscum before treatment would lift the mask up until the next time
    the person smokes Marijuana -correct?  

    2. Is there any point in treating someone who is unwilling to give up using
    Marijuana? 
  •

    January 2014 Flag
    Answers:
    1. Correct.

    2. Not if you want to go beyond Symptom Treatment, but sometimes you can
    get to the reason as to why someone choses this addiction, and thus giving
    up Marijuana might become easier.

    But there needs to be a willingness to do so of course…

    Many people however are very happy with temporary Symptom relief. It is
    also a choice of what kind of therapist you want to be. But I would be very
    honest in explaining what Marijuana does and that using it blocks the
    Pituitary and hence the possibility to completely Self-Heal.

    From my personal 40 year history with Lyme, your clients infection is no
    longer in his body, but also in his brain affecting the Autonomic Nervous
    System etc.

    Here's a piece from the forum on Lyme found in the psychology area. LINK
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    June 2014 edited June 2014 Flag
    Lyme Disease is a diagnose, and as with all other diseases every case is
    different from the next, but also Lyme gets to be misdiagnosed too… 

    To be completely objective you need to start your assessment similar to all
    other clients. Try to find the full complex of complaints, the history
    (when did symptoms start and how did it evolve), the medical procedures
    that your client underwent, drugs that were/are used, etc. The only thing
    we are not interested in are the actual diagnoses.. they easily create
    projections and distractions. 
    You can keep the diagnoses in the back of your head, but should not focus
    on them. The focus should be on the Meridians in combination with the
    symptoms! First clear the Hormone System…. etc. (see Protocol)

    There are however observed similarities to people diagnosed with Lyme or
    with people who don't have Lyme but similar symptom complexes. It seems
    that an extremely large percentage of clients with Lyme have a history of
    trauma and (physical or psychological) abuse in the past.

    This is interesting and can be useful to know, but also it should not
    distract from using the regular treatment procedure of balancing the Organ
    Systems (meridians) in the right/logical order. 

    I personally found in clients who told me they had Lyme:
    Gallbladder and Adrenals are always an issue.
    Lyme clients are full of chronic infections/inflammations everywhere… 
    I found that many practitioners tend to overlook the importance of the Jaw,
    which is often severely affected in these clients.

    There are too many different causative factors found to be able to make a
    nice "Lyme specific" list. Maybe if you give all information including
    measurements in a case-presentation we can help you better with this
    client.
   
    Please don't fall for "Lyme protocols" => there are none! Biontology works
    differently…
   
    Another thing never to do is tell people they have Lyme disease when you
    measure the Lyme nosode. The Chiren does not diagnose, it only tells you
    whether there is resonance with the remedy. Just like you usually don't
    have atropinum in your system when you measure for the remedy Atropinum,
    measuring a positive for Lyme does not necessarily mean someone has the
    Lyme spirochete.

    Karolina - your comment about a jaw infection is so true in my limited
    experience so far. My son had to come home from camp last summer to have
    his wisdom teeth removed.I treated him and he seemed to be balanced when he
    returned, but a couple of weeks later, I had to treat his kidneys and jaw
    again, but this time "Lyme" showed up. I put in the nosode and didn't pay
    too much attention, despite the fact that his job was outdoors surrounded
    by deer! Everything cleared up nicely. 

    My latest client presented herself to me with many symptoms which
    originated with her Gallbladder, Adrenals and Jaw issues (an old wisdom
    tooth cavity acting up and a file left IN her jaw by a dentist!). Tonight
    she emailed me and told me that she finally received a diagnosis from a
    test done before I first treated her and sure enough it said that she had
    Lyme's. 
    As usual, the diagnosis is often more harmful than the fact - because the
    fact is debatable. I am advising her to try and not concern herself with
    labels, take one step at a time and I will treat the terrain.  :)  Jennifer

Protocol Question

SVitale
June 2014 edited June 2014 in Biontology Insights Flag
1. When finished with the hand treatment and we re measure the points, we do
this without the remedies? 

2. When tonsilitis comes up do we also add appendix as well?

3. There does not seem to be a remedy for gasoline, correct? 

4. If I need to make a gasoline remedy, do I put this in the cup as a
Neutralization treatment?  And is this done by putting the gas in the cup and
choosing Neutralization while client hold the hand rods....?

    1. Yes, always remeasure without the remedies to see what points have
    changed

    2. Not necessarily, only when you measure it somewhere

    3. No there's no remedy in the Chiren for gasoline, but when the
    self-regulating and detoxifying abilities of the body have been corrected
    most toxins will leave the body automatically. 

    4. Neutralising directly is dangerous as has been discussed in class
    (remember the tick story?). There's no filter in the neutralisation
    program, which means that information can be brought into the body, that
    the body doesn't have a need for. 
    In therapy only the "Standard Programs", the "Whiplash" program, the "Spin
    Inversion" program, and the "Dyslexia" program are to be used.

    Also, if you would hold both rods while running the Neutralization program
    you would neutralise your own information, since in this program the
    information that enters the Chiren via the INPUT port will leave via the
    EXIT port inverted.

    Questions:
    1. What is the Neutralization then for?  
    I thought it reversed the frequency of the item therefore if you used a
    tick in a 1/tick frequency you would then deflect the tick.  
    2. Is the neutralization an inverse signal?  
    3. If not then how is it used?  
    4. Can one desensitize someone with the Chiren as in a 'gasoline' toxicity,
    i.e. a person is overexposed to the gas fumes.?  
   
    I guess I'm confused about the remedy vs the inverse of it.

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    The neutralisation is used for inverting information (frequencies are
    irrelevant in Biontology), but to use it safely you should make a remedy of
    the inverted substance first so you can use it in the regular programs. 

    The high potencies of homeopathic nosodes also act as inverted information,
    and these are also used in the regular programs. They have a neutralising/
    detoxifying effect.

    For example: 
    When you have someone with gasoline toxicity and you want to specifically
    address this (usually this is not necessary if you correct the body's
    detoxification pathways, as then the body will start to detox it
    automatically!), you could do two things: 
    1. find a high potency homeopathic remedy of the substance (gasoline)
    2. make a remedy with the neutralisation program *

    * Procedure for making a remedy with the neutralisation program:
    1. put a glass vile with salty water or alcohol/water solution on the light
    emitting footplate
    2. put a glass vile with the substance (gasoline) either on the other
    footplate or in the cup
    3. run the neutralisation program
    4. the inverted information is now loaded in the vile with salty water
    5 use the loaded vile in a regular program (I would measure first to see
    where it actually disturbs the body)
   
    Alternatively you can also use one of your Chiren cards to make the
    inverted remedy, but this is more expensive and a bit of a waste if you
    need a substance only for one person.
   
    NOTE: Neutralizing a substance helps the body to release gasoline build up
    in the body (detoxification). It does not prevent build up of toxins in the
    future. The only way to assist the body in dealing better with exposure to
    all kinds of toxins is to balance the whole system. It is always best to
    find a way to limit exposure to toxins.

    Here is the link toward the discussion about how neutralising a tick caused
    Sylvia's dog to attract ticks. 

    LINK

    After inquiring we found that there were more stories about adverse effects
    when using the Neutralisation program directly. Because of this we now only
    use this program with an extra step -creating the remedy- in between. This
    way there is always the Biophoton filter that only allows the information
    that is helpful and does not disturb anything into the body.

    Informational medicine works differently from chemical medicine. Often
    chemical drugs are altered in the body… So what you measure might not be
    the substance that causes the "desired" reaction in the body. This makes
    things somewhat complicated…

    What you measure is what the information of that drug does for the body. So
    if it measures positive, you can make an informational remedy out of it.
    What the meds would do when taken physically might be something completely
    different.

    So you can never measure whether a drug itself is beneficial to take
    physically!

    The reality in practice is that there is no medication that will measures
    positive all over.

    I have read the above link on the attempt of neutralization ticks for a
    dog. 

    We have a lot of Poison Ivy here and it would be useful if I could make a
    remedy/nosode for it to treat the skin rash that results or treat if it
    gets into a person's system.  
   
    So I tried. Here was my procedure:
    * Pull some Poison Ivy leaves in a few pieces to expose more of the oil
    * Put the pieces in the cup 
    * Chip card - chip down - on the footplate with the light
    * Run neutralisation
    * Loaded the card into the Chiren

    I treated a rash of poison ivy by putting the light rods on either side of
    the rash and ran a 2-7  => no change Then I gave her a standard hand
    treatment (2-7 yrs program) => rash was getting irritated and more itchy so
    we stopped.

    Questions:
    1. Why did this procedure not work?  
    2. Should I have pulverized the poison ivy? 
    3. Did I need to soak the poison ivy in a salt/alcohol water mix to get the
    energy?  
    4. I would appreciate any help since we would really like to create this
    remedy
    5. What is the difference between a remedy and a nosode?

    Sharon:
    Your procedure of creating a Neutralizing Remedy is correct. That is if you
    first attached a name to the Chip card, but I think you did this because
    there is no way you could have loaded the remedy in the Chiren without
    doing this first.

    Answers:
    1. Of course I can not be sure why it did not work, but it is likely that
    the information of the leaves was not transmitted well enough into the
    Chiren to be effective. Loading dry substances is usually not that
    effective.
    2. Pulverization for sure would have brought out the information better.
    3. Yes, diluting is a must, since fluids absorb and radiate information
    best
    4. Buying a dilute homeopathic remedy in potencies D12, D30, D200 (12X,
    30X, 200X) for sure will have a deeper action than just the inverted
    information. Rhus Toxicodendron = Poison Ivy
    5. Remedy => either the direct or inverted information of a substance
       Nosode => potentized and diluted homeopathic remedy made from disease
    causing elements like bacteria or of the disease itself. Rhus Toxicodendron
    is not a nosode

    But anyway you did bring up something I forgot.  when I made the card, I
    forgot to attach a name to it so after I made the card, I then went back
    and put a name on and then did the neutralization again on the same card in
    case something got erased.  So maybe I messed up the card by doing the
    neutralization first, then the name and then the neutralization again. 

    Also, I don't understand your point 3.  Are you saying that I MUST put the
    poison ivy (pulverized) into at salt or alcohol water mix first, then put
    that solution into the spin cup and run the neutralization program with a
    card on the lighted foot plate?  For I did not do that the first time.  

    I understand that you are saying buying a dilute homeopathic remedy is
    best, but I am having fun try to make this remedy myself and want to try
    again.

    "...when I made the card, I forgot to attach a name to it so after I made
    the card, I then went back and put a name on…"

    This certainly can be an issue in proper transference of the the remedy
    onto the card. There always should be a name on the card first so the
    information can be attached to it. 
   
    " Are you saying that I MUST put the poison ivy (pulverized) into at salt
    or alcohol water mix first, then put that solution into the spin cup and
    run the neutralization program with a card on the lighted foot plate? "

    Yes, to create a remedy the information of the dry substance needs to be
    put in (salty)water or alcohol so it can absorb and emit it. For some
    reason information in fluid is transferred better into the Chiren.

    " I am having fun try to make this remedy myself and want to try again "

    Continue please…!!! I don't want to spoil your fun ;-) 

    Hope it will work better with the above advise.

Dental Work on Gallbladder Point

    Two of my teeth on the Galbladder point did not come down as child.
    So I still have my baby teeth at 26 year age. 
    The dentist opened up the dental tissue and put in steel vaiers that should
    draw my new teeth out over a longer time. But I got so bad from this that
    they had to end it. 

    So now I have one new tooth that is almost drawn out, but in the middle of
    my gum. And the other new tooth they did not get as far out, just
    underneeth the skin and in the middle of the mouth. 

    They were going to pull the teeth out to the sides later, when they had
    come all the way down. But I had to end it before I got there. 

    Question: can this make it differcult for my Gallbladder to heal? That my
    baby tooth are still there and the ones that should have come down are on
    the wrong place.

    The teeth have an enormous influence on the functioning of organs, so that
    could be.
    Normally you can check which organs should be affected, by termining which
    tooth is the problem.
    But in your case when several of the teeth arein the wrong spots, I would
    have to make an exact analysis what tooth is going where. But i am very
    much asking myself why this has happened.

    The location where my baby teeth is still there, and the new ones did not
    come down on theire own= BOTH TEETH IS CONNECTED TO THE GALBLADDER ON THE
    MAP. 

    The teeth that did not come down on their own are drawn down to where they
    are now by the dentist work. Not by free will.

    The teeth did not want to come down at all. And they are not on the right
    place, because the dentist had to stop the work because i got so ill. 

    The dentist where going to remove my babyteeth, when he had drawn down the
    new grown up teeth beside them. So i did not have to go without 2 teeth for
    a longer period.

    All my other teeth are normal.

    Maby you have a chance to have a look at it in Rotterdam, if you have the
    time. If this does not tell you what you need to know,
    Thank you.

    First things first… in all situations you first need to get the body to
    work again. The worms are secondary and won't go away until you have
    treated the underlying problem. The Terrain was welcoming to them.

    You first need to work on the Hormone System, Circulation, Yang Organs and
    Kidneys before you can address the specific problem with the Worms. They
    also might go away by themselves when everything else is corrected and the
    immune function works properly again.

    Comments about the case:
    * Almost all points drop in both treatments, but the question is whether
    they drop sharply or slowly.
    Sharp drops indicate a Spin Inversion or a Loss of Aura (Ozaliet).

    * In the first and second session almost the many and same points drop,
    which means that there was little reaction of the body.

    * A YIN organ (Heart) was treated before the YANG organs were functioning
    again. 
    This is not according to the Protocol.

    * A Heavy Metal (Mercury) was used, at this stage when excretion is not
    functioning. 
    This is not a good idea.

    * Circulation was treated with Calcification remedies before the
    Parathyroid was in order.
    This is useless at this stage.

    * The second session the Kidney is showing a drop while it was OK in the
    first session.
    This indicates that some of the Toxins that you treated with were released
    after the first session got stuck in the Kidneys. It also means that the
    detox after the first session was too heavy and the body could not do it.
   
    * There are three reasons for Chronic Fatigue, all confirmed by your
    measurements.
    a. She gets up stiff => indication for Adrenal exhaustion.
    b. Cyst in her Liver => treat Circulation
    c. She has severe Intestinal problems => the Intestinal Flora is lacking
    and affecting other parts of the body

    * Try to focus:
    1. Get the Hormonal System right + support the Kidneys => make sure that
    they work 100%.
    2. Then try to get the Intestines right.
    In case of Appendicitis the Bacteria can be everywhere in the body. Try the
    Intestinal Bacteria on the rest of the body. 
    3. Do not overdo it. Her body clearly does not have the energy to detox
    properly and she must change her lifestyle. If she continues to exhaust her
    body, she will not recover. 
   
    * When there are worms, there is usually an underlying problem of TB.

    Hi Johan,

    I treated my client as you advised, 4 more times working first on the body
    to work again. Not worrying about the worms. Telling her you though the
    worms might be cysts.

    After the 3 treatments she went back to her doctors in the Tropic centre of
    AMC Hospital Amsterdam and they were still convinced of the presence of
    worms (eggs) and advised her pills against the worm and perhaps later
    surgery.

    The next day she came to me for treatment and gave me the pills for
    measurement. I measured the pills were really bad for her, because almost
    all points were dropping.

    The next day a new doctor called her (an old parisite expert) and told her
    they made a mistake and the worm was not a worm but …. surprise surprise
    ….. turned out to be cysts. She had to stop with the pills immediately.

    So than she went for 6 weeks to Ecuador, relaxing, having fun and being
    happy with her husband. Back in Holland we had again a session. Still some
    drops, but not much.

    The day after that she went back to the hospital, this time to have a
    drainage to get rid of the cysts. But first the echo... They were totally
    surprised not seeing even one little cyst.

    I know I have still a lot to learn, but the happy face of this client makes
    me eager to learn more and more.

    Txs Johan for your help and biontology !

Kangen Water and Kidney Disease

Maggie LesniewskiMaggie Lesniewski
April 2015 edited April 2015 in Other Therapies & Instruments Flag
I was given a Kangen machine in December that changes pH of water and cleanses
it from any harmful chemicals.

Client:
My question concerns my daughter, who has Kidney disease

Symptoms:
Water retention

Medication:
She is off of heavy medication since December => she was doing much better
without those meds and her swelling wasn't as bad
She was still taking diuretics and blood pressure medication, but over a month
ago I decided to stop medication completely because she responded very well to
Biontology sessions

Use of Kangen Water:
When we received the machine, we started to give her Kangen Water (pH 8.5)
I found out that kangen water shouldn't be drank with medication, but we always
gave her clean water (pH 7) to chase medication and then Kangen Water (pH 8.5)
any other time.

Effects of using Kangen Water:
She began to swell up again => we stopped giving her Kangen Water => swelling
improved
Over a week ago started to give her Kangen Water again (pH 8.5 - never higher
than that) => she started to swell up a lot again.

Effects of Biontology sessions:
She reacted really well to treatments.
After one session right before we went away for a week, she lost almost all her
swelling within about 10-15h after the treatment and kept on loosing more for
about 5 days. She was in amazing condition - the best since diagnosis.
Then the swelling slowly started to come back likely because she picked up some
sort of bacteria or virus or food poisoning ... 3 days later when we came back
she got another treatment but this got disturbed because she went into Spin
Inversion...which makes me worry about our home...not sure if there is
something here that keeps having a negative effect on our systems because we
both go into Spin Inversion quite a lot. We spend most of the time at home
since she doesn't go to school. We don't have spring mattresses or metal
bedframes.

Question
There might be few other things apart from the Kangen Water that could have
made her retain more water, but is it possible that there is a negative
interaction between Biontology sessions, drinking Kangen Water (pH 8.5-9.5),
and Kidney diseases?

    1. I had two clients were repeated exposure to Platinum water filters
    seemed to be a factor in having resonance with Platinum. I still do not
    know if it was pure energetical or physical exposure but resonance was
    present. They made choice to stay away from that water. You always can
    try but pay attention to that moment.

    2. Concerning water ph level, my understanding is that the body has to
    bring water down to appropriate PH depending were the water goes during
    digestive process. So, giving high ph water might not make sense if body
    has to work extra hard to bring it down to level 2.

    Thank you Yelyena. It is true that water filters can cause Platinum
    problems and also that the body will regulate whatever pH level change is
    caused by food or drink... 

    Maggie, I do wonder how exhausting this week long trip has been for your
    daughter. The Adrenals and Kidneys are intimately related. Sensitivity to
    Spin Inversion will also increase when one has no energy. 

    When there are big improvements at one point, and then there is a falling
    back, most likely it is not a constant cause (like bed spirals) that is in
    the way. You will need to look at the specific situation right before the
    health declined again. So from your description the Kangen Water is
    definitely not good, but also there may be a need for constancy and more
    REST in order for your daughter's body to self-heal.

    I had a Kangen system for a few years and was an avid fan until I realized
    that drinking alkaline water might raise the pH of stomach acid to the
    point of not killing food poisons. We know in Biontology that this can lead
    to a compromised appendix, which can cause bacteria to travel outside of
    the colon and other systems of the body. I prefer to eat alkalizing foods,
    rather than drink artificially "alkalized" water.

    I agree, the use of alkaline water is a problem in that it will reduce the
    pH of the stomach acid.  People take these things to extreme and want to
    alkalize the system unnaturally.  One could also make the argument that the
    alkalinity slowed the circulation down, leading to edema.

    Thank you all for this valuable information!

    More about my daughter's situation
    Since mid December she a was in a steady condition - not the best but at
    least there was nothing major happening that could have ended up with a
    hospitalization. She was supposed to receive a treatment right before the
    trip and then right after the trip. But she started feeling really sick on
    Monday so her biontologist treated her that evening but she wasn't getting
    much better and most points were dropping on next day so she got another
    treatment on Wednesday night. We flew out on Thursday morning. She started
    getting better immediately. I did spin inversion on her right after the
    flight. Friday morning she looked like her old self - she lost most of the
    water without taking any diuretics. We were never able to achieve such an
    improvement in such a short time. During the trip we were using stroller
    all the time so she wouldn't waste too much energy on walking. We went to
    Disney so there was a lot of excitement for her and she was very happy. I
    would assume that had nothing but good effect on her. 
    I think there might be some disturbances in our house and even in New York
    that are affecting her to the point that the treatments are not as
    effective as they should be or it's just a coincident that as soon as we
    left NY she improved so much. 
    I will be taking her out of the city for about 1.5 week right after she
    receives treatment. Then I will be bring her back just for treatments.
    Maybe that will give us some answers. 

    Thank you again for all the advice. 

    Warm regards

    Maggie

    With this extra information, for sure I would suspect a problem in your
    living situation. 
    Maybe you can find someone to measure your house through for disturbances?
   
    I cannot assess how exhausting the trip has been for your daughter as I was
    not there. But in general one cannot assume that excitement is always good.
    Balanced enjoyment and fun are healthy, but as far as excitement is
    concerned... don't forget that this falls under the pathological emotions.
    It is what in the five element system is meant by "joy". One can definitely
    have too much of a good thing and thus hurt the body.

    Most Kangen water devices have titanium in them. Some people get increased
    inflammation from titanium metal exposure. If you have a certified Building
    Biologist near you they can do measurements  (Liz Menkes at EMFhealthy may
    be able to give you a referral) OR you can go to emfinfo or emfcenter and
    rent equipment to do measurements yourself. You can also search your
    address at the antenna search website to find out how many cell towers/
    antennas are within 1-4 miles. (The latter is free)

    Thank you Toril, you are right about the Titanium. This metal is present in
    many reversed osmosis water purifiers. The matter of water purification,
    just like EMF protection is a constant struggle. Unfortunately we are
    living in a much polluted world. But there are better ways than others to
    deal with it... Some "solutions" are worse than the problem itself.

    The water that comes from the tap in South Africa is also not that great...
    Chickey treatment does help, but when we have more time, Johan and I will
    try to create a "flow system" with shaped basins that flow from a higher
    level to a lower level. He has seen in a laboratory setting that this can
    actually remove the chemicals.

    The research was done at an agricultural college in Nijmegen (the
    Netherlands). 
    It should be available somewhere, but this was so long ago (about 25 years)
    that I cannot tell where you can find it. At the time studies like this
    were not digitalised or shared through the internet like nowadays... I
    owned a copy of it, but I have moved so many times in my life that I must
    have lost it somewhere. 

    Once I have time again to focus on research I will experiment with it in my
    own garden. But anyone can try it. You need 12 cascades in heart shaped
    form. The water needs to exit the shape in the point where you create an
    opening.

    Thank you again .. all this information is very helpful.

    I did the research about antennas and towers. I am assuming towers are more
    harmful than antennas, yes?

    There is 82 towers within a 3 mile radius from our apartment and over 500
    antennas. I have an option of staying with my mom who lives in
    Pennsylvania. There is 10 towers and 132 antennas also within a 3 mile
    radius from her house. Most likely this is when she will be spending
    summer. 
   
    There is another issue that might be greatly affect treatments - stress. We
    are going through extremely tough time in my family. Dealing with my father
    who is a heavy alcoholic. No matter what I do I cannot protect her from
    knowing everything. It's just impossible. Last time we went there for over
    a week to see if not being in New York would improve effectiveness of
    treatment, we ended up in a very stressful situation. Also me being
    extremely stressed out and being with her 24/7 affects her greatly even if
    I try to hide my worries and stress. I am filled with stress, anger,
    frustration and sadness which is probably being projected on her.
   
    My question is: Is it possible that she got so much better right after we
    left on our vacation because within hours we all (Olivia, my husband and I)
    became worry free, relaxed, excited and very happy? Can all these positive
    feelings have such a huge effect on health improvement (along with
    treatments)?

    I believe children sense whatever their parents are feeling. She may be
    internalizing her feelings. I have to be careful, with my paranoia about
    EMR, how I project feelings as my son is a sponge, too. Still, it is good
    to know what environmental stressors may be adding to the overall stress
    load.

    Yes I have been treated as swell. But the amount of stress I have been
    dealing with for past year and not being able to deal with these emotion
    and just being strong and though for my daughter is having very bad
    consequences now. 

    I think that right now the best would be to find away to move away from all
    this negativity and create relaxed and fun situation until she makes a
    significant improvement. Then we can slowly get back to "normal" life.

Copy Pasting a Message without Formatting

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
February 2013 edited February 2013 in Forum Tools Flag
I've noticed that messages are often written in a different computer program,
outside this forum and then pasted here. If it is not refused (Vanilla will
give the message "too many characters"), then there's another problem that it
will look chaotic because the formatting is not completely recognised and it
will be copied differently.

To prevent this you can paste your message in the window that appears if you
choose the third symbol on the right (left from the printer-symbol) above this
box. This way you won't copy your lay-out which makes the text appear strange.

    Karolina: I don't see your box, or the printer symbol. Here is another
    workaround:

    For those with a PC: Left click on the start menu and in the box at the
    bottom type "notepad" and press enter. When notepad opens, paste the
    message that you copied from Microsoft Word or any other program. This will
    strip it of all formatting. Then paste it into the forum comment box.

    I've been copying some of the responses on the forum into MS Word so I can
    review them later. Recently it's started bringing over formatting from the
    forum which places the messages into a blue box in MS Word. The workaround
    that I described above will also work for this issue.

    The window that you type messages in has a menu bar with formatting tools

    symbol is a clipboard with a note with letter T. This is the one you have
    to choose.

Homeopathic Potencies

janjan
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Biontology Insights Flag
Please forgive the basic nature of this question as I have no background in
homeopathy and am trying to learn from the internet and here and the classes.

I have heard some of the homeopathic remedies we have have all potencies and
the body chooses the correct one, then I have heard some of our remedies are
low potencies and then others ...  high potencies. How do I know if it is a all
potency, high potency or a low potency if I choose one.  Like for instance
Causticum, or many others. 

As I am working with a homeopath as a client and I am telling him this is
taking the guesswork out of his dosing himself on symptoms  only, and that the
body will choose the appropriate dose of what I give him, when he asks what
potency a certain one is knowing we have all, low and high, what would I say,
other than I am not sure.

    If you use the search tool you will find this for example:

    " It is interesting to hear the nosodes are made in D12 D30 and D200
    potencies. 
    I am wondering about using the cup to send in remedies. First of all what
    does the cup do? My understanding of it is it takes in the energy of whats
    in the cup (blood pharmaceuticals) and amplifies the coherent light and
    inverts the non coherent light. Can we put pus from a clients infection or
    from a cyst boil in the cup and run a program to remind the body it has
    something to deal with. If we did that would it neutralize the the for pus
    in the body, or does it tell the body to expel the pus or both? Do you
    think it would be more effective to make a homeopathic solution of the pus
    and put it in the cup to remind the body to deal with the pus. Would we be
    more certain of its effectiveness if we made a solution of D12 D30 and
    D200? I also wonder about the spring in the cup, is that just for running a
    spin inversion program or is it useful in other cases? Johnty "

Reaction to treatment

rmargilrmargil
January 2014 edited January 2014 in About This Forum Flag
A 74 years of age female diagnosed with Parkinson's Dx came in today for her
4th Biophoton Therapy Session. I asked her how she was doing prior to beginning
the session and she reported generally she has more energy and that she was
sitting and standing up straighter. (She has had one chiropractic treatment and
it was on a separate day from a biophoton session. 

HER REACTION:
She had a VERY strong reaction 3-4 minutes into the standard program 9 minute ,
52 seconds.  Shortly after the initial onset of the light treatment she noticed
she was getting  extremely dizzy feeling drained and weak. She then proceeded
to either faint or have some form of seizure which resulted in her inability to
speak and labored almost choking breathing all with her eyes open and her
losing consciousness. Her hands were gripped in a fist, she had wet, sweaty
hands. I took the rods out of her hands. She regained consciousness in about 5
minutes. This was followed by vomiting several times over a period of 1 1/2
hours with initially mostly clear liquid coming up then yellow then green.
 Next, she said she had to go to the bathroom for a bowel movement. She
reported after she regained consciousness that she had a history of fainting
but not for several years. She was very tired, and wanted to sleep. She hadn't
eaten in 3 hours. She had taken a Parkinson's med of Carbidopa/levadopa 1 hour
prior to the appointment. She says it normally makes her tired and not feel
great for 1 hour before she takes the med but she felt fine with it today.
She was convinced the biophoton therapy was hitting something deep and having a
powerful effect. She said she was shaking on the inside-which is where she says
she shakes. I took her blood pressure and it was 112/60. She reported her blood
pressure is normally low.  
Point Drops:
Left Hand: 
Heart: 2nd proximal 
Hormonal: Pituitary, Parathyroid, Thymus
Large Intestine:
Proximal 2 points

Right Hand:
Hormonal System: 2nd,3rd, 4th, 5th proximal point
Circulation: all points drop
Large Intestine: all points drop

Remedies: Anterior Lope of Pituitary for Pituitary pt.
                Chronic tonsillitis for Parathyroid
                Canibus Sativa for Thyroid   ( patient mentioned today she had
smoked Pot when she was younger)
                Strep Hemolytica for Hear POint
                Diptherie for all hormonal points on right hand
                Chronic appendicitis for appendicitis point
                Nickel for remainder of large intestine points right hand
                Barijodeel for all Circulation points

I would certainly appreciate any feedback on this.

    Ok, I've edited the case again. Just this one time as an example for
    everyone to see how it can be done and also because it needs a response
    quickly.

    Client:
    74 years of age female diagnosed with Parkinson's Dx came in today for her
    4th Biophoton Therapy Session.

    Response to previous sessions:
    Generally more energy
    Sitting and standing up straighter (1 chiropractic session separate from
    biophoton sessions)

    Measurement:
    Heart (L) - 1 point (2nd proximal) - Streptococcus Heamolyticus
    Pituitary - Anterior Lope of Pituitary
    Parathyroid - Chronic Tonsillitis
    Thymus
    Large Intestine (L) - 2 points (proximal)

    Thyroid - Cannabus Sativa (smoked Pot when younger)
    Thymus - Diphterie
    Insulin low - Diphterie
    Triple Warmer (R) - 5th point - Diphterie
    Circulation (R) - all points drop - Barijodeel
    Large Intestine (R) - all points drop - Chronic Appendicitis, Nickel

    Response:
    VERY strong reaction 3-4 minutes into the standard program 9 minute , 52
    seconds. 
    When treatment started:
    => she was getting extremely dizzy, feeling drained and weak. 
    => then she either fainted or had some form of seizure 
    => resulted in inability to speak, labored almost choking breathing 
    => all with her eyes open and her losing consciousness 
    => hands were wet, sweaty and gripped in a fist
   
    My response/action:
    I took the rods out of her hands. 
   
    Response after discontinuing the treatment:
    => She regained consciousness in about 5 minutes. 
    => Followed by vomiting several times over a period of 1 1/2 hours 
    => Initially mostly clear liquid coming up, then yellow then green. 
    => Next, she had a bowel movement. 
   
    Conversation afterward:
    => Mentions a history of fainting, but not for several years. 
    => Was very tired, and wanted to sleep 
    => Not eaten in 3 hours 
    => Parkinson's medication (Carbidopa/levadopa) => 1 hour prior to the
    appointment => normally this makes her tired and not feel great for 1 hour
    before she takes the medication but she felt fine with it today.
    => Convinced biophoton therapy was hitting something deep and having a

    Question:
    1. I would certainly appreciate any feedback on this.
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    February 2014 edited February 2014 Flag
    First of all I would like to emphasise, that this case has not been handled
    according to protocol, and that the response might not be a necessary
    "powerful effect". 
    I'm glad your client interpreted it this way though, and maybe the response
    was indeed unavoidable… 

    But my experience with sessions that provoke extreme "detox reactions", as
    this is often referred to, is that the treatment is usually done in the
    wrong sequence and important issues like Spin Inversion, Whiplash, Scars,
    Vaccinations are overlooked.

    My own experience I have had with seizures during a treatment is only with
    one client, and this was due to Spin Inversion.

    What I wonder about is what you have done in previous sessions, since this
    is already your 4th session.

    So when I look at your case I notice:

    * Pituitary, Parathyroid and Thyroid dropped…. You clearly measured
    Whiplash, and the Chiropractic session could have caused this. 
    Why didn't you do a Whiplash treatment? 
   
    * Remedies are used that are not standard in the Chiren. What potencies are
    they, how are they created (pellets, dilutes)? It is hard to comment about
    their effectiveness…. I have encountered so many remedies that did not do
    what they were supposed to do…
   
    * The remedy "Anterior Lope of Pituitary" you used for the Pituitary is
    clearly an Organ Preparation, these are only useful as Support for
    Regeneration of the physical organ, but not suitable to clean up the 
    Malfunction. So it is not a Causal remedy, and the master gland is
    extremely important to correct!
   
    * Barijodeel is used while the Parathyroid still drops. This is useless,
    since the Parathyroid must be right before you can use remedies like
    Barijodeel which are dealing with the results of a malfunctioning
    Parathyroid. You must always do this after the gland has been corrected.
    First function needs to be restored, then consequences.
   
    * Why did you use Nickel when the Excretion Organs are not corrected as
    yet? The excretion organs should always be right first. 
   
    * Liver and Gallbladder are not showing in your measurements yet, but
    symptoms (muscles) indicate their malfunction. So there's still a lot of
    stress and suppression on these Organs. Forcing the body to eliminate Heavy
    Metals right now is only to give more stress on these systems => Seizures
    are Gallbladder/Liver symptoms.
   
    * You use Chronic Appendicitis without using the acute form at the same
    time. This could result in acute symptoms, and you definitely don't want
    that...

    Although even severe reactions after treatment have never lead to damage,
    and there might even be some improvement after a couple of days, I want to
    urge you to follow protocol and be very aware of the natural course of
    healing of the body. Better results with less adverse reactions can be
    achieved when you take all the comments above into account.

Whiplash

suzanne
February 2013 edited February 2014 in Measurement Flag
In the protocol it is stated that when there are drops on Thyroid en
Parathyroid, it is probably a case of Whiplash. But I assume it is also
possible to have droppings on both points without having a Whiplash. 

Question:
So how can you double-check if it is really Whiplash then?

    If you have treated the Whiplash and after that the both points are still
    dropping, you can try to put in remedies for the Parathyroid or Thyroid.

    Try for:
    Parathyroid => Anti-Tetanus, Serum Ovile, Mumps, Morbilinum, Varicellen,
    (Chronic) Tonsillitis, Tonsillar Proepfe. 

    Thyroid => Strumeel, Thyroid, (Chronic) Tonsillitis, Tonsillar proepfe. 

    It's not nessecary to put all remedies but try and check.

    Ok, thanks for your reply. So in fact sometimes you're never sure wether it
    was a whiplash or not. Anyway in the case you have the same droppings on
    both points after the whiplash-treatment!

    You will be sure that there was Whiplash if the Thyroid was corrected after
    the Whiplash treatment (the Parathyroid, in a first session, will still
    drop then because of the Anti-Tetanus). 
    Sometimes you have to do the Whiplash treatment twice...

    But if the Whiplash treatment doesn't change anything you'll know it was
    not there and you can try other remedies that are indicated for the Thyroid
    and Parathyroid.

List of Contraindications

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
January 2014 edited July 2014 in Contraindications Flag
Contraindications for treatment:

a) any organ transplant, including a pig heart valve.
b) shunts(tubes) that do go to the brain & artificial veins
c) people with thrombosis, who don't use medication (blood thinners). This is
not a definite contraindication, but therapists must be very careful with this
and be familiar with anatomy and physiology of the body.
d) retina replacement of the eye. I am not aware of any negative effects in
this case, but better be safe than sorry

There is no contraindication for:

1) cadaver bone implants, although treatment better be delayed for a few months
after implant
2) implants of artificial lenses
3) hip replacements or other metal implants
4) stents (metal)
5) pacemakers
6) breast implants

    The client has cadaver tendon in one knee. He never took
    immunosuppressants.

    Can I treat him?  Can the body reject cadaver tendon but not cadaver bone?

    I would advise not to treat cadaver tendon. I have no actual experience
    with it, but the connection between the animal tendon and the body's own
    tendon can create a problem… Better safe than sorry.

    Why can cadaver bone implants be treated after a few months but a cadaver
    tendon can't? 

    Are there other cadaver implants, other than bone, that can be treated?

    What about defibulation implants?

    Barbara:  Defibrillator implants are similar to pacemakers and should be
    safe to treat.  Because they are not biological there is no risk of
    rejection.   And they are typically not hollow like a shunt which can
    become plugged if the body tries to encase it.  It would be interesting to
    know what drops you find on the heart meridian and if any of the cardiac
    remedies in the Chiren are a good match.  With that information, perhaps
    you can help this client's heart condition to improve. 

    Johan and Karolina:  To expand on my question above, if a doctor does not
    see the need to prescribe anti-rejection medication, and tells the client
    that there is no threat of rejection after 6 months or so, can those
    cadaver grafts eventually be treated?  Wouldn't normal cellular replacement
    eventually cause the graft to become fully assimilated into the hosts body?
     

    Because it would be impossible to make a list of all the body parts that
    are being transplanted these days, we need to come up with some logic as to
    why a bone graft (LINK) and possibly some other cadaver grafts are
    acceptable to treat, yet other cadaver grafts are not.   
    That way practitioners can make the determination without having to ask on
    the forum every time they encounter a different type of graft.  :)

    I think the moment the anti-rejection medication is not necessary anymore,
    the risk will be limited (I'm always careful to say non-existent..). I
    would also assess the location of the transplant. 
   
    As for making a clear list:
    All foreign tissue always holds the possibility for encapsulation and
    rejection. Even non-tissue elements like breast-implants can be
    encapsulated. But an encapsulation in the breast would not cause any life
    threatening situation, while for example a rejection/encapsulation in the
    brain does hold danger.

    Choices that Johan makes are usually an assessment of the tissue/material
    of an implant and the location the foreign tissue is placed in. A bone
    transplant is fixed in its location, so it will go nowhere once it has been
    placed in the body. A tendon might let go...

    Johan does not have experience with foreign/cadaver tendon. He says better
    safe than sorry.

    Re: the list above for no contraindications #4 stents(metal).  What about
    stents that consist of a polymer or collagen?

    Also, regarding the question about cadaver ligaments and tendons.  So is it
    safe to say we should not treat anyone who has had such a procedure? Even
    though after some time the body's own cells will replace the cadaver?

    I too am curious as to why metal was specified in the first post above when
    there seem to be other materials coming on the market, including polymers
    and plastics.

    It also makes sense to me that grafts would eventually contain none of the
    donor cells.  Much like a blood transfusion that can be treated after a
    year (to be safe) since blood cells only last about 3 months in the body. 
    The trick is that every tissue has different regeneration time frames.  The
    lining of the intestines are replaced every few days and bone can take
    years.  If a surgeon does not see the need to place the patient on
    antirejection medication, I'm wondering if there is a time period in which
    people with various donor parts can be treated? 

    We all rely so heavily on the Chiren for the health of ourselves and our
    families, it is a bit unsettling to think that we could end up with an
    unplanned cadaver graft and be unable to use this wonderful instrument on
    ourselves/family member indefinitely...

    Thank you for asking the question Ember.  I look forward to Johan and
    Karolina's response.

    Stents are placed inside the blood vessels, so there is no danger that the
    body removes the stents, irrespective of the material they are made of.

    I would never do a treatment if there are cadaver ligaments or tendons in
    the body you can never be sure that the body's own cells will replace the
    cadaver.

    I like to add to that that there are a lot of exceptions to medical "rules"

    In one person the ligament might be completely replaced in a certain amount
    of time and in others it is never. 

    I even came across a person who walks around with a "soluble" pin in her
    leg for years… It never did what it was supposed to do… dissolve.

    Johan of course emphasised several times he does not have experience with
    the ligaments, but he just would not risk it.

    I understand why a shunt is a contraindication (often it is shunting fluid
    from a vital organ like the brain where intracranial pressure could quickly
    turn deadly).  And I seem to recall Johan mentioning that he had treated
    someone with a stent going from the Kidney to the bladder (bypassing the
    ureter) which became clogged and needed to be replaced.  Both examples of
    shunts were most likely made from artificial materials just like stents

    Therefore, why can't a stent inside a blood vessel also become clogged?  Or
    is it acceptable to treat a cardiac stent, with the risk that it might
    become clogged, since the heart has a lot of collateral circulation?

    Can a patient with an ileostomy be treated? Is there any chance her body
    could close the hole? That would be very bad. She has Crohns.

    Hi Toril,

    That is an interesting question…

    I think the chance of the hole closing is extremely small as:
    1. A piece of bowel is sticking out of the hole, so the skin around it has
    no direct contact (physically nor energetically)
    2. The skin around that opening does not get any rest to heal because of
    the mechanic working of the bowel
    3. Structural alterations to the body will usually not be corrected by
    Chiren treatment alone

    I personally have no Biontology-experience with clients who have an
    ileostomy. So my ideas are purely theoretical.

    I had a call from a potential client who had a cadaver tendon implant in a
    knee surgery over seven years ago. I let her know that there is a concern
    about possible rejection. 
    She asked if there was any way possible to test to see if there would be a
    rejection. 
    Since it has been over 7 years, it seems that every cell of the body would
    have been replaced by now. 
    Is there any possibility of helping her?

    Barbara: My apologies. It seems that we overlooked your question. There is
    no problem in treating someone pre-surgery.

    Dennis: I do not think that there is a danger to treat him. Those cadaver
    parts are well fixed and grown with the rest now.

    Cadaver bones and tendons are dead material just like metal or plastic and
    theoretically form no danger, but just to make sure it is wise to wait at
    least 6 months after surgery. 7 years should be no problem at all.

    Toril: Thank you for the follow up.

    Johan is in a course until friday. As we answer all questions together I
    will have to wait.

    I can only tell you what Johan has told before, that he hasn't treated
    people with these kind of implants. So for him there is no way of
    predicting what the body is going to do. All other contraindications stem
    from experience, and as we are working with quite a powerful technology
    being careful is suggested.

    Johan: "I have no actual experience with it, but the connection between the
    animal tendon and the body's own tendon can create a problem… Better safe
    than sorry."

    I would explain it like this: As bones and tendons are dead material,
    rejection like in an organ or living-tissue transplant is not so much the
    issue, but it is foreign and the body can start to encapsulate. Hence it is
    better to wait until the body has properly "adopted" the foreign
    materials.

Premature Ventricular Contractions

rondajmcdougalrondajmcdougal
January 2015 edited February 2015 in Case Discussions - Student Flag
Client:
Man, 68 years old, with what he calls "false heart beats"

History:
Had Measles, Mumps & Chicken Pox
Divorced and remarried (1st wife left him in 1985 and he had to raise 3
children - he remarried after children were raised)
Car Accident

Medication:
Prednisone - taken since teenager
Inhaler
Blood pressure medication - twice a day
High cholesterol medication

Symptoms:
Palpitations => 45.000 extra heart beats a day since 2014 (now brought back to
39.000)
Eczema - from birth
Asthma - since 2 years old
Colitis
Kidney Stones
High Blood Pressure
Knee problems (Right Knee Replaced, his left needs replacing also)
Hand joints => large and disfigured
Toe nails => thick and disfigured

Doctor's Diagnosis:
PVC = Premature Ventricular Contraction (LINK Wikipedia)

Medical Treatment:
Vasectomy
Tonsils removed as an adult
Gallbladder removed
Tooth pulled => Tooth Infection (2012 or 2013)
Right Knee Replaced (he says his left needs replacing also)
Ablation (LINK), performed on the top of the heart. Brought extra heart beats
down to 39,000
Fibulator and pace maker to regulate the heart

More info on fibulator and pace maker:
There is a tracking mechanism which monitors and automatically sends heart
information to the doctor at 2 a.m. every day.
Bending over confines blood-flow to the heart & lungs and disturbs the
fibulator = he feels a sort of a shock when this happens. Also if he over
exerts he also has this sensation.

    Hi Ronda, I observe that you are not following some essential guidelines of
    Biontology. Please read the new manual several times. Some pointers about
    this case:

    1. There is no focus, you need to make a good assessment and focus
    accordingly.  
    2. It looks like you don't measure the feet (it is impossible for this man
    to not have any drop on the feet meridians)
    3. Yin organs are treated before the Yang organs are done yet. 
    4. Layers that should have the first focus are skipped (e.g. no remedies
    were tested on the veins/circulation while you did treat the Heart, which
    is a Yin layer)
    5. You are using too many programs (no in between 2-7 program should ever
    be used).
    6. The Kidneys are neglected, while they clearly have a problem looking at
    your symptoms list
    7. Also the Gallbladder must have a problem considering history and
    symptoms, but is not taken into account in any of the sessions.
    Palpitations, his main symptoms, are Gallbladder related.
    8. Vasectomy may delay or block success, even if you would treat him the
    right way. I hope you mentioned this to your client.

    Thank you Johan for your response and time. I hope you can take the time to
    review the items below as I value your insight and correction.

    It is very hard to clearly write out the treatment and thought process
    using very few words and trying to keep the time spent to a minimum.
    Hopefully I have written my thoughts more clearly this time. This has been
    a harder case to figure out, which is why I have presented it to you.

    1. He uses many medications (pretty much all his life) and I believe this
    is blocking accurate measurement. The measurements do not make sense
    according to the symptoms

    2. Medorrhinum (2nd session) matched both Hormone System and Nervous
    System. Since I had an extra slot I placed it in this treatment to balance
    both but only wrote it under the Nervous System.

    3. & 4. In my writing it looks as though I am treating only one thing, when
    indeed that nosode corrected many drops and I sometimes only write it under
    one organ system. It is impossible to write ALL of my thought processes and
    measurements down.

    This is how I addressed the Yang Organs. I did not overlook them. Let me
    know if this is how it should be done according to the protocols:

    1st Session
    Circulation, Veins and Adrenals were completely balanced by Selenium
    Stomach cleared with Brucella Abortus Bang
    I did not write the Selenium as a balancing factor on the hand treatment
    treatment because I used only nosodes and placed the supports in the
    Footplate program.

    I then had room for another nosode which is why I treated with the Coxackie
    virus (Yin organ).
    I thought I could save all supports for the Footplate treatment while using
    the rods on the >12 year program filling with 8 nosodes.

    I have always treated this way and have had excellent results with clients
    symptoms and points clearing with minimal sessions. All clients have been
    extremely happy and have referred many other clients to me because of their
    results. Should I not treat in this way?

    Questions:
    A. Should I not have used Coxsackie even though I had an open slot OR
    should I have used Selenium in the >12 year program instead of saving it
    for the footplates?

    B. Should I not place supports that are balancing points in the footplates
    to create more space for nosodes in the hand treatment?

    2nd Session
    Circulation was corrected by Barijodeel so I used the 2 Calculi for the
    Kidney and Circulation, placing supports for this measurement in the
    Footplates.

    The Yang organs are treated first (not neglected).  My order of focus is
    always: 
    1st Hormone System 
    2nd Bladder / Kidneys (which I support even if there are no drops)
    3rd Circulation / Veins (which I support even if there are no drops) 
    4th Intestines / Stomach / Gallbladder / Lymphatic System (but many of
    these also correct a Yin organ when treating the Yang so it may look as
    though I am treating Yin first if I wrote it down under that drop instead
    of all drops corrected by one nosode). 

    Question:
    C. Are you saying to treat all remedies that are measured right away in the
    Hand Rods before using the Footplates?
   
    5. Question:
    D. So when I remeasure after the >12 years program and I find a drop, am I
    now not to use the 2-7 years program with the matching nosode to correct
    that drop as we were taught? Should I be placing that nosode in the
    footplate instead of the hand treatment?

    E. In the 4th session the Streptococcus Haemolyticus corrected the
    Lymphatic System and Heart, but I had to address Tonsillitis. I was taught
    to always use any Appendix nosode with Tonsil nosode - otherwise I would
    not have run the extra 2-7 years program as everything was corrected upon
    remeasuring). How should this have been done differently?

    F. I also switch some of the supports halfway through as you told us we
    could do.

    6. & 7. Yes, I expected to measure many times on the Kidneys and
    Gallbladder (with his symptoms), but I wanted to remain objective to
    treating with my measurements (as we were taught not think / project
    things).

    8. Yes, I have explained to him about his vasectomy and also the blocking
    effect of medication.

    Questions:
    G. Am I supposed to work on someone such as this (measurements not matching
    symptoms) with intuition and symptom treat them (we were taught not to do
    this but to go by measurement). I have measured him carefully each time to
    be sure I am not mis-measuring as the measurements have not been what I
    expected.


    Treatment 5th Session
    I saw him again today and measured very carefully and there definitely were
    no drops on the feet. I went ahead and treated the Kidney and Gallbladder
    (even though we were taught only to treat what shows itself). I was waiting
    for the Gallbladder to show since it was removed so it was definitely
    degenerated. 
   
    Skin conditions are in the water element (not showing because of all his
    steroids masking I assume). These points didn't drop, but when I placed the
    following in the slots the tone remained even so I used them.
    Adenomyose Gallenblase, Injeel Chol (Gallbladder), Bact. Pyo, Bact Proteus
    (kidney / bladder) 

    I have most always had the Gallbladder show up right away even on healthy
    clients so I was continually surprised when his never showed especially
    since it was removed / degenerated but still there energetically.

    1. If you know your measurements cannot be trusted, you need to navigate on
    symptoms and also try to get the body to the point of showing a more
    accurate picture.

    The following procedure should be followed when the measurement does not
    reflect the condition:
    a. Look at your own measuring techniques
    b. Look at skin condition (e.g. dryness, ointments)
    c. Think of endorphins. If you only suspect masking of points on meridians
    that are not part of your focus in this session, you can just leave them
    and after detoxification they may show the next session.
    If relevant meridians are masked by endorphins, like for example the
    Kidneys when there is Arthritis, you can treat them with support remedies
    and then see if they start showing themselves within the same session. But
    sometimes this takes more time and you will start to see drops the next
    session.
    d. If there is no point dropping at all (a complete endorphin mask) you can
    measure with Plumbum, Viscum and Atropinum. Only when you cannot measure
    anything that helps you to navigate on you need to unblock endorphins this
    way.

    Lowering endorphins can be done by removing toxins, but for this to happen
    the Kidneys and Large Intestine must come right. In this specific case I
    would have used all the Intestinal Flora nosodes together with ALL Kidney
    support remedies in one of the treatments . 

    2. This is quite an unusual measurement. Where did you measure it on the
    Hormone System? Usually when you measure the most common remedies, you will
    have solved the drops before ever needing this one.

    3&4 When you are focussing on a meridian, you also need to measure your
    nosodes on this meridian and not the other way around (measuring remedies
    on other meridians and then coming back to see if the meridian of focus is
    corrected also). For example if you suspect Gallbladder problems being the
    underlying cause of drops on the diabetes point (insulin low), you don't go
    to the Gallbladder meridian to test for nosodes, but you try to match
    Gallbladder remedies on the Insulin point.
    Liver nosodes and Heavy Metals should not be used early on in treatment,
    even if they seem to be necessary to correct drops on the meridians of
    focus. Usually there is another way around this. More than one remedy may
    match. Only when you have been treating for some time and then there is for
    example no other way to correct the Gallbladder than using a Liver nosode,
    this may be a choice that needs to be made. But never recklessly you always
    need to stay aware of what you are doing, the effect it may have on the
    body and the resulting consequences.

    "Circulation, Veins and Adrenals were completely balanced by Selenium" This
    is impossible and this causes me to suspect a measurement problem.

    Comments 1st Session
    I again suggest you read the new manual thoroughly, because there things
    are better explained than they ever were. I always told people to focus,
    but this was not understood well.
    The manual describes how you should focus on the first layers first and not
    go beyond 3 layers at a time. The first session you will never get to any
    of the YIN organs.

    A. if you have a slot left in the hand treatment, you can fill it in with a
    support or leave it open. More nosodes is not better, so if you have
    corrected the layers of focus with less than 8 nosodes this is fine and you
    should not go on to other layers to find more nosodes. This will only lead
    to a less focussed (and thus less effective) treatment.
    In any case you do not fill the empty slot with a nosode matching one or
    more YIN organs. Especially when the YANG organs are not clear yet.

    B. There are only few supports that are used to balance points (e.g.
    Selenium, Barijodeel), otherwise you should not try to balance points with
    support remedies and always try to find nosodes. This is possible in most
    cases. Then use the support for the organs treated in the hand treatment
    and/or footplate treatment. You should not take a remedy (whether nosode or
    support) out of the hand treatment to create space, since you will need to
    remeasure to assess if the remedy indeed worked. If it didn't you will
    still have the footplate treatment available to treat with the one or two
    remedies that are still needed.

    Comments 2nd Session
    The Bladder comes in the protocol only after the Gallbladder (unless the
    main problem is the Bladder)

    You may follow -almost- the right order of treatment, but you are treating
    too many meridians at the same time and also too early on in treatment. You
    can only start to treat the YIN meridians when the YANG meridians are
    ready. This is shown in improved measurements and organ function, but often
    the decision to include the next layer in treatment is also based on how
    many sessions a client already had, because every session causes
    detoxification and lowers the toxic burden on the body.

    I also noticed that the Parathyroid is not corrected yet in the 2nd (also
    3rd session). At this stage it is a waste of space to put Barijodeel and
    Calculi remedies in because the main underlying cause of the
    calcifications, the Parathyroid, is not dealt with yet.

    C. Indeed, all the remedies (mainly nosodes) you measure should be put in
    the hand treatment immediately.

    D. If after the hand treatment you do still find a drop, you leave that
    drop. There is no need to immediately find a remedy for it. If the organ is
    a YANG organ of focus, you might find a nosode that you then put in with
    the Footplate treatment.

    E. Often the Appendicitis and Tonsillitis affect each other, but that does
    not happen always. WHEN it happens they need to be treated together, but if
    you don't measure Tonsillitis you don't need to use it. You can however use
    support remedies for Tonsillitis (Tonsillitis and Anginheel) when you have
    measured/treated for Appendicitis

    I have never used or taught a 2-7 years program in between the normal hand
    treatment and footplate treatment. If you need extra nosodes (don't use
    more than 8 altogether) you can put them on the footplates.

    There is no need to balance all the points every session. Important is that
    organs are treated in the right
    sequence. The extra 2-7 treatment causes another detox reaction which we
    are trying to avoid. Experience has shown this is unnecessary burden for
    the body and often delays healing and possibly causes more heavy reactions.

    F. Changing remedies on the footplates during treatment is something that
    can be done, but in order to not overdose on remedies or divert the bodies
    energy in too many directions I would advise to not do this with more than
    half (4) of the remedies.

    6&7 The objectivity is mainly important during measurement, because you
    don't want to force your own ideas on what you measure. I have seen a lot
    of "pet subjects" of practitioners that influence accurate measurements.
    You need to have a completely blank mind without expectations when you
    measure. BUT when you then have the results of your measurements you can
    see patterns in them, and you can assess of things make sense or not. 

    A lot of symptoms are clearly caused by Kidney malfunctioning. This man has
    rheumatoid arthritis, which is caused by Kidney malfunction. Blood pressure
    medication also causes Kidney malfunction. Originally stress might have
    exhausted the Adrenal glands and this often causes also Kidney
    insufficiency that then caused the other problems.
    Another indication that points toward Kidney problems is the serious form
    of Appendicitis. If one finds Appendicitis, one can be certain that the
    Intestinal Flora causes problems elsewhere. That elsewhere is in any case
    the Kidneys and Bladder. The Intestinal Flora nosodes can be used to
    reintroduce the flora, but also to remove the bacteria from organs where
    they do not belong. The introduction of the Intestinal Flora into the Large
    Intestine should be saved until the Appendix does not react anymore on
    Appendicitis. After this you should try Diverticulosis and/or the
    Intestinal Flora. But to remove the bacteria from other organs you can use
    them straight away. In this case those bacteria are used as nosodes and not
    as support.
    I would advise to treat with the Intestinal Flora anyway, since you cannot
    trust the measurements.  
   
    The "false heartbeats" are clearly caused by the Gallbladder system. The
    lack of drop there can be caused by endorphins, but since you don't measure
    any drops at all on the feet (assuming you do measure the feet) while you
    do measure them on the hands there is a problem with the accuracy of
    measurement on the feet.. Prednisone use can cause severe swelling of
    fingers and toes, which make the measurements almost impossible. When there
    is such swelling you will not measure the skin conduction in the point, but
    just the conduction of the water in the swollen tissue. This may be the
    cause of the lack of drops. All kinds of aspects that influence measurement
    are mentioned int he new manual. 

    Prednison will slow the body's reaction, but does not cause endorphins.
    Endorphins are caused by stress of the body and this stress could be
    physical, emotional, chemical and/or emotional stress. 

    G. No, this is not what you should do. You really need to take all advise
    above into account and try to make decisions based on insight in the
    overall condition and measurements of the client. You can only start to see
    the whole picture when you learn and understand all aspects of Biontology.
    This is also why we created the forum. Biontology is not as simple as "just
    getting all the points straight". There is much to learn. I think this case
    is very informative for many practitioners. Thank you for putting all this
    effort in presenting the case Ronda. We truly appreciate that. 

    Comments 5th Session
    Skin conditions are not in the Water element. The skin condition can
    reflect many internal problems. Sometimes it can indeed be the Kidneys, but
    there can be many other causes. Eczema is usually a Circulatory issue.

    On this forum and in classes I have emphasised many times that when there
    are clearly problems with an organ, even if it is not showing in the
    measurement, this needs attention. You need to find ways to get to the
    point that measurements correlate with the symptoms again.

    Thank you Johan for this extensive information. This is very helpful to me
    as well as to all who will take the time to read this.

    The new manual is most detailed for all to learn from and I have intended
    to read it several times once I received it, knowing how much more I can
    learn from it (that is time I need to begin setting aside faithfully). I
    did this with the old manual and found new things and more understanding
    each time. Thank you Karolina for so much time and work put forth for us to
    learn from this manual and remedy book.

    There is so much continuing to learn and deepening my understanding of
    Biontology that one could never stop learning throughout a lifetime. Thank
    you Johan for your willingness to share your creativity and inspiration to
    teach all of us the use of your brilliant invention...and thank you for
    your patience!! Thank you so much Karolina for all you do...we appreciate

    Thank you Ronda! 

    But I wonder if you have received the link to download the new manual,
    since you write: "I have intended to read it several times once I received
    it". We don't send out a printed edition, so everyone needs to print and
    bind it themselves. 
   
    The Biontology Manual will be updated soon, since the last pages with
    combined hands/feet and meridians that were added last (and unfortunately I
    assumed them to be OK) contain some mistakes.
    But for now you can download the current manual using this LINK

Measuring Hepatitis C - Without a Known Cause for Infection

kathrynhowardkathrynhoward
April 2013 edited March 2014 in Measurement Flag
Johan said Hepatitis A non B was Hepatitis C in a recent class.

Question: 
How is it possible to resonate with Hepatitis C when one has not ever had the
vaccine, never known anyone with the disease, never had a transfusion...? 

Have you seen people resonate with this without a cause they know about - and
no symptoms?

    Hi Kathryn,

    Just one comment..... Similarity Principle...

    You don't have to actually have anything you measure for, that is why we
    can't diagnose! 
    But if you measure for Hep A non B, you sure have resonance to this
    condition, so instead of the actual Hep C virus you might have another
    inflammatory condition of the Liver. Hep A non B is a remedy that is
    measured for frequently in clients, who don't have this actual medical
    condition.

    it didn't work. I wanted you and Johan both to know that the only reason I
    brought up the Hepatitis again, was because I got an email from Dennis
    about it. He asked if Hep A B = C...and I told him that Johan taught us
    that a long time ago. I also told him to ask the Q on the Forum, just in
    case others did not know this, too. I was not asking a second time the same

Borrelia - Gastrointestinal Infection

toneoj
February 2013 edited February 2014 in Biontology Insights Flag
Last week I met a new client, 53 year old woman, with a lot of infections in
her body.

Medical history:
All childhood diseases
In 3 years of age, they operated her tonsils out
Intolerance to milk and gluten since she was a little girl
She has gotten all the vaccines according to the Norwegian vaccination program

In 2007 she got a heavy Food Poisoning from a beefsteak. They found two amoebas
that she can`t remember the name of. After this she got very sick.
 
Because of the gastrointestinal infection, she got antibiotics, but also some
medication to high the level of macrophages. According to client “this went
wrong, and all the bacterias and viruses in her body exploded”. She struggles
with coxacie, epstein barr, mycoplasma, anaplasma, bortella and a lots of other
viruses and bacterias. She also takes pentasa, an anti-inflammatory medicine.

They have now found borrelia infection, and believe this is the reason why she
is sick. She remember being bit in the 90`s. She got immediately dizzy and her
leg got swollen. But she did not get any more symptoms at that time.

She gets antibiotics intravenously, and she takes antibiotic in pillform every
day.

Symptoms:
Brainfog, cramps, feeling of abdominal pain and burning, low energy, muscle
aches, pain in her jaw and teeth. Headaches on the top of her head/ and in the
front. She almost gets no sleep anymore. Wakes up constantly in the night.

1.Session:
Drops on Hormonal System, Urinary Bladder, Kidneys, Circulation, Gallbladder,
Stomach (Liver high sounds), and very low sounds on Small- and Large
Intestines.

First: Whiplash, Spin-Inversion treatment. Scar-treatment.
12 years: Anti-tetanus, Polio, Serum Ovile, Podophyllum, Diverticulose,
Carcinoma Coli, Brucella Abortus Bang, Gastritis, (Got a heavy headache during
treatment)

2-7 years: Support to Kidneys/Urinary Bladder, Circulation

Footplates: Thalamus, Viscum, Cerebrum, Atropinum, Selenium, Belladonna,
Solidago, Veratrum (her headache disappeared)

My thinking:
I believe the main cause is not the Borrelia, but has to be found somewhere in
her Stomach/Intestines? This because of the client`s history, and because of
the symptoms. 
Her appendix has to be necrotizing and chronic infected I think, also because
of all the antibiotics... When this is better, I have to take a look at
Gallbladder and Liver that I also believe is affected. 
Her symptoms started when she got a foodpoisoning I 2007, not when she got the
ticks in the 90`s. But of course it doesn`t help. What do you think? Maybe I am
wrong, so please be free to correct me!

Other question:

1. She is taking a lot of antibiotics, so I am wondering how effective the
treatment will be, when we try to strengthen the body, and then she goes home
and eat antibiotics? I usually do not treat clients while they take
antibiotics, but in this case she got biontology recommended from the hospital
in Germany despite taking antibiotic treatment. Johan/Karolina – what do you
say about this?

2. She is taking a lot of probiotics and food supplement, and I cannot see that
this is much effective when there is no healthy climate in the intestines at
all?

3. She has the name of a lot of bacterias and viruses that are not in the
Chiren. But if we strenghtens the body on other levels, maybe the body will fix
this itself? Or?

Really looking forward to hear from you!

    Hi

    I agree with you that the Borrelia is not the cause. The cause is likely to
    be Brucella Abortus Bang and/or Brucellosis.

    The fact that she takes anti-biotics intravenously does not make the
    situation any better. If she takes antibiotics orally it is bad enough, but
    IV is worse. She puts so many extra toxins in her body.

    The supplements and probiotics are useless if her digestive system is like
    it is and might even harm it more.

    It is always essential to get the terrain right. Removing bacteria is
    helpful to take the clutter away so that we can see the real issues.

    For her sleep disorder: I would suggest Schwefheel.

    For the rest: it seems to be mainly the digestive system that causes all of
    the symptoms. I would ask her if her situation has improved since she has
    been taking the anti-biotics. If not, then stop using them. Anti-biotics
    have never worked against any viruses and bacteria they only suppress but
    do not kill.

    If she was already allergic to gluten and milk when she was a little child,
    her digestive system was already attacked then. I am convinced that she has
    a necrotisizing appendix and that this one is causing  a lot of the
    problems. A lot of the gluten and milk intolerances are caused by food
    poisoning, espcially the Salmonellas.

    Treat for the Food Poisonings and the Appendicitis / Tonsillitis first.
    Appendicitis and Tonsillitis are responsible for many infections/
    inflammations in the body.

    Please ask her for the name of the doctor and the German hospital that
    referred her to us. This is very interesting.

    Hi!

    I asked her the first time if her situation got improved when she started
    her antibiotic treatment, she said yes, and that she finally managed to get
    out of bed because of it.

    I have been treating this woman today, and she told me that her stomach/
    intestines has been better in the weekend. Today I have treated her
    tonsills and appendix, the energy on her intestines was also better than
    the first time. This is very interesting, I will keep you posted.  

    Name of the Clinic in Germany that has recommended biontology: Clinic BCA -
    Borreliose Centrum Augsburg. Drs.Nicolaus & Schwarzbach.

    Question:

    About this kind of clients with borrelia and antibiotic treatmens: Strange
    enough, I got another call today from at mother to a 14 year old girl
    diagnosed with ME/CFS. She also gets antibiotic treatment in Germany
    because of borrelia. But for this girl the situation was NOT improved,
    rather the opposite. But the doctors in the clinic had told them that this
    can happen, before it will make a shift and be better.

     We talked about antibiotic and what it can do to the body and especially
    to the stomach/intestines. I also said that I usually do not treat people
    while they are using antibiotics. But in this case I am a little
    bit confused because of the other woman that I treat, who probably gets
    help from biontology anyway, and because of the recommondation from
    the clinic in Germany. I told the mom that I would ask you, for clarity,
    and call her back in a few days.

    What do you say Johan, when you get a call like this? I feel that I can
    help this girl, but I am sceptic because of her antibiotic-treatment
    and her reaction to it. Maybe she is willing to stop taking the
    antibiotics, to give this treatment a try... I don`t know yet.

    I would treat her. The antibiotics will not kill the Borrelia, only
    suppress the reaction of the body. It is never the bacteria, always the
    terrain. The terrain is bad so it attracts the bacteria but it is always
    the terrain which is at fault.
    And if there was no improvement, the practitioner might have overlooked a
    Spin Inversion or has not(yet) identified the real cause. But although
    antibiotics destroy Intestinal Flora and Stomach linings, they should still
    not block treatment.

    Hello again Johan!

    The client with borrelia and stomach / intestinal infection came to her
    third treatment today. There had been little changes since the last time.
    We treated with coxacie, app necro, tons, bill chirrhosis the last time.

    Anyway, the client came in today and was a bit dissatisfied because she
    believes I can only help if we take away the following disturbances (this
    according to her borrelia- experts):
    Babesia
    Anaplasma
    Mycoplasma
    Bartonella

    She was very clear that all this must be removed before we can deal with
    borrelia infection and stomach / intestinal infection. She believes it is
    the borrelia that makes her so sick, not the stomach / intestinal infection
    that you and I have emailed about before.

    I also think it is difficult to try to explain that I treat her based on
    her symptoms and how she actually feels, because she is really into her
    diagnose, and has a lot of knowledge about this. Today she totally "run me
    over" with all this knowledge. 

    She will not continue with the treatment if I do not get these particular
    parasites / bacterias into the chiren ...

    I think this is sad, because we both felt that we had actually done
    something good for her body when she was here one week ago. So I am not
    quite sure what has made the shift.

    I told her that I wanted to confer with you. I think it is a difficult
    case, and the meeting today did not felt good. She is my first client with
    borrelia- and a lot of co-infections. And I really would like to give her
    good treatments.

    What is your experience with this? And what would you tell her about the
    parasites and bacterias she insist to be put into the chiren?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    March 2013 edited March 2013 Flag
    She sounds like someone with a lot of fear and control issues. Usually when
    you start treating with the Chiren, emotions that are connected to the
    disease come up (especially when Liver and/or Gallbladder are addressed). 
    This is a natural thing, but of course difficult to deal with if you have a
    problem with your own boundaries. Especially since she projects the fear
    and anger she feels onto you. She thinks you are the one who lets her
    down.... doesn't listen to her etc.

    I wouldn't go into a fight over who is right or wrong and maybe I would
    even put the parasites/bacteria in just for the placebo effect of it. She's
    just so convinced this is what is necessary..... Why not give it to her,
    while  you know that you have to focus on deeper issues at the same time.
    But while I might do this, the more important thing I would definitely do
    at the same time is address her anger, control and lack of faith. 

    I would ask her why she comes to me and then doesn't have any faith in me.
    This is not natural behaviour when you seek someones help (don't put it
    this way though, she'll feel attacked easily, since she's actually very
    vulnerable ;-)) 
    I would ask and ask until we hit the core.... If you seek out someones help
    you have to at least have a little faith that he/she knows what he/she is
    doing. Why would you go to a therapy/therapist that you doubt in the first
    place....? Or does she doubt in general...? Has she been supported
    throughout her life? Who has let her down in such a way that now she has
    the feeling she has to do everything herself? What does she feel in
    general, does she feel safe...? When did she start feeling so insecure?...
    things like that. 
    Observe, listen and reflect back to her what she's doing/projecting. If
    she's angry that you don't listen to her.... Was there anybody that didn't
    listen to her in the past? 
    Do this without tension or judgement though, she is likely traumatised and
    has all her energy on the outside as a defence mechanism. Just be curious
    as to why she reacts the way she does.

    Then I would also explain (in general terms) that growing up in an
    unsupportive and stressful environment creates a lack of basic trust. That
    this gives a tense disposition throughout life, which causes the immune
    system to fail. And that this is exactly the common factor we've found in
    all clients with Lyme: trauma and especially abuse of some form. 

    The Lyme parasite is just an opportunistic inhabitant that only creates
    havoc when the condition of body and soul is weak. You can explain that
    Biontology has such good results with Lyme, because unlike other therapies
    it doesn't attack the Lyme specifically, but it allows clients to get
    stronger to not be bothered by parasites or bacteria anymore. Everybody (no
    exception) is full of many bacteria/parasites, that's natural, but not
    everybody is ill. Someone who has had chickenpox will always carry the
    virus, but not everybody will get shingles. Only when one gets exhausted
    (fighting through life is exhausting) these inhabitants will create
    symptoms. 


    But for this whole approach to work you have to be secure in yourself. J
    udging from your description, this woman is used to projecting her fear
    outward, so this won't be an easy conversation. 
    You might want to choose not to go there at all, and just say "if you don't
    trust me as a therapist there's nothing I can do for you."

    You can also explain that sometimes emotions come up stronger because of
    the treatment and that this might cause her to feel more frustrated/
    irritated etc.

    This is how I would handle things, but I'm of course a different person
    than you and might have a different style. 

    I think the main thing is that you have to be open to really listen to her.
    If she feels you do hear her, you might be surprised that at one point
    she'll be open to your suggestions too... Again there's no harm in giving
    her a little bit of Borelia nosode as long as you know that other issues
    are more important. 


    Not an easy case though, good luck!

    Hello Karolina :-)

    Thanks for the good answer. I really agree with you, and have thought much
    the same. I always talk with clients about traumas and feelings, but with
    this lady it has been difficult. I have felt a wall - and there you have it
    - her defense mechanism. And yes, I've obviously triggered something when
    we started to treat her gallbladder.

    I always have respect for my clients, so I did not go into any "fight". I
    listened to her, and told her I wanted to talk to you about it. She said in
    plain words - that if I did not treat Mycoplasma, Anaplasma, Babesia and
    Bartonella first, she would not come back. We have an agreement that she
    will hear from me during the week, and she will then decide on whether to
    continue or not (and of course if I wants to continue).

    She is generally skeptical of both doctors and therapists, but has great
    faith in borrelia-experts. She went to quantum medicine (I am not quite
    sure if that is the right word, in norwegian we say: “kvantemedisin”)
    before, without any effect. Det same with homopati. It seems that she draws
    some lines between biofotontherapy and this.

    Anyway, I've worked a lot with this case. I think I'll try to explain to
    her in a gentle way. But she must, as you say, also have faith in me as a
    therapist, I think otherwise it becomes difficult for me to help. I must be
    true to biontology, chiren and what I believe in. To be honest, I am not
    sure that it is the right thing to continue. But maybe that is my fear, I
    have to feel what is right and talk to my client.

    I have not Mycoplasma, Anaplasma and Babesia in my Chiren. Do you? I
    remember that Johan once said the important things are in the chiren, we do
    not need anything else. So if I put in Oxyuren, cat's claw (bartonella?),
    trichomonads, Lyme, Q-fever, toxoplasmosis, tuberculinum etc, it will still
    be wrong for this client, because she just wants the bacterias/parasites
    mentioned, otherwise she will quit. She also says that there is no point
    that I treat with Lyme, as I have not taken the other four out first. She
    wants a clear answer if I actually have the opportunity do get mycoplasma,
    anaplasma, and babesia into my chiren…

    Hello Tone,

    It is difficult to change the "target approach" way of thinking, that has
    been the way of western medicine for so long. Even though people might
    think they're open to a new way of healing/thinking, they often take the
    basics (dogma's) of old belief systems and superpose those on the
    "alternative new way" that they adopt. So in our therapy this would mean
    that the Chiren is used as a shotgun to kill parasites, which isn't the way
    you'll get the best results. It stems from not understanding how biophotons
    and the Chiren work. 
    Treating holistically doesn't mean using a lot of modalities at the same
    time to have more "fire power" to finally kill the bugs, it means having
    awareness of every aspect of human nature and the interactions with the
    environment at the same time so you can see and treat the whole. 

    The Chiren doesn't kill anything, it assists the body in restoring its
    proper (immune) functioning so no parasite will create a problem anymore.
    This is far more effective than fighting parasites, because if you kill
    one, another one will create a new problem in the weakened system.... an
    endless cycle.

    Biontology is not the same as giving a pill to treat one aspect of a
    failing system. If you would use the Chiren as a shotgun, you don't
    practice Biontology but are just treating symptoms. Clients will get some
    temporary relief, but need to continue for a very long time this way. (It
    is like killing mosquitos, when the real solution would be getting rid of
    the pool.) Good for the wallet, but not our goal. We want to set clients
    free in as little treatments as possible. It is absolutely possible to help
    clients within a limited number of sessions. If we don't we're missing
    something,... 

    Aiming a shotgun at the different bacteria and parasites is the same as
    focussing on a symptom with a pill. It is not even touching on the cause
    and for that reason will only give some symptom relief. 
    Lyme patients usually are bothered by many viruses, bacteria and parasites
    not just Borrelia, Babesia and Bartonella. However, if you do want to find
    remedies for them I would suggest to go to a good homeopathic pharmacy and
    create nosodes like we have in the Chiren (load the D12, D30 and D200
    potencies at the same time).

    Nosodes that are standard available in the Chiren, and that might help with
    the symptoms of Lyme and co-infections or have similarities with them are:
    Brucella Abortus Bang, Lyme's Disease (of course), Febris Wolhynica,
    Luesinum, Malaria and Toxoplasmosis.

    Cat's Claw is an herb and not a nosode.


    Another note about your client's situation: 
    It's easier to belief one has a couple of parasites/bacteria/viruses that
    can be blamed for all problems then to accept that the main issue is a
    systemic one. The first assumption gives more safety, because then, if you
    are able to kill the bug, everything will be fine. It is again easier to
    project an enemy outside than to accept something has to be dealt with/
    healed within. 

    Or in other words: if she can't fight a cause of her illness (scapegoat),
    she has to trust her own body to heal by itself and faith is just what is
    missing..... 
    She's happy with the diagnosis Lyme because this gives something to focus
    on, a sense of control... This is just something to realise about the
    client, not something to act on. The way she reacts is a symptom of her
    whole condition. 
    Asking the right questions might allow her to realise herself what causes
    her frustration and fear and how she has developed patterns that help her
    to deal with these feelings...

    Also I have to emphasize again that all these infections probably are there
    and that I'm not saying it is all in her head, or that solving an emotional
    problem will get rid of all her symptoms. The emotional issues are however
    a big part of her illness, and allowing her to talk about it to create
    awareness, is a very important aspect of her healing process. The
    combination has to be: treating the terrain & assisting awareness around
    old patterns that come up because of the treatment (this is done by asking
    questions and truly listening).

    Thanks again Karolina :) 

    I do understand what you are saying. I do believe that I have treated the
    terrain pretty good, but I could have done better by being more aware
    around the old patterns and her feelings ... 

    And I do not want to put in more Parasites or Bacteria in Chiren, I just
    needed a good way to explain it to her, because she believes that this is
    the only way to help her. 

    Now I have a lot of answers, It is great to have a forum like this.

    Thanks for your answer!

    Hello again. 
    Sorry, but now I'm totally confused here. I read through all this
    information, and I guess there is something that I do not understand
    anyway... 
   
    Karonlina you wrote: "The Chiren doesn't kill anything, it assists the body

    problem anymore. This is far more effective than fighting parasites,
    because if you kill one, another one will create a new problem in the

    Johan wrote: "I agree with you that the Borrelia is not the cause. The
    cause is likely to be Brucella Abortus Bang and/or Brucellosis. It is
    always essential to get the terrain right. Removing bacteria is helpful to
    take the clutter away so that we can see the real issues"

    When I have treated for instance the Toxoplasmose and the Brucella Abortus
    Bang, does the body not remove it? Don't we neutralise the frequency of
    this bacteria/virus? Is it not gone then???

    I've always thought that we are helping the body removing the disturbances/
    bacterias/viruses. 
    But it is only the symptoms that these create that is removed? 
    And that this is often the cause of the symptoms, even though they are not
    the real cause (I now understand that I have a lot to learn...) 
    But I thought that  removing them we can also support the body in a better
    way? So that the client will not be sick again?

    The client told me that a friend of her got treated for Chlamydia
    Pneumoniae, and got better at once. In this case I believe the bacteria was
    removed form the body??? But if the Chiren doesn`t kill anything... how is
    that possible??? Or is it not gone, it is still there, but doesn`t create a
    problem?

    How do you explain to your clients when you are treating Brucella / Lyme's/
    Toxoplasmose etc? 

    For instance in this case when my client got sick, it was after having
    after beaf steak. I found Brucella Abortus Bang, and was thinking that this
    is the cause and I have to treat the Stomach/Intestines and focus on that.
    Also because of the clientes history... Johan agreed with that.

    She is asking and asking, and I thought I had some good answers, but now I
    am totally confused... I have to look at it from the bright side, this will
    probably help me giving even better treatments... :)

    Yes, thank you for being observant.... 
    I've read the "contradiction" myself too. But since it is a whole
    explanation that I have to do, I didn't really feel like writing about it.
    Now you've asked me directly, I have to..... ;-) 

    It is the use of words that is confusing. The information in nosodes is
    homeopathic information, Johan always says it is opposite but this is a
    theory or working model. 
    What is observed in research/treatment is that the potencies above D9 have
    an opposite effect from the bacteria or disease-causing-information inside
    the body. 
    But when tissue with bacteria is treated with the bacterial nosode and the
    result is observed under a microscope, the bacteria are not killed. 
    What happens though is that the interaction between bacteria and tissue
    completely changes, the bacteria don't bother the tissue anymore. So either
    the bacteria have become more friendly or passive or the immunity of the
    tissue cells (terrain) protects the tissue from further harm. Either way,
    the result is wellness.

    By treating we are removing disturbances in the light, which steers the
    body. It is like Johan often says: "the Chiren doesn't do the healing, the
    body heals itself!" By giving the body the right information the body is
    going to eliminate bacteria/parasites itself. So the bacteria are not
    destroyed directly by the treatment. 
    Otherwise bacteria would always be eliminated immediately just by one
    treatment. But this is not always the case, you can observe that in therapy
    resistance.... So the body itself plays a big role in the elimination of
    the bacteria.

    I hope this makes sense. The "working model" is very nice in explaining the
    process to clients, but I think we should know what we are working with....
    It is the body that has to do the healing.
    And also, we have a beautiful healing modality in our hands, but what truly
    happens inside the body is still not fully understood.

    How I explain the process to clients varies with their need for real
    understanding or curiosity. I often just use the "working model" of
    opposite information killing bacteria. Most clients just want to heal,
    others are more 'scientific' in their mindset.

    The examples of treatment that you gave are still valid. Sometimes you have
    a causative factor like Chlamydia Pneumoniae or Brucella Abortus Bang, that
    you have to address directly (you'll find that by measurement) and it is
    solved immediately after treatment. But like you said, you also have to
    focus on the affected area (organs) at the same time to have good results.
    The only thing that might be different after this explanation is your
    understanding of what happens when you treat. This insight might help in
    future decisions that you make in your treatments.

    Also Johan often says "... this is the cause". This means that this is the
    remedy that is needed and helpful to treat the condition, but because of
    the similarity principle Brucella Abortus Bang works on all conditions that
    have similar symptoms and measuring it doesn't mean this bacteria is
    actually there (it can very well be another bacteria/parasite with similar
    symptoms). So we can't use the Chiren in a diagnostic way that is very
    specific.... 
    If we measure a bacterial nosode in the Stomach or Intestines, this of
    course is a sign of food poisoning, but we don't have all bacteria in the
    Chiren and still we can balance every infection out.... this is because we
    don't have to be that specific. 

    I hope this helps....

    Hi Margit,

    You can just tell them the truth. That once you've had chickenpox, the
    virus will always remain dormant in your Nervous System, but that's true
    for every healthy person too. Some people never get Shingles. 

    Tell them to take care of themselves, watch their stress levels, be careful
    with EMF's, don't exhaust themselves, and especially follow their heart.
    People only get sick from the viruses/bacteria/parasites present in their
    body when they're in a weakened condition.

    Thank you, Karolina, for such a good explanation.

    I still have a question. So all the nosodes we have in the Chiren are
    inverted frequencies? Is it right?
    Or is it just a working model?
    You say:
    "The information in nosodes is homeopathic information, Johan always says
    it is opposite but this is a theory or working model. 
    What is observed in research/treatment is that the potencies above D9 have
    an opposite effect from the bacteria or disease-causing-information inside
    the body. "

    What about potencies below D9? D4 or D8 that have been used in some
    compositum remedies?
    Thank you for helping to better understand the process of choosing and
    using the remedies.

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    Hi Irina,

    Nosodes are homeopathic remedies and are not created by inverting
    frequencies, although this might be the result since it is observed that
    the higher potencies have this opposite effect in the body... So it is a
    hypothesis that by potentizing the frequencies invert. 
    We can use it in therapy because it doesn't matter whether it is opposite
    frequencies or just opposite effect, because in practice it is about the
    results..

    The lower potencies in homeopathy have a direct/stimulating effect. So if
    they are nosodes, which are made from disease causing substances, they will
    aggravate a condition (used to stimulate the immune reaction in
    homeopathy). But with the light filtering of the Chiren they won't have
    this effect. Maybe they have no effect at all....

    The lower potencies are especially useful if they are beneficial substances
    like some herbs, healthy organ tissue, vitamins, citric acid cycle
    components etc. Most compositae have many of those and if they have nosodes
    in them those are usually the higher potencies anyway.

    where you suggested
    treating several times a week using the 2-7 year program, with 2 days rest
    in between, for a
    dialysis client. Would this be best?

    Answers:
    1) I would use only nosodes/toxins that match dropping points on the
    Kidneys, for the rest use supports for Kidneys. This would mean a maximum
    of two or three nosodes/toxins.
    2) My advice would be to treat no more than once every 5 days with the
    normal program. This is still the best.
    The recommendation you are referring to is only valid in highly critical
    cases, and this is not the situation for your client who receives dialysis.

Palliative Chemo Advice please

janjan
February 2013 edited February 2014 in Medication Flag
A prospective new client called that has stage 4 prostate cancer, and the
medical community says they can do nothing more for him, so they have put him
on palliative chemo (alleviating symptoms not the cause, usually when there is
no hope). 

He wants to know if I can treat him, hoping for a miracle. I know in most cases
you advise wait until the chemo is finished, then treat. In this case the chemo
won't be finished...until he is gone. I feel they are slowly poisoning him. I
do believe we can help detox the chemo. 

What would you advise in this case? I don't want to give false hope,yet I don't
want to turn away someone asking for help.

    This client has metastasized prostate cancer with lymphs in pelvic area
    involved and spinal tumors, he has blood in his urine and fecal
    incontinence, with pain from the tumor down his back and down his legs.  He
    started one dose of infusion chemo and decided it was not for him. He is
    stopping chemo (with no request to do so from me) and does want to begin
    biophoton therapy immediately.   I have told him this is quite advanced but
    that I always do believe in miracles and since he is so willing we will see
    what we can do with this. 

    This is just an update from what I posted above asking what I should advise
    him.  He advised me THIS is what he wants to do, so now it is resolved.  I
    will keep you advised and will welcome any suggestions once I start

    First try to find out what type of tumors there are. See if his Spine,
    Large Intestine, Bladder react to Breast Cancer, Liver Cancer, Colon
    Cancer.
    It could match to each one of these types or even to a few of them.

    Prostate cancer is usually caused by exhaustion of the Adrenals. But
    incontinence indicates a Liver problem (weakness of the sphincter muscle). 
    Where does the blood in his urine come from?
     
    You will have to find the central cause of the tumors.

    assistance. 

    Improvements after two treatments: sleeping better, less bladder
    incontinence, and slightly less back pain. I did use a lot of bladder
    remedies.  He has decided not to use chemo, or the vitamin C drips or the
    rife machine...only this.

    I did not measure for Carcinoma Coli, which I will the next treatment I
    have measured Chronic Appendicitis and Appendicitis and will check for
    Carcinoma Coli.

    Yes, with the spinal reaction, I mean his Nervous System. 
   
    But the spine reaction could also be caused by a Bladder problem. The one
    remedy that can affect both systems is the Bact. Proteus. It is known to
    cause Meningitis and Bladder Infections + Prostatitis. 
    This means one cause (or homeopathic similarity) for all problems.

    So at least treat with Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus and see what other
    Vaccinations show up, Don't forget Mercury (but not in the first
    treatment!).

    Answer:
    1. I would try to test on the child itself. Otherwise you would need to

    Answer
    Stiff legs can indicate:
    * A Circulation disturbance in the Arteries and Veins
    * A form of rheumatism, whereby the uric acid is dumped in the tissues

    In the first place I would follow the normal protocol: 
    Hormone system and Kidneys first, and then I would focus on the
    Circulation. 
   
    If measurements are hardly possible because of Circulatory issues, you
    could also add remedies like Atropinum and Placenta and see if then the
    measurements become easier.

Heavy Metals

Satya OrionSatya Orion
April 2015 edited April 2015 in Toxins Flag
Client:
Me

Chiren sessions:
Many, but the Nervous System never dropped until now.

Most recent measurement:
Nervous System + Large Intestine => balanced by many heavy metals 
Kidneys are still not balanced => the main remedies I have been using for the
Kidneys are both types of Staph and Intestinal Flora. 

My reasoning:
I am assuming this toxicity was causing endorphins in the Nervous system. 
It may be the underlying cause of the relentless tinnitus I have been
suffering, so I am eager to treat this.
I suspect the Kidneys have been held back by the Large Intestine, which is also
being affected by heavy metals. 

I have learned that it is not a good idea to treat for heavy metals until the
Kidneys are balanced at the beginning of a session. 

Questions:
1. Given these circumstances, would it be safe to use a few heavy metal
remedies (Plumbum, Cuprum) in order to balance the Large Intestine?

2. How many heavy metals could safely be used?

3. Generally do all heavy metals need to be cleared via remedies, or can the
body do some of this on its own?

    Two things are very unlikely:
    A. If you experience a sudden drop on the Nervous System meridian, it is
    unlikely that it is caused by heavy metals. And especially not by "many
    heavy metals".
    B. It is equally unlikely that many heavy metals are causing the Large
    Intestine meridian to show disturbances. 
   
    Plumbum:
    The only rare possible heavy metal that can be found on the Large Intestine
    meridian is Plumbum, but then the symptoms should match and you should also
    experience either diarrhoea or constipation. Diarrhoea is in that case
    caused by poisoning by inorganic lead, but this hardly appears anymore.
    Organic lead is more common and causes constipation. 

    Acute Nervous System Drops:
    These acute drops on the Nervous System are far more likely caused by
    something like Botulism, Rubella or Variolinum. Or by toxins like Dioxin or
    Formaldehyde. Heavy metals are the last thing I would try in this case.
    Botulism would also affect the Large Intestine. Depending on the side of
    the body where you measure drops on the Large Intestine, I would select
    most likely remedies. 

    Heavy Metals
    If you have used heavy metal remedies in the past, it would not be found in
    measurement again unless the body has had a current exposure to heavy
    metals again. This can be the case if there is continuous ingestion of
    heavy metals. 
    Copper may come from copper pipes in your water supply
    Aluminium may come from the water too or from aluminium cooking ware or
    deodorants

    Tinnitus:
    Tinnitus is caused by physical pressure in the ear passages. In case of any
    form of stress, the ear passage cramps and the pressure becomes worse, so
    the tinnitus becomes worse. This has nothing to do with the Nervous
    System. The increased pressure is caused by a narrowing at some location in
    the ear passage. It can be caused by stress or by a blockage of mucous or a
    polyp or anything else.

    Suggestions:
    So given the situation that you have presented, I would not use heavy
    metals. 
    In any case I would use only one heavy metal at the time. Only then can you
    possibly identify the probable cause. It is unlikely that "many metals" are
    needed at the same time.
    Also, do not look at the heavy metals or the Nervous System for solving
    your tinnitus. You need to find what causes the increased pressure.

    Johan, thank you very much for your reply and suggestions!.
   
    In my session today, the only meridians still dropping are:
   
    Large Intestine (L) - all points
    Nervous System (L) - all points
   
    Plumbum:
   
    Yes, I have been experiencing constipation. Plumbum is still correcting
    drops on both meridians.
   
    Large Intestine:
   
    Is still asking for all 4 Intestinal Flora. 
   
    Acute Nervous System Drops:
   
    Yes, Formaldehyde is showing as a cause, but still I am measuring Plumbum
    and Cuprum also.
    Negative to Botulism, Rubella, Variolinum.
   
    Heavy Metals:
   
    I have treated with Cuprum and Plumbum in the past, and do suspect the
    water pipes are a continuous problem.
   
    I have a Berkey drinking water filter which is great.  But there is still
    the shower and water I use for cooking.
    The filters I was using for these only take out Chlorine.   I have started
    using the Berkey water for cooking and just purchased a better shower
    filter.  So I will see if this makes a difference.
   
    Tinnitus:
   
    Thank you for clarifying this.
   
    The Tinnitus has been a real puzzle for me, as sometimes it is gone
    completely.  I have noticed it is made worse by exposure to electromagnetic
    fields, which does cause stress on this body and pressure.  I was thinking
    about metals in this instance as I have read your theories that metals may
    act like an antenna in the body.
   
    Sitting or lying down also can make it worse, which I always thought had to
    do with Lymphatic slowdown/pressure. I have successfully treated a Chronic
    Staph/Strep infection, which has helped considerably with this.
   
    I have treated with both Polyps remedies in the past, with also slight
    improvement in symptoms.
   
    It seems there are several different areas causing pressure.

Treating the Terrain

As we know, If the terrain isnt healthy the body doesn't heal. I use mucosa
often... what other remedies are the best to heal the terrain of the body?

    Depends on what's going on.

    I consider the whole body the Terrain. All functions of the body must be
    corrected. And where does the body start to heal?

    1st step: you need to get the walls of the castle closed again, so that no
    more invaders can enter. The walls of the body are the Aura and the Triple
    Warmer.

    2nd step: the Kidneys, Bladder and Lymphatics must be in good condition, so
    that all garbage can be immediately moved outside the castle.

    3rd step: the Circulation must come in order, together with the Intestines.
    (You might need Gallbladder in order to get Circulation and Intestines
    right.)

    4th step: the Gallbladder must come in order. (You might need Liver
    remedies to get the Gallbladder in order, but take care not to use Liver
    nosodes too soon)

    And so on. I suggest you do one or two organs at the same time. But no
    more. Key is to focus. 

    Mucosa is a remedy for the mucous membranes. If the cause has been removed,
    then Mucosa can help heal the mucous membranes. But it is a Supportive
    Remedy… not a Nosode. The Nosodes are the Remedies you need to use in order
    to get the body back to the situation where it can self-heal again.

    Yes, detox pathways really need to be working, my goodness gallbladder/
    liver/ etc. 

    Question:
    1. Should perhaps the autonomic nervous system really be right up there
    with the Hormone System?

    2. I've got a cyst inside of my Liver, and drops on my Liver can be lifted
    with the Lyme Nosode, but it doesn't hold. 
    Is this because the bugs are inside of the cyst packet and aren't being
    effected?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    January 2014 edited January 2014 Flag
    Answer:
    1. No, the disturbances in the Nervous System are caused by disturbances in
    other Organ Systems. This system is dependent on the overall detox ability
    of the body. It is definitely not a good idea to focus on the Nervous
    System early on in treatment. Especially because it might lead you to use
    Heavy Metals before the exit channels are corrected.

    2. If there's a Liver cyst (circulatory problem), this is what you should
    treat, by for example treating with Ovarian Cyst and improving Circulation/
    Energy.

    Energy improvement => Intestinal health (Flora!), Adrenals, Liver (make
     sure these systems are treated when necessary)

    Lyme is not the Remedy you should focus on at all. It is not going to solve
    anything. In case of actual Lyme disease it can only be seen as supportive
    and not as real problem solver. I never use it myself anymore, since I
    haven't seen a positive or crucial effect from it in getting clients with
    chronic Lyme back on their feet.

    Question:
    For clarification: for example if the focus of treatment are the Intestines
    and you have balanced them along with detox organs on the hand treatment
    with say 5 nosodes.  And this of course cross matches on other Organ
    Systems so for the remaining 3 slots in the hand treatment do we not
    continue with the protocol and address the remaining drops (which are
    usually the yin organs) or do we stop with this, leave the rest of the
    slots blank and add support on the footplates for the balanced organs?

    I hope the question is clear.

    Question:
    Do you have any recommendations for real problem solvers with Lyme?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    January 2014 edited October 2015 Flag
    Kavita: If you for example balance the Intestines with 5 Nosodes, you put
    in 3 Supports for those organs.
    On the Footplates you put in additional Support for the Intestines, Stomach
    or Jaw, or other Yang Organs. Support for the specific problem e.g.
    Inflammation in general (because you found inflammation in the Intestines)
    can also be given.
    But you leave the Yin Organs alone, apart from the Kidneys if needed. Only
    when the Yang Organs are OK you start to treat the Yin Organs.

    Daphna: It is hard to give you more than general advise since you don't
    give information (measurements, difficulties etc.) about a specific Lyme
    case you are struggling with.
    I do understand everyone wants recipes, but this is the way to address Lyme
    and any other disease:

    " 1st step: you need to get the walls of the castle closed again, so that
    no more invaders can enter. The walls of the body are the Aura and the
    Triple Warmer.

    2nd step: the Kidneys, Bladder and Lymphatics must be in good condition, so

    Liver nosodes too soon)

    And so on. I suggest you do one or two organs at the same time. But no
    more. Key is to focus."
   
    I have not seen one person with "Lyme", that is the same although Trauma
    and a history of being Abused seems to be a factor in initiating the
    Symptoms. It seems to me there is the same illusion surrounding Lyme, that
    surrounded (and still does) AIDS and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in that it is
    blamed on the opportunists (bugs). But the Cause is an underlying Systemic
    problem.
    Ultimately you need to just find the specific causes of the Immune Failure
     of your client, and get the overall balance restored so the body starts
    healing itself again.

    Don't forget about Lifestyle (boundaries, stress, not following ones own
    heart, drugs etc.) and Environmental Causes (EMF is a big one!), when you
    don't find any progress. Stress factors can work against the healing
    response you try to initiate.

    Question:
    Regarding Step 1. In my notes I have that one should not treat the aura
    with Ozaliet until the end of treatments because it can suppress symptoms.
    Please straighten me out!
  •

    Sometimes when we first begin with Biontology, our minds get set on
    "fixing" the symptoms and a Drs. diagnosis, as this is how we have been
    trained to think and correct things in life (which is really only a
    cover-up and will eventually cause more issues - you see it all around us).

    Even with Lyme or cancer for instance; when first introduce to Biontology,
    and Johan would say "look for the cause", my thoughts would go to thinking
    of which bacteria or what kind of cancer is "causing the disease". 

    Now I understand it differently, as he says with the "terrain not being
    healthy" in the first place, we then are vulnerable to negative influences
    around us; whether it be Lyme, cancer, EMF, etc., etc., etc.......(you can
    name any disease in there or multiple diseases if ignored a long time).
    Each person will attract a different negative influence that is attracted
    to the "unhealthy terrain". When a group of people are all exposed to the
    same negative influence, the reason some bodies accept the disturbance and
    why others get no symptoms, has to do with the healthy or unhealthy terrain
    (whether it is physical or emotional terrain). So then the "cause" that the
    bacteria was attracted to and the body would then accept the Lyme
    bacterias, for example, might be EMF sensitivity BECAUSE OF lack of a large
    enough aura or a hole in the aura (which must be strengthened or the
    disturbance continues to disturb) , vaccinations, emotional disturbances in
    their life, and many other causative possibilities. 

    So you must first focus on treating the identified "cause", while giving a
    nosode for the symptoms of Lyme or cancer, for instance, and then in the
    footplates give supports for the causal factor, while also giving some
    support for the identified symptom (example Lyme, cancer) and also give
    support to enforce the health and drainage of the Yang organs to keep it
    moving out.

    Just keep working at it (reading, treating and research) and it will
    eventually come to you and you will get that "now I get it" moment and you
    will cross over to "knowing" as Johan says.

    Jiri:
    The answer is in your Assessment. When you Measure that there's an Aura
    problem, this will show in steep drops especially on the Triple Warmer
    Meridian. Since in your protocol you need to address the Triple Warmer
    first, of course you can use Ozaliet when you measure it… Ozaliet by the
    way is not a Flower Remedy and also not a Compositum with a generalistic,
    low potency combination of homeopathic remedies. It is actually very
    powerful in Strengthening the Aura and thus sometimes needed as a Causal
    Remedy. 
   
    The problem lies in the fact that people were giving random recipes before
    having measured anything, and this does mask crucial Information. 
    If you really want to give some general Aura Support in your treatment,
    safe that as part of the Supports on the Footplate treatment.

    But "fixing" the Aura is not just as simple as using one Remedy. It has to
    do with the overall Energy of the body, Environmental Factors (e.g. EMF)
    and also with psychological factors like putting up Boundaries, Self
    Awareness and being Centred/Grounded. 
    Again Synthesis Thinking needs to be applied.

    Ronda:
    Thank you! I'm very happy that things start to make sense for you. It is a
    challenging process to get from linear thinking to Synthesis Thinking, and
    it is also very hard to teach. So it is good to hear you are so invested in
    your learning curve and are taking the steps to go beyond your old hang-ups
    ;-)

    The age of the baby does not make any difference, even it is
    premature. Follow the same procedure with extreme care. Check with the
    mother if the baby has had vaccinations/medication in her very short life.
    They are getting crazier every time with vaccinating young children...

    For tips I should know what symptoms the baby has. And one should know what
    problems the mother has/had that lead to the premature birth. The same
    problems might exist in the baby,

Myristica Sebifera

JohJoh
February 2013 edited February 2014 in Dental Problems/Solutions Flag
Have been treating myself with Myristica Sebifera and feel it will mean I can
save a Tooth…

Dental History:
I have a number of Root Canals 
History of Teeth Trouble. 
TMJ

Symptoms:
Recent toothache

Measurement & Treatment:
Stomach channel => Myristica Sebifera => I have taken it ( on the rods ) 4
times over a few weeks. 

Response:
* Really felt the remedy working => tooth has got better => no longer reacts to
cold, no longer inflamed, feels much more stable in my mouth. 
* The whole right side of my mouth reacted => really intense pain, taste of
metal all the time, alternation between throbbing of the whole right jaw and
calmness, sometimes the pain radiates out to the top of my ear (never had this
before)

Actions taken:
* Drinking lots and lots of water => helped
* "Oil pulling" with Sesame oil => was a real relief!
* Eating lots of food => also helped… 

Warning!
Although Mysterica is obviously a great remedy, if you use this remedy on a
client for a boil anywhere in the body it may affect the Teeth, when he/she has
dental issues. This can give your client a lot of discomfort as my experience
shows. 
So please use with caution or the correct support. 

Question:
What remedies would you suggest to help the Interstitial Fluid detoxify, while
using Myristica Sebifera?

Comments

  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    February 2013 edited February 2014 Flag
    1) Myristica Sebifera is not a Nosode but a Support Remedy and I would
    suggest to also treat with the Dental Nosodes Kieferostitis and Granuloma
    Denti (measure for it, probably you need both!).
    Lymphomyosot and Belladonna are good supports.
   
    2) In acute situations it is helpful to get the homeopathic remedy (drops/
    pellets). You need to take the remedy in this situation several times a
    day, but you can't treat yourself several times a day with the Chiren!
    You're not healthy/clean and every treatment starts a new detoxification.
    This would overburden your body with toxins. So the only way to expose
    yourself to the remedy several times a day is to take it in the form of
    homeopathic pellets or drops.

    The advise to take homeopathic remedies, instead of the whole (systemic)
    Chiren treatment, is only for acute situations.
   
    3) Treating a client for a boil would be symptom treatment and not
    Biontology. 
    When there are dental problems this is always a very important issue to
    address and to focus on. Nobody gets dental discomfort from a remedy if
    there's no problem to begin with and that issue has to be dealt with first
    for the body to be able to heal completely. Trying to get rid of a boil in
    a situation of severe dental problems sounds a bit strange to me anyway, so
    that wouldn't happen in practice when you follow protocol. Teeth problems
    can be one of the core issues of bad health.

    In your case with the teeth I would test for 
    Kieferostitis (for Jaw infections) on the stomach meridian to look for the
    Cause. 

    of Support as you ask for I suggest:
    Belladonna.  Echinacea is included in Belladonna remedie. A good remedie
    with high potency of both ingrediences.

    Aesculus if the pus leaves too much toxins in the blood.
    I would test for Mercuriusheel as a remedie for Furuncles, even if it is
    not directly relevant. 
    Lymphomyosot can be used by infections to ease the lymphatic system. 
    Pulsantilla Comp if the Pus/ the bacterias from the tooth is a problem to
    the connective tissue. 
    Arnica is good when working on local infections. 

    Check the need for Kidney support to extract bacterias from the body,
    (Solidago is one)

    even our  Adrenal Glands favorites remedies can be of good support :
    Selenium and Berbeis can be good support but has nothing to do with the
    cause in this case.... 

    This is my recommondation of support but mark that I always measure to see
    if there is a match, so this is no recepie but an advice.

others is really on that card?

2. Please explain how to send a remedy to someone else by email.

and remedies, so that I do not lose any valuable information in the event that
the Chiren gets damaged?

    Answers:

    1. The only way to test if a remedy is on the card is to try out the card
    as remedy. If you program the card, you type a name on it. Then you load
    the remedies onto the card. If you have done this, you can put the card in
    the Chiren and click on " read". If the name that you typed in then appears
    in your own remedy section, the card is OK. Afterwards you can delete the
    remedy again from your Chiren.

    2. It is a very elaborate process. And one must use only one file per CD
    and per card and per email.
    Sending remedies by email:
    1 Take a new CD and write a name onto it in a word file. 
    2 Put the CD on a footplate connected to the output of the Chiren. 
    3 Choose a remedy from the Chiren and put it in one of the slots. 
    4 Run the remedies program. 
    5 Upload the file that is on the CD into your computer and send it as an
    attachment to an email recipient.
    The email recipient needs to:
    1 Copy the file onto a CD. 
    2 Create a card on which he/she needs to type the name of the remedy. 
    3 Copy the file from the CD onto the card using the remedies program.
    4 Loads the card into the Chiren. 

    3. Files from your Chiren can only be copied onto cards. Each client file
    can be copied onto a separate card which then can be used on any Chiren.
    One can also use a USB drive. Go to System Setup, then System, then Export.
    This will accumulate all data on the USB drive.

    I recently backed up some of my own remedies onto cards.  When I made my
    first card I realized immediately afterwards that I forgot to put the
    remedy into the green slot.  Therefore the card only had the name on it and
    no remedy. 

    I thought i would do an experiment and see what would happen if I tried to
    read that card in my Chiren and it did accept the card.  Of course, I
    immediately deleted it because I knew that there was only a name and no
    remedy associated with it.

    Therefore it appears, to me, that there may not be any way to verify if a
    card we receive actually has a remedy on it.

    Yes that is what I meant with, the only way to know whether the remedy is
    on there is "to try out the card as a remedy". When the card is not
    effective, you will notice this in its lack of effectiveness (the same way
    we noticed that it was still necessary to put Chikey cards on the
    footplates to load the remedies).

    The only thing you can test is whether you have put the name on the card
    and if it is working "technically".

    I can see that my explanation might have been unclear.

    Thank you for the clarification. 

    It appears that:

    1. If the remedy from the card matches during measurement then we know the
    remedy is on card.
    2. If symptoms improve we know the remedy MIGHT be on the card.  This is
    because we can't be sure that it wasn't another remedy given during the
    same treatment that created the result. 

    If the card does not fix the drops or eliminate symptoms:
    1. The card may have been named but no remedy was installed.
    2. The remedy was on the card but it is not a match for the particular
    clients that it was tested on.

    Therefore it may be difficult to always know, for sure, if a card has a
    remedy properly installed. And a certain amount of trust is needed in the
    competence of the person creating the cards.

    Yes! Very well explained. 

    It is just a matter of keeping your attention fully with what you are doing
    when loading cards, and then you will know for sure you have loaded the
    remedy. ;-)

Emphysema - Bronchial Attack after Treatment

DennisOwensDennisOwens
October 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
67 Yr Male diagnosed with emphysema around year 2000. Has been bedridden for
nearly 5 years. Lies in bed all day with 24 hr. caretakers around. Watches big
screen TV at the foot of his hospital style bed. 

After second treatment, Client reported that later that evening he began
coughing up a lot of mucous and felt like he couldn't breathe.
He called a doctor who administered some antibiotic and predisone.

Client wants to continue biophoton treatment but doesn't want to re-experience
the frightening coughing, gasping attack.

History:
Suffered verbal and physical abuse as a child at the hands of his parents. 

Symptoms:
Very thin and boney
Very little muscle tissue. 
Dark patches on varied areas of skin.
Very alert but often in states of fantasy.
Panic attacks (when thinking lost love many years ago => abandonment issues)
Considers himself to be an enlightened being (Participated in a number of
spiritual rituals) 
Watches mostly religious programming.
Feels guilty about never having earned much money, and lives off of a large
inheritance.

Supplements/Medication:
Oxygen sometimes 
Albuterol and Advair.
Drinks 3-4 cups of marijuana tea per day. 
Heavy Smoker -both cigarettes and marijuana for many years.

Measurement and Treatment:
Although his alertness is good, his physical energy level is so low it is
difficult to trust the low volume readings I have taken.
It appears that most points are dropping. 
Tested remedies showed some improvement- many still dropping but slower.

ADVICE REQUESTED
I would like some advice as to how to boost his energy so that the quality of
the readings are in fact accurate 
and how best to proceed to prevent any future attacks.
As a green practitioner, this feels challenging, so any advice or experience
on reversing emphysema would be greatly appreciated..

    Hi Dennis,

    This is Barbara from Oregon writing. Interesting case. 

    A comment and a question.
    1) I notice you have used Bach/Bush in standard treatment hand rods. I
    think those can be done later after standard treatment and footplates in a
    short program with the hand rods.
    2) Which nosodes did you test against the lungs and large intestines?

    This is a great client for you to learn on. 
    Good luck.

    Hi Barbara,

    I have to admit the client was talking a lot and a bit distracting and I
    felt a bit nervous about how to proceed due to the very low volume of the
    measurements. Although I recorded which remedies I used, my notes are a bit
    sketchy so I'm not exactly sure what remedies cleared which points. I was
    mostly working on the triple warmer but believe that bronchialis,
    pertussis, and Insecticides were used on the Lungs and /or Large Intestine.
    Thanks for the advice about the Bach/Bush remedies.

    I am seeing him tomorrow and will be more conscientious about my note
    taking. 

    Many thanks for your interest and input.

    Hi Dennis,

    Thank you for this very interesting case, but a very difficult one.

    Difficult because there are circumstance that you probably can't change
    that might need to be changed to have results.

    * A weak person like your client will almost for sure be in Spin-Inversion
    all the time because of the electrical (or metal hospital) bed he is in.
    Even if you correct his Spin-Inversion and give him energy remedies, he
    will most likely get back into the Spin-Inversion immediately, allowing the
    body no time to actually act on the remedies (=create more energy). 
    * When you treat a client who is in Spin-Inversion without correcting it
    first, this can actually cause the situation to aggravate. This might be
    what happened the second session, because I don't see you have treated Spin
    Inversion there. 
    * But another thing that might be causative of his reaction is actually a
    "good" thing, that not always is recognized as such. Namely, the
    suppression being gone and the body starting to rid itself of garbage =
    mucous. Creating and expelling mucous is the way of the Lungs to rid them
    of things that don't belong...
    Viscum was only used the second session, and this remedy is exactly what
    was needed to lift the suppression and restore the Pituitary from the
    effect of the Marihuana.
    * Another problem: Lifting suppression might not exactly be what your
    client is looking for, since his whole life was about survival and running
    away from his feelings. (marihuana, spiritual escapist pursuits
    (un-embodied spirituality, watching TV)  When someone has created an
    alternative self (enlightened being) that makes life just bearable, being
    forced back into the body might not really be what is wished for. 
    * The "spiritual aspect" of the Metal element (Lungs + Large Intestines) is
    the "corporal soul", and this element has to do with physical survival,
    embodiment, boundaries, the ability to digest emotions and let them go and
    autonomic regulation of the body. All these aspects are naturally affected
    by the abuse, and hence the physical lung is also affected by this. He
    might not be willing or able to face all this... especially since he feels
    he is enlightened. It has to remain his own choice.
    * Marihuana blocks the Pituitary gland and thereby the ability of the body
    to self-heal. As long as he uses this keep treating him with Viscum to undo
    this harm. Every time he takes marihuana he should be treated with Viscum
    again. If there's an unwillingness to let go of Marihuana this would be the
    best way (using a Chikey with only Viscum on there might be helpful). But
    don't forget that when he actually is in Spin Inversion this might not be a
    good idea at all.
    * When both Lungs and Large Intestines show drops Tuberculinum can be
    helpful, also for the emotional aspect.
    * Adrenals always are part of Emphysema. So they should always be carefully
    watched and addressed if you continue your treatment.
    Potassium salt has shown to be helpful for Emphysema too.

    It is a lot... So many aspects involved. 
    You have to make the decision together with your client whether to proceed
    with further treatments or not.
    Sometimes it is also needed to admit that the situation is not workable.

AlexandraAlexandra
November 2015 edited November 2015 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
Woman, Age 58. Her next appointment is in 1 week

No Tonsil problems as a child (or in the past years) => still has her Tonsils
6 years old => possible repressed abuse by stepfather=> revealed in a "
family-constellation" session, but she does not remember this
Single for a long time now

more hot, a bit melancholic".
2 years ago => headaches began => tried many therapies
few month ago => gums started bleeding
1 month ago => lost her job
1 month ago => Bladder infection (not a present or recurrent symptom) =>
resolved by colloidal silver, no antibiotics taken

Symptoms:
Headaches => heavy and frequent => starts in shoulder, then moves up on both
sides of the occiput (Gallbladder meridian) => pain on the inner point of the
eyebrow (Bladder meridian) and the outer point of the eyebrow (Stomach
meridian?)
Bleeding gums
Nausea => after eating things with too much cream, too much sweets, sweet
fruits
Cold feet => always
„Very little tinitus“

Psychological Symptoms:
Angry with herself, because of job loss
Afraid of what the future might bring her => financial problems? no job or
relationship?

Strong need to talk => extremely talkative
Problems with "trusting men" => but fed up with being alone

1st Session

Measurement:
Pituitary gland
Adrenal glands

6 Spin Inversion points:
No drops

Whiplash Treatment => No headache anymore

1st Measurement:
Adrenal glands => Selenium (but also used Berberis in the footplate treatment)

Note: Almost no sound on the point that dropped on the Lungs and on the
Lymphatic system. I found no matching remedy.

>12 yrs Program:

Bact Coli, Bact Lactis

„Safed“ for later:
Hamamelis (Veins), Selenium, Berberis (Adrenals)

Footplate Treatment:
Hamamelis (Veins), Selenium, Berberis, Ovarium, Populus, Solidago, Thalamus,
Viscum

3rd Measurement:
No Drops.

Treatment Results:
No Headache anymore

Comments:
After reading the post „Why protocol is important“ I’m even more careful with
treating and always try to follow protocol as close as possible. But with this
case in mind and following the protocol I had the feeling of treating with a
"handbrake" and not having enough done. I ignored almost all drops beside the
one on the Hormon System and Kidneys.

I am not an experienced practitioner and always question my measuring, but
especially with this woman I had problems to bring Symptoms, measurement and
treatment in a logical line.

Questions
1. Is the described session considered correct treatment?

2. I am aware, that I did not use enough Nosodes. But according to protocol I
first have to correct and support the Hormon System and Kidneys and then
Circulation before I treat the next layer. And for Circulation are almost only
support remedies are suggested. Is this understanding of the protocol correct?

3. I guess her bleeding gums and nausea are connected with the Stomach
meridian. Kieferostitis corrected the drop on the Stomach meridian but,
although I was tempted, I did not put it in the slot because I thought it would
be safer and better to wait with addressing the Stomach meridian until the 2nd
Session. Was I to careful in this case? I know that only when a client has Jaw
/ Gum issues the Stomach meridian can be addressed early...

4. Bacterium Proteus corrected the Kidney Point. Is is correct to add all other
4 Bacterias? They can then be seen as Nosodes. Correct? So I have used 6
Nosodes and 2 Support Remedies in the 1st Session.

5. If Selenium fits in the first measurement for the Adrenals (and Hamamelis
for the Veins). Is it correct to „save“ the slots for as much Nosodes as
possible and put the Support for later on the Footplates?

6. After the first treatment, there were almost no drops anymore. Although I
did not adress many meridians / Organ systems. Do you see this as a measurement
problem? I tried hard and searched for points but almost no drops..

7. I expected the Gallbladder to have drops (because oft he strong headache)
But there where no Drops..?

8. According to protocol the Circulation is one of the meridian that can be
adressed in the first (when Hormone System and kidneys are ok) or second
session. The first Remedy to try is (Measurement Protocol) Barijodeel. When
this matches, can Barijodeel (with Aurumheel) really be used in the first
session? I read in one post that one has to be careful with Calcification 

Greatful for comments in this case

    I do not understand the very first measurement before you gave Whiplash
    treatment. I only see drops on the Hormone System. Is this the only system
    you measured at that point? And then you say that there were no drops on
    any of the 6 Spin Inversion points, but the Pituitary did drop? 

    Answers
    1. Contrary to how you feel about it, your session was perfect. You treated
    the Hormone System together with the Intestinal Flora for the Kidneys. No
    more nosodes were necessary in this session. Ignoring the rest of the drops
    was a good decision. The fact that the Whiplash treatment removed the
    headache was also a good sign. Possibly it was a big causal factor.

    2. Because the biggest problem on the Circulation/Veins is usually
    calcification, and there is no use in treating it until Hormonal System is
    corrected, you best leave it for now.
    If he Hormonal System, especially the Parathyroid is correct in the first
    measurement of the next session, you might try the Circulation remedies if
    nothing else takes priority.  

    3. The bleeding gums are definitely a Stomach issue. It was good to wait
    with using nosodes for this system.

    4. It was correct to use all 4 Bacterial Flora nosodes in this case. You
    measured the Bact. Proteus, then it is logical that the other bacteria must
    be somewhere outside the Intestines as well.

    5. Selenium matched on the Adrenals, and you should use this remedy in the
    hand treatment. Because it was a measured remedy you should. There is no
    need to save it. I would have used Berberis as well in the first part of
    the session, instead of Atropinum. Klimaktheel was obviously the wrong
    remedy because the point still dropped after the treatment
    Klimaktheel was clearly a remedy that is intended to treat a symptom, too
    early. The causes have not been addressed as yet.

    6. No, I do not think you have a measurement problem. It seemed a logical
    sequence that almost no points were dropping anymore. I would not have
    expected much else.

    7. I also would have expected the Gallbladder to drop. Not because of the
    headache (which could also have been caused by the Whiplash or the Stomach
    or Bladder meridian), but because of her talkative behaviour and her
    anger. These are typical symptoms for Gallbladder and Liver problems.
    Did you measure the Gallbladder before you gave the Whiplash treatment? The
    Whiplash treatment may also have corrected Gallbladder drops. 

    8. The remedies Barijodeel and Aurumheel can not be used in the first
    session, because they are for hardening of the Arteries. The Calcium
    metabolism (Parathyroid) must be right first as well as the Pituitary
    gland.

    I first measured on both hands the Hormonal System: Pituitary, Adrenal
    glands, Pineal gland, Thyroid and Sex glands dropped. 
    Before I treated Whiplash, I measured if the Spin-Inversion Points on the
    Heart and Circulation Meridian drop. This was not the case. Without
    measuring any further points, I treated Whiplash (Answer 7)
   
    Reaction to Answer
    7. Yes, I treated Whiplash before measuring Gallbladder and probably lost
    information. Good learning! I will not do that again.


    2nd Session

    Changes in Symptoms:
    Headache => one week without (unusual!) => started again right before this
    session => but "different than usual" => chewing gum helps
    Energy => very good this week
    Intestine => good bowel movement (normally more dry) => very smelly
    Urine => very yellow and smelly
    Sweating a lot => also smelly (normally she never smells) => sensitive
    about the smell, but understands it to be a positive reaction of the body
    because she also experiences positive energy

    New Information (remembered during treatment):
    Course of events that preceded the start of the headache, two years ago:
    Difficult job situation => felt repressed aggression and rage => felt "let
    down" by employer => broke right little toe at work => quit her job =>
    regretted decision 

    1st Measurement
    Adrenal glands => Selenium
    Large Intestine (R) - 2 points => Tuberculinum, Appendicitis, Chronic
    Appendicitis  (Point 3 and 5 distal) 
    Arteries (R) - 1 point => Barijodeel    ( Point 3 distal (Aorta
    Abdominalis, right?)
    Sex glands => Ovarial Cyst

    >12 yrs. Program
    Selenium, Tuberculinum (Large Intestine point 3 distal), Chronic
    Appendicitis (Appendix point), Appendicitis (Appendix point), Barijodeel
    (Arteries), Aurumheel, Ovarial Cyst (sex glands)

    2nd Measurement
    Bladder (R) - Bladder Body (Point 5 distal), Sex Organ  

    Footplates
    Myom Uteri, Metro-Adnex, Berberis, Solidago, Populus, Nux vomica,
    Podophylum, Spascupreel

    3rd Measurement
    No Drops

    3rd Treatment
    Whiplash

    Treatment result:
    Only little Headache when she left


    Note: I was very surprised and could not believe that I didn’t find more
    points dropping. 
    I measured and treated and searched for almost three hours but couldn’t
    find more. 
    No drops on any meridian on the feet?! She used no foot cream. Normal skin.
    Kidneys were very hard to measure last time. Almost no sound. This time
    very good and clear sound, no drop.

    Questions
    1. Barijodeel matched on Arteries. Is it ok to put it in in the 2nd session
    together with Aurumheel or still too early?

    2. I seem to have problems to clear her Sex glands. Last time Klimaktheel
    matched, but the point still dropped after first treatement. Now Ovarial
    Cyst matched. But still drop after Hand Treatement. Then Myom Uteri
    matched..? That makes no sense, right?

    3. I tried all suggested nosodes in the protocol for the Bladder => no
    match. Then I decided to only give support. Was that correct?

    4. What could be the reason that the Bladder drops after the Hand
    Treatement
   
    5. I don’t understand why I don’t find drops on the feet, specially on the
    Gallbladder meridian. Any advice what I am doing wrong?

    6. I did not measure Spascupreel but thought it could be helpful against
    the tension in her shoulder and head. Now while overlooking my treatement I
    regret that I used it because I realise that Spascupreel is a Support for
    the Gallbladder which 1. shows no drops and 2. is to early to treat.
    Spascupreel as a support remedy for Gallbladder does not help but can mask
    underlying Gallbladder problems. Is that correct thinking?

    Next appointment in 8 days

    Hi Alexandra,

    Just to make things more clear, I need to understand the following:

    When you write: "point 3 distal", does this mean that you started counting
    from the most proximal point and then arrived at a relatively distal point?
    If not so I do not see how you arrived at the Aorta Abdominalis point on
    the Circulation meridian by counting 3. If you were to start distal, at the
    nail point, it would be the 4th point.

    Also the Appendix point would be the 6th point if you started counting at
    the most proximal point, but for the Large Intestine (R) you wrote: "point
    3 and 5 distal"

    Thank you

    1. Because the Pituitary and Parathyroid are balanced now, it is OK to use
    Barijodeel/Aurumheel at this stage.

    2. Klimaktheel is a support remedy and when there is a real problem with
    the Sex Glands/Organs it will not solve the problem, so it is not really
    surprising that the Sex Gland point dropped again this session.

    If Ovarial Cyst or Myom Uteri matches on the Sex Gland (Hormonal function)
    point, it should also match on the Ovaries (Sex Organ point) themselves.
    But, normally it is difficult to measure the Bladder meridian because of
    the callus, especially in women.

    Ovarial Cyst did not correct the point, but Myom Uteri did, so the first
    measurement was not right (false positive). Next time you can see if your
    treatment was effective and the point corrected permanently. If there is,
    however, a physically manifested uterine fibroid, you may measure Myom
    Uteri several times.

    3. It will not do any harm to use only Bladder supports, but I doubt if it
    will have any effect, because this way the cause is not addressed. But I
    also do not see that you supported the Bladder meridian, apart from the Sex
    Organ point (Metro-Adnex).
    You did use Kidney supports, and this was a good choice, because are
    clearly not ok as yet, considering the "smells", urine and skin reactions.

    A Sex Organ issue can affect the whole Bladder meridian. So when there are
    more Bladder points that drop, and the cause is the Ovaries, then the
    remedy that corrects the Sex Organ point may also correct the other Bladder
    drops. In this case the Sex Organ point was corrected, but there was still
    a drop on the Bladder body...

    The 1st Session Bacterium Proteus corrected both Bladder and Kidneys, and
    the usual underlying cause of this is (a stage of) Appendicitis, which you
    only found the next session... Because of the Appendicitis, it is very
    likely that the Bladder drop is still an Intestinal Flora infection. Did
    you try to use the 4 Bacteria (instead of one by one) all together in
    measurement?

    4. The treatment always has a relaxing effect. Therefore possibly this
    relaxation is the cause of the suddenly dropping point. But the Bladder
    nail point is also difficult to measure often because of callus.

    5. Looking at her history and present symptoms there must be drops on the
    Gallbladder meridian. You mention that she is sweating a lot, which can
    influence the measurement. Maybe this was a problem?
    The excessive sweating and foul smelling body odour also show that there is
    still a Kidney problem. So the Kidneys should have drops also. It may be
    suppression, but I do not think so, because drops could be measured on the
    Kidneys and even the Liver during the previous session.

    6. It is not a problem to treat with Spascupreel (or Atropinum)
    symptomatically. It has a general relaxing effect, that will not be strong
    enough to disturb the measurements until the next session. When you put
    this support in the Footplate Treatment, after you have corrected all the
    points of focus with remedies that were measured, it will also not mask
    important information (drops).

    Thank you so much Karolina & Johan!

    Karolina:

    * Probably I have an old Chiren Version or missed to do an Update? On my
    screen I see 5 Points on all Meridians on the Hand (Lungs & Lymphatic 3
    Points) But I’ve seen in the Manual that there should be 6 Points

    * I always start counting proximal (on the Point most close to the Hand).
    What is better for you if you overlook the Treatement?


    Johan's Answers:

    3. I read in one of your Posts that it is wrong to see certain body
    reactions as „Detoxification“ and I’m now much more aware that
    uncomfortable Symptoms should not be considered as positive reaction. But:
    if the Body (Kidney/ Intestines) excrete toxins, is it then not normal that
    the exrection is smelly. Do I have to see that as a „overload“ of the body
    /kidneys?

    I did not try to mesaure with all 4 Bacterias, only Bact Proteus. I will
    try next time if the Bladder drop again.

    I understand now how you arrive at 5 points and not at six. The Chiren
    pictures do not include the nail points. 
    Therefore it is best to use the pictures in the new manual.

    Counting from proximal to distal is OK, as long as you indicate it
    somewhere in the case presentation. For some points it is more relevant to
    know the specific connected tissue/organ than for others. For these points
    it is best to just use the name (gives the best oversight). They are:

    *All separate Hormone Glands
    *All separate points on the Lymphatic System
    *Appendix/Anus point (Large Intestine)
    *Meninges (Nervous System)
    *Sex Glands (Bladder)
    *Stone points (Kidney/Gallbladder)
    *Jaw (Stomach)

    Although there might be detoxification, most of the time the urine does not
    become very smelly. It might have a somewhat darker colour, but with the
    advised amount of water it should not be very dark. Sweating is also not a
    normal reaction to treatment.

    The fact that the body started to excrete a lot of foul smelling fluids
    through the Skin, indicates malfunction of the Kidneys or at least it means
    that the Kidney's capacity is insufficient for the amount of toxins. This
    means that the cause is either a Kidney problem or that the amount of
    toxins is very high, too much for the Kidneys. In any case it is advisable
    to support the Kidneys. One could support the Kidneys in every treatment
    because there is always a detox going on.
   
    So, indeed, these reactions should be considered an overload.

    Sweating and perspiration odor => gone => I never noticed it (but sensitive
    to it herself)
    Herpes genitalis => outbreak short after last session
    Lively Dreams
    Sexual feelings => increased => „more open“ in her pelvis area
    Energy => increased, „it flows better“
    Bowel movement => improved
    Possible Bladder infection (? her idea) => passing drops of urine after
    urination

    1st Measurement:
    Adrenals => Selenium (+Berberis) => Berberis on Footplate because I needed
    space for all 4 Bacterias
    Insulin Point (L+R) => Calculi Bil (still Drop) => Calculi Renales => ok =>
    but new Drop on Bladder (R)
    Sex Gland => Myom Uteri
    Kidney (L)
    Large Intestine (L) - 2 Points (also Anus)
    Large Intestine (R) - 3 Points (also Appendix)
    Small Intestine (L) - 1 Point
    Lymphatic System (L) - Nailpoint
    Bladder (L) - Sex Organ => Myom Uteri
    Bladder (R) - Body => drop after Calculi Bil + Renales in Slot => Bact
    Proteus (did not correct Point) => add Bact Pyo, Bact Coli, Bact Lactis =>
    ok
    Nervous System (L) - 2 Points (also Meninges)
    Nervous System (R) - 1 Point
    Lungs (L) - Nailpoint

    > 12 yrs. Program:
    Myom Uterri, Calculi Bil, Calculi Renales, Selenium, Bact Pyo, Bact
    Proteus, Bact Coli, Bact Lactis

    2nd Measurement:
    Nervous System (R) - Meninges => Herpes simplex
    Large Intestine (R) - 1 Point (Point 3 start counting distal)
    Adrenals => hardly any sound => Berberis (not much better. But what else to
    do?)
    Small Intestine (L) - 1 Point
    Lymphatic System (L) - Nailpoint
    Lungs (L) - Nailpoint

    Footplate Treatment:
    Herpes simplex, Solidago, Populus, Atropinum, Berberis, Metro-Adnex,
    Ovarium, Gynaecoheel

    3rd Measurement:
    Lymphatic System (L) - Nailpoint
    Lungs (L) - Nailpoint

    Questions
    1. How do you see the Herpes outbreak in context with the
    Biophoton-Treatement?

    2. She asked me if she can take a Spagyrik-Spray (TM4, TM8, D4, D2) from
    the pharmacy against Herpes. This helped her in the past, when she had the
    feeling that the Herpes could break out. I said No, because this is
    additional information. But I do not feel comfortable with that because I
    don’t now if the Chiren helps in a acute outbreak. Was it the right
    decision?

    3. I know I should not address the Nervous System before the Hormone
    System. What would be best to do in this situation?

    4. The Sex Gland dropped again.
    I am considering Johan's answer from the last session: „Next time you can
    see if your treatment was effective and the point corrected permanently. If
    there is, however, a physically manifested uterine fibroid, you may measure
    Myom Uteri several times.“

    5. Her symptoms are getting a bit better, but with regard to the treatment
    I see not much progress. Last time I addressed the Intestines but now I
    found more drops on the Hormone System and in general and I had to make one
    step back and even ignore drops on the Intestines. Any advice?

    6. After three sessions the Adrenals still drop => or almost no sound. What
    could be the reason for that? She is also easily stressed.

    7. Her feet are hard to measure: I hear hardly any sound. But there ar
    almost no drops on Gallbladder, Stomach, Liver! No sweating on feet, no
    cream, normal skin. I measured very carefully and the session took almost 3
    hours. What could be the reason for that?

    8. There were drops on both Insulin-Points:
    She is normal slim, no signs of diabetes. Before she came, she ate a big
    piece of cake => eats normally very healthy. Not to much sweets. Can this
    piece influence the Insulin-Points on a short term?

    9. We sceduled four appointments. But after three I have the feeing I’m
    still at the beginning and struggling with the Hormone System. I can not
    see if this is a normall process and a normal progress or if I’m on the
    wrong track. Grateful for more advise in this case.

    First of all: Whenever you measure Intestinal Flora anywhere outside the
    Large Intestine this is an indication of Appendicitis, especially if you
    measure the right Large Intestine including Appendix point... these are
    clear indications of Appendicitis Necroticans or at least Chronic
    Appendicitis, and you should have treated with these. 

    Answers
    1. Outbreaks of Herpes normally happen when the body cannot get rid of
    toxins because the Kidney function is insufficient. This happens also if
    there is over-treatment. It is in line with the excessive sweating she had
    before. So there is still an excretion problem/toxic overload.

    2. I agree with your decision to say no. It will only suppress this Herpes
    and do not solve everything. You are better off in that case to treat with
    Varicellen and Variolinum.

    3. Leave the Nervous System until the Yang organs are clean. It is not
    necessary to get all the points balanced, it is far more important to treat
    the Organ Systems in the correct sequence.

    4. Regarding the Sex Glands point, it is better to first correct the other
    Hormonal Glands.

    5. I don't believe the nosodes that you used for the Sex Glands (Myoma
    Uteri) and Insulin Points (Calculi) are the right ones to use. You should
    have treated with Appendictis Necroticans and/or Chronic Appendicitis.
    Further in the Footplate treatment, I would have used Kidney supports,
    Bladder supports and possibly Intestinal support like Nux Vomica.

    6. That the Adrenals still drop after three sessions might be due to the
    infections on her Kidneys, Bladder.

    7. If the person is difficult to measure might be due to insufficient fluid
    in the Skin, which is a Circulation problem. Some times it helps if I make
    the golden hand electrode very wet. Otherwise they measure mostly better
    after the normal hand treatment or include Atropinum in the hand
    treatment.This remedy relaxes the Blood Vessels, also in the Skin. If this
    is the case, this proves that she is in a permanent stressed condition in
    which the muscles in the Blood Vessels stay in a contracted state.

    8. No. If the points are still dropping it means that the Organ System is
    not in a state where it can function normally. A piece of cake does not
    make a difference to the capabilities of the Organ. The point that
    indicates the Hyper-Insulin normally comes right when the other glands
    (Pituitary, Parathyroid and Adrenals) have become in order. The Diabetes
    point on the other hand only reacts to Gallbladder remedies and will show
    drops until the Gallbladder has improved considerably.

    9. Advice is given in all of the above answers.

    Isn't it possible to correct diabetes with a ketogenic diet? When you
    reduce the carbs to below 40 grams a day, the body produces ketone bodies
    from free fatty acids, which all the cells can metabolize directly. And
    even better so than glucose.

    They even made a hardcore experiment in thé seventies, when they let a
    group fast for over 3 weeks, in the end the blood sugar levels were at 70,
    but the people had a high energy level due to the ketone bodies.

    Then they even injected them high doses of insuline, and their blood sugar
    levels dropped even more to below 20. Usually they should have been in
    coma, but they were perfectly fine, because the metabolism doidnt dépend on
    gucose anymore, and all the cells were running on ketone bodies.

    The good thing is that ketone bodies pass the blood brain barrier, and can
    also feed the brain cells. Even better than glucose.

    Just a supporting idea.

    There are even diabetics who dropped insuline shots completly, because if
    you don't consume carbs, you don't need them. However beware to then put
    the focus on fat, and not protein. As excessive protein can be
    resynthesised to glucose in gluco neogenesis. The Innuit who ate only meat
    and fish, warned their visitors, that you would get sick if you ate lean
    meat, and you need to eat it with pkenty of fat. Protein metabolism leads
    to vitamin a depletion, so you need the fat with it, and or organ meats,
    especially liver.

    Although this approach helps people with diabetes to be independent of
    insuline, they will have to stick to the diet permanently. When they go
    back to eating sugar and carbs they will become insuline dependent again.

    The experience with Biontology is that most cases of diabetes will resolve
    permanently. 

    Causal systems are Gallbladder and Duodenum.

    Ok, that is very good news Karolina.

    I was thinking of it perhaps as a supporting diet during biontology
    therapy.

    Also in cases of dementia and cell decay either a ketogenic diet or heavy
    doses of coconut oil (MCT oils are converted into ketone bodies, even if
    you are NOT fasting or on a ketogenic diet) have shown to reverse Alzheimer
    and other forms of dementia. In those cases, where it was caused by
    insuline insensivity of the brain cells.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    September 2015 edited September 2015 Flag
    Yes, this also has to do with the inflammatory action of carbs in the
    system... 

    However, it is best to initially maintain normal eating patterns in between
    Biontology sessions to allow the body to fully respond to the biophoton
    treatment. Giving the body another task, like adapting to a new diet, will
    divert energy away from our focus...

    If someone is already used to this diet and is using it for a long time
    (the body is adapted), then this is OK of course. But then the issue is
    that you will not be able to see whether there is real improvement in the
    ability of the body to deal with carbohydrates since there is hardly any
    intake...

    The course of treatment will not be endless. After you have balanced
    everything the client may want to choose to change diet, however, if all
    functions are OK again they may not be that interested anymore...

    Understood Karolina.

    I had posted this comment in another thread (kalium excess I think) where
    the discussion was about cellular atrophy due to the inability to absorb
    glucose because of insuline. Insensitivity.

    I thought this diet could be a good supporting régime for thé biontology
    treatment for such cases, as it could provide instant reiief and
    nourishment to those cells. Especially in urgent and dangerous cases (and
    of course, when the brain is atrophizing).

    Yes, I understand the intention, but I try to keep the posts on topic, and
    the topic of that post is high Potassium in general. This is caused by
    Kidney dysfunction mainly, but in order to be complete, also the
    possibility of rapid cellular destruction was mentioned. Diabetes is one
    cause of cellular destruction, but there can be other causes too. 

    Following all of the branches of this tree is all less relevant to
    Biontology, as what we need to do in case of high potassium is mainly
    strengthening the Kidneys and in case of diabetes treating the
    Gallbladder. 

    I hope you understand why I made this into a separate discussion.

May 2013 edited January 2014 in Spin Inversion & Cause Flag
1. Is a bed made from wood with a mattress without spirals good enough?

2. Is a foam rubber mattress OK?

3. When in a double bed one mattress has spirals, while the other one doesn't
can it affect the whole bed, or is the one who lies on the mattress without
spirals "safe"?

4. What is the minimal distance between the bed and electrical devices/clocks/
mobile phone?

5. Is a night lamp next to the bed harmful?

6. Is an electrical socket behind the bed harmful? Should the bed be moved in
this case?

7. What are the things we have to be careful with in the bed room, because they
can harm the aura?

    1. Yes, but watch the Frame of the Bed, there should be not Metal in there
    either.

    2. Yes, Foam Rubber is fine as far as Electro Magnetic influence concerned,
    Off Gassing might be another concern.

    3. The one that lies on the Mattress without Spirals is safe.

    4. 3 - 4 meters (9 - 13 feet)

    5. Sometimes a Night Light can be harmful. It depends on which way you plug
    it in. If you switch the plug around, the field will be stronger or weaker
   
    6. Generally not.
   
    7. Computers, TV, Mobile Phone. 
    Also watch devices in the rooms bordering your bedroom, especially look
    what is behind the wall where the head of your bed is...

    b. What is the influence of the electricity box/fuse box of a house?

    c. Is there a way to detect if the Earth Magnetic Field is unhealthy where
    a client sleeps?

    d. Can you measure clients in their bed to find out if there's a disturbing
    field? 

    e. What about a bed that is right underneath a Solar Panel (2nd floor)
    which is only activated by the sun in the afternoon to blow warm air in the
    living room downstairs? The Panel is not connected to electricity.
    Can this cause Spin Inversion/Aura Weakness when sleeping in bedroom?

    a) wifi can have a reach/range of 300 meters

    b) If it is close enough, it is very disturbing. I feel you should be 5
    meters away at any time.

    c) Yes, there are ways to measure it, but the apparatus is rather
    expensive.

    d) You can try. Measure the client first outside their bed, then measure
    them in their bed. You will see the difference.

    e) It still acts as antenna. It could be disturbing, but I do not know. I
    have had no experience with it.

    I think you have misunderstood what was explained in class, since Radio
    Alarm Clocks do give these symptoms of Headaches... they are the worst. 
    Battery alarm clocks are safe...

    A watch is also battery operated, but usually the sound is not very loud
    and only noticeable when it is worn. Wearing a battery watch is something
    you should never do though... every time the second pointer is moving it
    gives a large EM impulse....

    A Kinetic Watch gives no EM pulses, so this might be a good alternative.

    Johan never advises clients to take of their Watches though... it doesn't
    give a big enough disturbance to effect the measurement.
    But considering the EM pulse every second, it is a stress factor that is
    preventable and a choice for a different Watch is easy..

February 2016 - The Final Q&A

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
February 17 edited February 18 in Q&A Flag
This was the final Q&A.

It has been quite a journey explaining Biontology to you these past few years.
And I hope you all enjoyed and benefitted from it.

The years prior to my arrival in the United States in 2011, I was hardly
involved in teaching anymore, as I was already working towards my retirement
from Biontology. The whole idea was to set up a business -the Institute for
Applied Biophoton Sciences- that would run itself so that I could get back into
the field of research.
Well, as you all know, this did not work out exactly as I planned, and I soon
became aware that the decision to let go of guiding my teachers and office
manager was taken too soon. I had listened to their words and assumed they had
a level of skill, proactivity, loyalty and integrity that simply was not there,
and this mistake has brought me on the brink of bankruptcy.
Personal disappointment, however, has never been my motivation. All decisions
that I have made since then were made with the sole intent to save Biontology.

It was clear to me that Biontology needed far better explanations as to prevent
practitioners from straying unconsciously. And the only way I felt I could
protect the integrity of Biontology and the safety of clients, was to take on
the responsibility of teaching again myself, and with the never failing
assistance and effort of Karolina I embarked on a journey to translate my way
of working into protocols and to set straight the many misconceptions that the
teachers I employed created over the years. To all of you who were confronted
with the difficult situation that you had to let go of these faulty ideas, I
apologize. But at least all the right information is available now, and also
the explanation as to why some ideas that were taught were not right.

Both the forum and Q&A’s have been set up as instruments to achieve this goal,
and I feel relieved and happy, as I hope you feel as well, that, although
circumstances caused the forum to become read-only, which was not our
intention, the task of making my teachings available, in fact HAS been
completed. All essential answers on how to treat people effectively and safely
have been given, but most importantly in our answers you can find a way of
thinking that you can try to make your own, so in the future you will be able
to answer your own questions that right now may SEEM unanswered.

Even though every case is unique, the basic elements and the basic approach of
assessment and treatment are always the same, and the moment you have mastered
all of your Biontology tools, you can apply them as to find the individual
approach every client needs. All that is needed now for you to become great
Biontologists is to study the available information IN DEPTH, and to not be
lured into thinking that you need the guidance of someone else. At the moment
there is not even one teacher out there who knows more about Biontology than
what is written on the forum. The guideline should be: if it is not in the
manual or on the forum, please discard it! Although we have been able to keep
the forum free from misinformation, the heads of many of your fellow
practitioners who stopped listening after their basic course are still filled
with nonsense.

My advice is to read the manual many times, learn every aspect of it by heart,
and then go to the forum to test your own understanding by trying to comment on
cases and questions yourself. The elaborate answers under each case will reveal
to you whether you are on the right track and made similar observations. Then
in your practice, apply Biontology in line with what you have learned, and
reflect on what your measurements and results are to see if there are
discrepancies. Always stay open to learn…

Maybe, lately, I have emphasized too much how difficult it is to master
Biontology, but that is only because I saw so many of you were choosing the
easy road and never went in depth with your studies. Too many times we have
been confronted with practitioners who did not even read or remember things
that were repeated many times on the forum. Or at least these things were not
applied in their practice. Even in the most recent applications for
certification I had to pinpoint, several times, the most fundamental and
dangerous mistake one can make, and that is treating Heavy Metals, Toxins, and
the Liver, before the Yang organs and Kidneys have been cleared. This is not a
matter of missing information or guidance. This is a matter of just not using
optimally the information that is provided. But when you DO use the available
information, you ALL truly can become good Biontologist, and I have certainly
not given up on supporting the professionalization of the Biontology community.
Even though, this community right now can be counted on two hands.

Every one of you who wants to become a Biontologist can still be certified. The
only thing that changes is, that there will be no further active teaching
available. Some of you may be angry or disappointed, but we have been available
24/7 for over 3 years now, and when you look at it realistically, it simply was
impossible to continue this Master class indefinitely. We did not have any
leisure time anymore and even Karolina has a breaking point. I hope you also
realize that Forum and Q&A’s were always an extra service, and they were never
calculated into the price. Not in the price of membership, and not in the price
of the Chiren or classes. They were our, but especially Karolina's gift to you,
as the most work was in the editing, monitoring and translating my words to
your understanding. She never had the ambition of becoming a teacher, and those
of you who know her personally, know this to be true, as she frequently stated
this openly. Her only motivation was to get all possible insights and
information on Biontology out there for every practitioner to access, so
everyone would be able to practice both effectively and safely. I think she
succeeded, but now it is time for you to make the most out of all that has been
shared.

The reality is that active guidance has come to an end. Some of you have used
the forum and Q&A’s optimally, some maybe not. But even if you did not
participate before, there are enough questions from other practitioners that
can help you when you are stuck. The forum has become an incredible library
where more than 1000 topics have been discussed.

My final words are words of gratitude to all of you who have supported us in
even the most difficult times, and to all of you who have sent us encouraging
and supportive emails. I am most grateful to read that many of you do
understand the difficult position in which we are right now, and that no other
decision was possible. Often life takes you in different directions than you
had anticipated...

Karolina and I wish all of you well with your practice and studies, and hope
that you continue to see value in Health Angel membership. Health Angel
Foundation is there solely to provide service to you and it has no other source
of revenue than membership fees and some spare part sales to cover the costs.
Robert will maintain close contact with us on matters of professionalization of
the Biontology field, if this comes up. I am happy to provide licencing to
valid Biontology initiatives that are initiated by Certified Biontologists.

Good luck and good travels!

Client with MTHFR Gene Mutation

Jiri
March 2014 edited March 2014 in General Questions Flag
Client:
I have a possible new client who has been diagnosed with MTHFR gene mutation. 

Current symptoms include: 
Adrenal fatigue, 
Leaky gut syndrome, 
Food and drug sensitivities 
Muscle weakness. 

History:
She has had symptoms since her early 20's when she was undergoing a stressful
situation. 

Questions:
1. Since she has not had symptoms since birth, will biophoton therapy work? 

2. Has anyone had experience with MTHFR mutations?

    Answers:
    1. I do not see how the doctor's diagnosis or the time that your client has
    not had symptoms has anything to do with the treatment's effectiveness.
    Biontontology can be helpful in every condition as long as the Physical
    Body can still respond to the changes in the Light. This however is
    independent from the particular disease diagnosis a client has gotten in
    the past.


    Further comments
    Gene mutations can occur at any time. The magnetic fields in which we all
    live can make hydrogen bonds jump and can be replaced by anything. In the
    past I have succeeded in reversing Genetically Modified infertile corn to
    its original fertile state within 1 generation by treating the seed. Also
    bacteria that have developed, by gene mutation, resistance to antibiotics,
    can be reversed to their original condition.

    In recent times a lot of problems have been associated with gene mutations,
    It is simply a cop out diagnosis. Recently most diagnoses are either
    "genetic, a virus or it is between your ears". All situations where the MD
    is excused because he cannot do anything about it.

    If there is a gene mutation that creates a sensitivity to certain bodily
    dysfunctions, it is our job to find out why this particular expression is
    triggered. If the genetic expression of the MTHFR dysfunctional gene would
    be inevitable then your client would have shown symptoms from birth…
    You can find out the answers by measuring and really think about what could
    have caused this. Do think for yourself and do not accept anything unless
    it is confirmed by measurements and symptom removal.
    Everyone has their personal sensitivities, but nothing has to come to
    expression without a Cause to trigger it.

    Based on the symptoms, there seem to be a variety of causes. Just follow
    the protocol and look for coincidences, things that are logical.
    Adrenal fatigue is common.
    Muscle weakness indicates the Liver.
    Leaky gut indicates Appendicitis.
    All these symptoms can lead to the Symptoms you described. Food and Drug
    Sensitivities might indicate a Spin Inversion, which might also cause the
    Fatigue…
    Heavy Metals might cause sensitivity to Spin Inversion...
    The Spin Inversion is not a cause that can be recognised by medical
    profession. So this might be the main problem.

    Just measure and draw your conclusions. Measuring often gives a lot of
    clues.

    This s a GREAT explanation Johan, It is why people (like me) can recover
    from certain types of leukemia caused by a Jak2 mutation. When it is
    switched on by various causes (Radiation?) it can be switched off by
    biontology.

"Do you Really Believe in Curing TB/Bacteria ?"

Beate
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Biontology Insights Flag
I went to an informal gathering last night, and several people discussed
different therapies.

The husband of one of the women is a doctor who tests Pharmaceutical Drugs on
patients with Lung Disease. He's a Specialist in his Field for many years. The
woman also is a doctor in Physiotherapy.

She said, she has never heard such nonsense as Meridians and Biophoton Therapy.
She has written books and papers about Lung Illnesses of all kinds....
"How come we think we can cure Turberculosis and other Bacteria with Light?"
Frequences she has never heard about, and asked me to tell her in a Scientific
Language what this is..  Also she wanted Randomized Research results about the
Biophoton Light Therapy.
She claimed in a rude way that there is only one way to determine if people
have the Bacteria.......she went on and on.

She was into Vaccinations, and wondered what we would think after the big
outbreak now in Wales.This must be a troubled person, and I saw no point in
arguing with a half drunk neurotic.

The reason I bring this up on the forum is to see if there might be some right
answers to her questions, that will calm people down.

    Thank you for bringing this up Beate... This is really a very important
    issue, since we have to build that Bridge to bring more acceptance for the
    Radical New Perspective on Healing we present.

    You won't be able to convince a true Sceptic, but it is important to
    present what you're doing without making too many Assumptions. If you
    present what you are doing/knowing in a honest/humble way you'll see that
    people are more open to listen to you. 
    Making claims as to be able to Cure anything is a big NO. Since we don't
    know what is happening in the body physically after Treatment. What we do
    know is that we see positive changes that are often remarkable.... 
    Just talk about the miracles you've witnessed yourself, don't make claims
    about what has been experienced by other practitioners. You can best speak
    from own knowledge and experience...

    Because we don't monitor the body like these people do, we can't say that
    we eliminate Tuberculosis physically. Actually elimination isn't what
    happens anyway.... We don't kill bugs. We help the body to function
    optimally so it can deal with the bugs. This makes the difference between
    someone who gets an infection and gets over it in a relatively short time
    and someone who suffers from it continuously.

    So when you present Biontology there are several important things to
    mention:

    1. The Scientific Discovery of the Faint Light Emission by Popp and the
    observation that Ill people show Incoherent Light, whereas Healthy people
    show Coherence in their Light.

    2. The Scientifically proven relationship between Coherence of Light and
    the Skin Resistance in an Acupuncture point. So by using Skin Resistance
    Measurement we can tell something about this level of Coherence of Light in
    the Different points.

    3. Explain how Incoherent Frequencies are reversed like in Sound
    Cancellation (sound is frequencies, light acts as frequencies too), so the
    Chiren causes a Cancellation of the Incoherent Light. When this is done,
    Self Healing seems to improve and then it is often a big surprise to us
    Practitioners to see what the body still is capable of restoring. We don't
    Heal anything! 
    We have a Non Invasive method of restoring something that has proven, in
    our experience, to be a major factor in Health: Biophoton Coherence. 

    4. The experiences you had with the Instrument that Johan developed to
    restore Coherence on the Level of Light. Since personal experiences can't
    be denied!

    5. That it is shown in Tests in Vitro, that in Tissue Infected with
    Bacteria, when treated with the Chiren, the Bacteria don't die, but the
    Tissue stays healthy and the Bacteria become less active. So no we don't
    Cure Tuberculosis!

    6. That it has shown, in your experience with Biontology, that
    Energetically Vaccinations are very disturbing to the Bodily System and
    that you're not sure about the Pro's weighing up to the Con's. Nuance
    again!! Denying everything they believe in without trying to see their
    perspective is doing the same thing as they do.... 

    7. Tell her about the Research that has been done on Chronically Ill
    Children.... it is on the Biontology.com website:
    http://www.biontology.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/
    Research-chronic-complaints-in-children.pdf

    It is not all black and white, I actually treated a Girl who had been part
    of a Sect where Medical Intervention like Vaccination was a big NO. So she
    wasn't Vaccinated. Growing up she lost many friends because of Childhood
    Diseases they were not Vaccinated for.... 
    I still wouldn't choose Vaccination myself, because I believe it destroys
    the Immune System and causes many Chronic Conditions. But this story tells
    me there's more nuance to it. 
    These are also the stories that Medical Doctors see and have experience
    with... We have observations, but they do too!! Denying that is creating a
    Gap that you can't Bridge... 

    But why would you want to go to a meeting like that anyway? The best way to
    spread what you're doing is just "word of mouth". The Results speak for
    themselves, so you don't have to speak... When they come to you, you can
    speak. But then there's an Openness to Receive....

    The meeting was to get to know people from other countries then Spain :) I
    arrived with a couple of friends, and then this person joined in around our
    table. Everybody introduced themselves, and she was not able to contain
    herself I guess.

    Actually I did not say very much, I was speachless to be honest ....The
    woman next to me said she felt so much better after my Scar Treatment and
    the Treatment from me in general.
    I agree that we are assisting and restoring the body. I am aware of this
    approach.


    PS. The person denied the Measurement of Coherent and Non Coherent Light,
    although she said she had heard about measureing the Skin Electrical
    Ability....and this had nothing to do with Light or Biophotons.

    I can not say am for or against Vaccinations, I know not enough of the
    topic. I thought the Chiren neutralized
    the items surronding the Vaccination itself, since the Vaccination is gone
    after a certain while?

    This is how I remember from my training back then. Thanks

    Now I understand the setting.... yes this is a difficult situation, since
    someone just starts to attack you on what you're doing... She must think
    she's an authority of some kind ;-) 

    And in a way she's right because it is Skin Conductivity we measure and not
    directly the Biophotons, but in research it has shown that there's a
    correlation between Skin Conductivity and Biophoton Coherence. You can find
    this research on the Biontology website.....
    http://www.biontology.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/
    Correlatie-skinresistance-biophotons.pdf

    The Vaccinations disappear as an Energetic Disturbance after the Chiren
    Treatment, that doesn't mean their complete effect is gone. Anti-bodies
    will still be measurable in the Blood....

Vasectomy - Therapy Resistance?

janjan
January 2013 edited February 2014 in Therapy Resistance Flag
Client: 50 year old healthy looking, married fireman with children, has had
intestinal problems on and off for 17 years, progressivly getting worse. He
also has sore and bleeding hemorrhoids. In childhood there was a serious
accident that tore the inside of his ureter ( I did not do scar whiplash on it 
;-) ). He is not responding well to treatment, possibly because of his
vasectomy. An emotional problem he experiences revolves around his father
(father issues).

Medical interventions: Vasectomy - however I treated him and asked that he come
back the next day for me to measure him and his remedies had held the next day
so I believed he could hold a remedy.

Drops after the initial treatment:
Large Intestine meridians on both hands - all  points drop, also the anus point
and the appendix
Liver meridian - all drops
Gallbladder meridian - all drops
Bladder meridian - all drops

The first two treatments
HIs Bladder (first 2 treatments had drops) and Gallbladder don't show any drops
after the 2nd treatment. The Liver still shows issues. 
For the Gallbladder I used: Cholecystitis, Billiary Cirrhosis, Injeel Chol,
Calculli Renalis and Calculli Bil (both 2 times) 

All three treatments all these meridians/points were dropping
Adrenals (Pituitary, Parathyroid and Thyroid are all corrected though)
Both Large Intestine meridians + anus-point
Organ Degeneration meridian 
Liver meridian
 
Remedies I found are: 
Carcinoma Coli, Polyp Larynges, Polyp Nasalis, Fibroma Pendulum, Carcinoma
Hepatis and Carcinoma Hepatis Metastasis, Mysterica Sebifera (corrected several
points on the left large intestines!) and Periopric Abscess, I alternate the
use of these plus Luesinium.

I have used Appendicitis Necroticans in the first treatment and Chronic
Appendicitis in the other two. 

I am also using Psorium for therapy resistance.

Other remedies used are: Herpes Zoster, Herpes Simplex, kidney support, Mucosa,
Glyoxal, Podophylum, Schwefeel, Solidago, Hepeel, Galium, Ubchinon, Coenzyme
and Lymphomyost.

I used Procranium for the scarring on the inside of his ureter (is that the
correct one for internal scars?) Sorry these are not all in order of treatment,
I hope you can get an overview of this.
My concern is continuing to see Carcinoma Coli and Carcinoma Hepatis each time
and the treatment doesn't seem to work. Is three sessions too soon to see
this...  When I treat the Intestines and the Gallbladder, the Adrenals clear
up.  

There is no food poisoning I believe as I have not measured it. 
What else can you suggest?   Thank you for your help.

    Hello Jan,
   
    There are several aspects of therapy resistance that are commonly
    misunderstood. 
    With vasectomy, the trouble is not if someone "can hold a remedy". It's all
    about the physical body being able to respond to it. Even if the energetic
    body does respond and is healed completely, the physical symptoms can
    remain. So you can only see if somebody is therapy resistant by looking at
    the physical response.
   
    The therapy resistance remedies have little use in the case of vasectomy,
    because it is not a blocked Pituitary gland that causes this type of
    therapy resistance.

    What I notice in your treatment is that I miss the right order/priority of
    addressing issues. The Hormonal System always needs to be cleared up
    completely first. Even if you correct the drops on the Adrenals every
    treatment, there's a reason for it to continue to drop every session and
    more attention is needed to find out what that cause is and then get that
    out of the way.

    Another thing is that it is very likely that the Appendicitis Necroticans
    hasn't healed after just one treatment. Someone who has severe intestinal
    problems for such a long time as your client has, usually needs this remedy
    more then once. So don't forget to look for this. Maybe Chronic
    Appendicitis gave some improvement of the Appendix point but Appendicitis
    Necroticans would have made a bigger difference. Did you measure for it the
    second time?

    Myristica Sebifera is a support remedy and should only be used once all the
    dropping points are balanced by nosodes. Otherwise it is likely to mask the
    cause.

    Hemorrhoids are the result of downward pressure in the Veins, The cause of
    this are the Adrenals and/or the Heart. (Gallbladder problems or
    constipation can also cause pressure) The result is weakening of the valves
    in the Veins. You can use Hamamelis, Apis and possibly Nux Vomica for this
    as a support to heal the damage to the veins, but again the main focus is
    on the Adrenals (and/or Heart) since they keep showing up and that is where
    the cause is for downward pressure (weakening the veins). The Adrenals are
    also very important because weakness in these glands can cause a lack of
    energy for healing. 

    If the downward pressure causing the hemorrhoids is caused by constipation
    (I don't know from your story what the nature of the intestinal problems
    is) this should be out of the way too before the hemorrhoids can heal. It
    is unlikely that the hemorrhoids will heal before the Adrenals and
    Intestines are corrected. First the pressure has to be lifted.

    In addittion to the Appendicitis Necroticans nosodes, you could use
    Anginheel and Tonsilla Compositum to help heal the Appendix. But there's
    always the possibility for the Appendix to be dead already.

    Based on your answer, I feel I must have miscommunicated something, or not
    stated it in the correct way... 
   
    My priority is the hormonal system and all points have  remedied including
    the adrenals in the standard treatment in all sessions. Only... the
    adrenals remain dropping in the following treatments - and this is where I
    am asking for additional help in understanding why they are falling even
    tho' they remedy in the prior treatment.. 

    I am using selenium as it measures but what I found is that the adrenals
    remedy once I put in all the LI remedies.  Perhaps I am not saying this
    correctly. I used seleneium  but I believe I remember you saying in class
    when the adrenals have problems remaining clear to try other remedies on
    them like the GB, or FP, or Tonsils, and in this case the LI (appendix)
    does remedy the adrenals. Am I understanding what you said then?  Hpw else
    can I support the adrenals in this man's case. 

    Additionaly I am using all nosodes in the standard program and many nosodes
    in the FB only using supports when there are spaces left on FP.  I will
    check my appendix measurements more carefully as you feel the necrotians
    could not have progressed to chronic, and I will use the  suggested
    anginheel and tonsilla comp. I appreciate  the understanding of hemorrhoid
    cause and will try the suggested vein remedies.

    Confused a bit still... as in our prior commuications with this client you
    did say to use psorium, schwefeel and pyroginium on him for remedy
    resistance even tho' he had a vasectomy, yet above you say therapy
    resistant remedies are of little value in vasectomys. Should we use them or
    not?   I do have clients with vasectomys recovering from their maladies,
    but in this case I am wondering if it is the vasectomy that is in the way.
     

    I remember in you measuring the client with Non hodgkins lymphoma that
    because of the metal in her mouth you asked her to come back hours later
    and she did not "hold" the remedying as her points were then down.  She was
    told the chiren would not work for her.  So the inverse is not true?    if
    they hold remedies hours later or the next day, they can still be
    energetically accepting it but physically resistant?  When will I know?

    I'm sorry for all the confusion. I'll try to clarify some of Johan's
    remarks.
    I don't know what is said in class…

    This is the way Johan works when the Adrenals still drop after the
    Pituitary gland and Parathyroid don't drop anymore.
    1. He first tries Selenium and Berberis.
    2. Then the Vaccinations / Childhood diseases
    3. If there's still no solution he tests for issues of the Sexual Glands
    (e.g. Adenoma Prostata, Ovarial Cyst)
    4. Finally he tests for toxic substances (e.g. Formaldehyde, Insecticides)
    5. It is very uncommon that after step 4 there's still no solution
    found.......... but Biontology is full of surprises!

    Regarding the confusion on whether to use Schwefheel, Psorinum and
    Pyrogenium in cases of vasectomy:
    Of course you can still treat for this kind of therapy resistance too, just
    to make sure to unblock the Pituitary gland. If then there's still no
    response from the body you can be more certain that it is truly therapy
    resistance because of vasectomy you're dealing with.
    I think 3 treatments is not enough to talk about therapy resistance though.
    I would personally think about that after about 5 treatments.

    The example about therapy resistance with metal in the mouth also needs
    some clarification:
    If metal in the mouth is disturbing, it is affecting the energetics of the
    body. So this means that the energetic remedies won't hold. This is easy to
    check some time after treatment. If all drops come back after just a couple
    of hours you'll know that something disturbed the energetics of the body
    again. There is in a way an "energetic therapy resistance". - In this
    particular case the metal brought the client back into spin-inversion all
    the time. When there's spin-inversion the healing stops.

    This is something different then the body not being able to act on an
    energetic change that does hold. In that type of therapy resistance there's
    a physical blockage e.g. in the Pituitary gland that stops the body from
    acting on the energetic input.

    I hope this at least cleared some of your question marks.

    Thank you, He is coming today and I will consider what you have said. In
    looking at your adrenal protocols I have done most, but one specifically
    triggered that he is a fireman and I need to check further for toxins
    (lncluding formaldehyde again) from smoke inhalation. 

    In answering your question, yes I did measure for necrotians in both
    following treatments and it did not measure but I will see what happens
    today, and pay special attention to it, as all other points on both LI
    meridians have previously falllen.  Also trying remedies, as his anus point
    is so very sore and he feels it is indicitive of his lower LI ache and
    pain., I did use perioptic abcess, but remembered in class that we were
    told to use mysterica as a great remedy for that also, i mistakenly thought
    it was a nosode.  When I put in Periprotic A. it cleared on that point,
    when I put in Myristerica it cleared 3 points, so i thought perhaps all may
    have been absessed. So if I understand you, using this to remedy  on the
    anus point may mask the true cause and i should use periproptic because it
    as a nosode. correct?   He clearly "feels" the condition of "down there"
    reflects the condition of "In there" ...the colon.   

    Thank you for the clarification of the metal in the mouth "energetic"
    remedy resistant vs the vasectomy. 
     He is willing to go on with many more treatments once i had an answer
    regarding his possible remedy resistance. He is basing his willingness to
    go forth on the fact that I had to have many treatments to become well in a
    complicated serious illness.

    Hi Jan,

    Thank you for answering again, this gives more insight in your thought
    process. 

    I think if there's an abscess of the anal region, Myristica Sebifera can be
    a great support on top of the Periproctic Abcess. It is interesting how it
    energetically corrected more points since it is mainly indicated for
    abscesses, fistulae and acute pussy inflammations. Abscesses are more
    serious then hemorrhoids... they are far more painful and are often
    accompanied by fever.

    A common cause for abscesses in the intestines is diverticulitis, so I
    would use the nosode Diverticulosis for this and the nosode Pyrogenium or
    Sutoxol for the pus formation and possible fever. And of course Myristica
    Sebifera since you already measured it.

    To support with the bleeding (is it bad?), you could use Phosphorus. This
    remedy is also good with abscesses.

    Some feedback about todays session:
    Today was the 4th session, one week from the last. 
    The colorectal ache has reduced by half and he experienced much more
    energy! He's feeling better for the first time in a long time. So he is not
    remedy resistant. The effect of the three prior treatments seemed to kick
    in all at once.

    Adrenals: not dropping anymore for the first time! 
    Triple Warmer meridian: no drops  

    Large Intestines meridian (left): cleared except for the Anus point -
    Periproctic Abscess was measured
    Large Intestines (right): all points still dropped - tried Appendicitis
    Necroticans today but Chronic Appendicitis matched like before, I treated
    with Appendicitis Necroticans too  though, as you suggested.

    He also still measured for Carcinoma Coli

    Veins meridian: some drops - corrected with Apis and Hammamelis.
      
    Gall Bladder - no drops
    Liver points - no drops   

    Small Intestines - Salmonella Typhi 

    I will continue to work with him on the Large and Small Intestines

    Thank you for your suggestions, I now understand more in depth solutions
    for remedying the adrenals. Although I didn't need it now, it will be
    helpful in the future. 

    I feel relieved as he does that he is responding. I know three treatments
    was early to be concerned but I just have not yet seen someone not respond
    on such critical points in three sessions - thus the question  of remedy
    resistance and vasectomy.

    Thanks Jan,

    I'm really happy the fireman now experiences results. Needing 3 treatments
    is not unusual to see real changes in how a client feels. 

    Can you tell me where exactly you found the Carcinoma Coli?

    I think this whole case was very educational and I hope we still get some
    follow up when the fireman is fully recovered.
  •

    January 2013 edited January 2013 Flag
    Yes, as you say above ... three treatments is not unusual to see real
    changes in a client which clearly relates to my whole line of questioning.
    However as I stated above in my feedback and in my initial forum question
    was my concern that I was not seeing the changes I usually see in three
    treatments, and that made me wonder about remedy resistance, and why I was
    not seeing changes. Fortunately -  I did see major changes in the 4th
    session resulting from the 1st three sessions. 

     In your question where did I measure carcinoma coli, this is an area I am
    a bit unsure about, and hope for guidance as to whether this measurement
    place is correct. I measured it on the right hand on the organ degeneration
    point just below the knuckle closest to the hand or..the second point up
    from the base of the hand.   
    I understood that if we found a drop there it indicated that there was
    degeneration and it signaled that we could measure for different carcinomas
    of suspect on a point on that meridian that was relevant -  and that point
    that dropped was relevant to the what I was seeing on the LI.  I also
    thought that he said if we could measure it .... a carcinoma on the org.
    deg meridan then it was showing as physical. I hope all this makes sense, I
    am just stating it as I wrote it down and understood it, so clarification
    would be good.   
   
    Additionally in class I believe it was said you can also us it as a remedy
    on the LI as it has broad remedying capabilities for a number of colon
    maladies. But where I measured it was on the Organ degeneration, and I
    added glyoxol on the FP for support.  Are these measurements correct?

    We can never make conclusive statements on whether someone has or hasn't
    got cancer. But if you would measure like in your case Carcinoma Coli on
    the Organ Degeneration meridian and then at the same time Carcinoma Coli on
    the Large Intestines meridian that would be an indication that there is a
    big chance that there is physical cancer. 

    In your example - but maybe you haven't mentioned all your steps - you
    remedied the Large Intestines meridian completely with Chronic Appendicitis
    and Periproctic Abscess. For this you didn't need the Carcinoma Coli
    remedy. This can be good news in that the condition the fireman has is
    probably no cancer. 

    If you would leave the Chronic Appendicitis out though and then wait for a
    while (couple of minutes until all points drop again) and then would
    measure for Carcinoma Coli and it corrects the Large Intestines along with
    the Organ Degeneration, this might be a way that you could still find the
    indication for physical cancer. So you might want to try that next time.

    Carcinoma Coli, but also the other cancer remedies can be measured and used
    for other conditions then cancer too. So if you try it and it corrects a
    point you shouldn't be too scared.

    Thank you for your explanation.  I am not making any assumptions whether he
    does or does not really, I am just trying to look at them all as
    disturbances and not illnesses... and trying to make sure I measure
    correctly to give the right remedy the point is asking for.  This helped
    (above) 
     And honestly, I am not scared really by this or the other clients that
    have shown for carcinomas both w/ biophoton or western med, just concerned
    and always hopeful.  The good news is, as we shared above, that he is not
    remedy resistant and is making progress, and...feels better!

    But I think by making an attempt things really can become clearer to us
    all. 

    And since it is all about clients getting better, I'm happy with your

    I am happy to report that this client has made major changes and went from
    his many points dropping (particularly his Large Intestines, Appendix,
    Adrenals, and Anus point and Organ Degeneration) and mostly not changing
    for three sessions (which was why I was concerned about remedy resistance) 
    to ... 
   
    as I wrote about above in his 4th session he cleared on some major points
    (Adrenals!) and was remedying and feeling better to...
   
    his 5th appointment today which was very exciting only one drop on right
    hand -  Appendicitis matched,( not chronic this time) one point dropped on
    the left Nervous System and it matched to Insecticides (They were crop
    spraying near his fire station!) and his Kidneys needed support Solidago &
    Populus (detoxing, I am sure) I supported with Mucosa, Nux Vomica and
    Psorium, Coenzyme and Ubchinon.

    He feels a major shift ( no colorectal ache) and says things are moving in
    the right direction as far as how he is feeling ...finally. He has dealt
    with this for 17 years off and on.  He did say he had a very big energy
    surge last week several days after his treatment which was very unusual.
     He prior to that had been very wiped out by treatments.

    I am excited to see evidence that he is not remedy resistant and  he is
    responding very well to treatment.
    Thanks for all the help.

    Hi all,

    I'm new to the forum and have been reading this thread with great interest.
    Great to hear that the fireman is recovering!

    I have a question about Johan's remark at the end of his post of January 27
    that the Appendix could already be dead. Is there a way to measure if the
    appendix is dead?

    Hello George,

    The Appendix being dead is not very common, but always a possibility that
    you have to keep in the back of you mind. If Appendicitis Necroticans keeps
    showing up on the Appendix Point every treatment and never changes quality,
    this can be an indication that the Appendix is not capable anymore to
    restore itself. 

    To be able to make a decision like that, you need to treat someone every
    week (no extended breaks in between) for several times and then see no
    change in the Appendix.

    I am happy to share feedback on this client (that was very afraid he had
    colon cancer).

     He feels better than he has in 17 years  ( remember his his adrenals were
    difficult to remedy, we had the thought of possible vasectomy remedy
    resistance.) He now has energy!

    Now and all his points are balanced other than a drop on the Small
    Intestine and Kidney, he had an inflammation on his big toe (gout) 

    >12 program:
    Measurement: Uric Acid, Calculi Renalis (no other other nosodes needed) 
    Support: Populus, Aesculus, Tonico, Berberis, Pulsitilla, Neuralga Rheum. 
     
    Footplates:
    Atropinium and Reneel

    He has felt so well, he "forgot" the last 2 appointments! Says he'll check
    in in a few months. He is one happy fireman!

    About Arthritis:

    Any form of arthritis is caused by Kidney malfunction.
    The Kidneys do not take sufficient Uric Acid out of the blood.
    The blood then dumps the Uric Acid in the joints and after that in the
    tissues.
    First affected are the joints furthest away from the vital organs. This
    means in the hands and feet.

    You need to find out what the problem in the Kidneys is. It could be
    anything from Intestinal Flora to a Toxin like Formaldehyde. Or it could be
    the Adrenal Glands, but that is not very common.

    If you have found the culprit, you also need to support the Kidneys with
    all the Kidney supports that are in the Chiren.
    In following treatments one could use the nosode Uric Acid and Circulation
    remedies.

    My personal experience with many clients is that the deformities can go
    away by this approach.

    The deformities are in the beginning indeed the swelling and the cramped

    November 2015 edited November 2015 Flag
    Answer
    In a normal session for children the footplate (dyslexia) treatment is not
    used. 
    On the 2-7 years program, you can can give both nosodes and supports, i.e. 
    4 nosodes and 4 supports.

    A few nosodes is generally sufficient. I would not use 8 nosodes, since in
    a child there are organ systems that are still being developed, so I
    believe you should be careful with the use of the nosodes, more careful
    than you have to be with adults.

Working with Animals

I am new to Biontology. I started my training in Walnut Creek in December. I am

I am not sure if this protocol will be covered in future on-line courses but I
would love some input on how to do this.
Thanks!

    hi sally, i am in the process of introducing a holistic vet to biontology.
     i remember nora stating to add the remedies to the water of the animal via
    the fiber-optic cable, without handles in the water.

    Thank you Sharon,

    That is one possibility to do it, but it would be quite the same as giving
    a homeopathic remedy. Although it can be very effective when normal Chiren
    treatment is no option, the better choice is always to treat animals
    directly with the glass rods or footplates. 

    Some practitioners who work with horses use straps to connect the rods to
    the legs. If you just do the homeopathics in water, you miss out on the
    biophoton treatment (filtering, inverting the chaotic light and amplifying
    the coherent light) that is so healing in itself.
   
    Another thing that you have to consider is that many animals have Whiplash
    and you can only resolve this by treating the neck with the scar/whiplash
    program of the Chiren.
   
    To find out which remedies to treat with you can go by symptoms or
    surrogate measure on a human (preferably the owner instead of yourself).
    The steps to take for surrogate measuring are:
   
    1, Clearing the surrogate (person who is measured instead of the animal) of
    energetic disturbances completely.
   
    2. Connecting a footplate into the port that is normally used for the cup 
   
    3. Putting a picture of the animal face down on this plate.
   
    4. Measuring the surrogate (owner) as usual and finding remedies to correct
    the imbalances
   
    5. Treating the animal with the remedies that are found, with the glass
    rods or footplates (don't forget to reconnect the fiberoptic wire that is
    in the cup-port to the treatment port).
    If the animal is not present and you only have a picture to work with you
    can also put the picture between the plates for treatment, but don't forget
    to reconnect the wires properly for treatment
   
    6. repeating step 2 and 3


    Animals often have food poisoning. So this is something you always have to
    consider. Canned food can also cause heavy metal poisoning... Look at the
    symptoms, environment and diet of animals and you'll come a long way.
   
    Good luck

    Karolina,
    I think I can probably use a bandana to strap the glass rods to my dog. I
    don't think it would work with a cat. Is it a problem to hold the glass
    rods under the cats arms if you are not touching the glass, only the metal
    part of the rods?  If I was only using the glass rods would I do 2 standard
    treatments? For what length of time?

    Isn't it possible to measure out the hair, and treat the hair of the
    animal? 

    What is best, and why? Because thats what i been doing.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    January 2013 edited January 2013 Flag
    Sally: you can hold the glass rods on the metal but I do know of
    practitioners who hold the glass and the paws in one grip. This of course
    holds the danger that if you have resonance with it you can pick up some of
    the energy. Practitioners who do it like this don't seem to experience any
    problems though.... it is your choice. My preference is to use a strap or
    otherwise only touch the metal.

    Liselotte: the picture is more effective then the hair in measuring, or
    otherwise you best use some saliva. To treat, neither the hair or saliva
    will be sufficient. The energy of a hair is the energy of the location
    where the hair was taken. The picture has the whole (energetic) image of
    the animal in it.

    program. Is this okay to do? They are not around for me to test so I look
    at their history and their symptoms and any other information the owner may

    If i treat an animal i always try to arrange one treatment on place. So i
    can do a wiplash treatments. The horses i have treated have responded so
    strong to that. Could you do wiplash treatmens from a distance on a picture
    and get the same effect you think? Do you wiplash on back from ears to the
    tale, with 10 cm between glassrodes, or do you follow the hors spine? I
    have heard diffrent things, so want to be sure.:) this forum is
    wonderfull,thanks!!
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    January 2013 edited January 2013 Flag
    Hi liselotte,

    Because Whiplash is an energetic condition you don't need to create small
    portions of 10 cm to treat. Just put the one rod in the neck on the level
    of the ears and put the other rod on the back on the level of the
    shoulders. Then run the full whiplash program and to treat the rest of the
    spine you can go from the shoulders all the way to the tail or if more
    convenient make two portions out of it. However each portion you create has
    to be treated with the full whiplash program, without moving the rods.

    I've never tried to treat whiplash on a picture and Johan only did it once.
    It seemed to work then, but to get a more objective prove for yourself
    whether it works or doesn't work you have to observe the differences or
    similarities in reaction several times with different horses. You now know
    how the horses react on the Whiphlash treatment so it should be easy to
    compare that reaction to that of a picture treatment. And of course it is
    interesting for all of us to hear about the results so keep us posted.

    Thank you too Liselotte, for your enthusiasm and your input. Only if
    questions are shared we can clarify subjects.

Tumor in Anal Gland

LightworkLadyLightworkLady
April 2013 edited April 2013 in Animals Flag
Hi Johan
I have been treating Jake, my Labrador, as you had suggested with the
Carcinomas, Support for Kidneys and Bladder for his Tumors and also
used Glyoxal.   
Since then, he has developed a new one in his Anal Gland.....so I thought it's
a similar gland to the Tonsils and Appendix, so I added those remedies and
Periproctic Abcess....and support for the Spleen, Kidneys and Liver (his vet
has been giving him Acupuncture and she said those meridians needed
help.....she has seen improvement more quickly by adding light treatments than
she usually sees, so she has referred some animals to me!)  Jakes back legs are
starting to fail too....and often he doesn't realize that his hind legs have
collapsed and he tries to drag himself forward. I give him Whiplash treatments
down his Spine at least once a week...and treated with Nervoheel, Circulo,
Cerebrum, Neuroinjeel, Neuralgo Rheum.

I took him to the vet today and was disappointed to learn that his Tumor in his
Anal Gland has gotten larger.  Any suggestions?
He just turned 14 2 weeks ago, but still plays a lot and loves his walks....I
just don't want him to suffer at all....

    Hi Christina,
    I'm so sorry for your dog...

    Although the Acupuncturist might see more improvement with addition of the
    Chiren treatment. We usually experience the opposite from our perspective.
    Additional Acupuncture slows down the effects of Biontology... So I would
    not combine the two and just choose for the Chiren.

    Since none of the things you've tried have worked, I think you need another
    approach.
    Did you treat your dog for the Vaccinations he got? 
    The ones you can treat that are in the Chiren are:
    Leptospirose Canicola
    5th disease - Rubella works for this
    Rabies - Serum Ovile
    Canine Hepatitis - don't know which one in the Chiren resonates best...
    you'll have to try.
   
    I would also use:
    Tuberculinum Bovinum 
    Botulism
    Brucella Abortus Bang
    Viscum (very effective Cancer Remedy)

    This is what I would do for a first treatment. And then focus more
    specifically on the Tumor again, with Carcinoma Coli, Carcinoma Hepatis,
    Viscum, Selenium, Lymphomyosot and Liver Support.

    Galium, Pyrogenium, Colchicum are Supports I would think of when treating
    this Cancer.

    And of course some Kidney support...

    Hi Christina,

    I am a dog lover, and prior to biontology I had the sweetest dog. (He has
    since passed after a wonderful 14 years)  They thought he had a tumor in
    his anal gland or anal sac but they had me put warm compresses on his
    bottom and then squeeze gently. I know it sounds strange, but we did it and
    it did drain.  I see your dog has a history of other tumors too as did my
    dog, he had mast cell carcinoma, but this one drained and was not really a
    tumor and gave him great relief.
    It sounds like you are a really loving dog mama.  I too have treated
    several dogs.  It is so rewarding.

    Thanks so much Jan. I have to take him to the vet every 6 weeks to express
    his anals....since he has no hips, he can't scoot and self-express. A
    couple of times the past vets didn't do it correctly and they ruptured
    which was a nightmare....so this is his weak spot. The vet expressed him
    Wednesday, I would think that would have drained the tumor if it were
    possible.....I will try the compresses.....if he'll let me! I have used
    essential oils to get rid of his tumors in the past. Right now, my bigger
    concern is his back legs failing. He stubbornly refuses to use a
    ramp....and only begrudgingly allows me to help him get up into the car.
    I'm hoping the Chiren will provide some great results....as it does for so
    many clients.

    Hi Christina,
    Several reasons, but the most important one that counts for every
    additional energetic intervention....

    The Chiren measures and balances everything to an optimal state for that
    moment, so after a session everything is energetically OK. This is what you
    measure! So any energetic input you give thereafter is at best not
    disturbing that equilibrium (but won't have any effect then either) and at
    worst will disturb it again and hence disturb/block the bodies natural flow
    of healing that was just initiated...

    Another reason is that there's no self-controlling system like in the
    Chiren, so a client is always dependent on the skills of the Acupuncturist,
    who is never completely without thought and thus will do some projecting...
    (When you project in Biontology, there's always the light that corrects
    itself) Acupuncture is invasive and can really throw off someones balance
    if not done correctly and with the right mindset, which is focussed without
    thought. 

    Yet another reason is that Acupuncture is only part of Chinese Medicine. It
    moves energy, but in conditions that are really deep and chronic (which we
    often have to deal with) a Chinese Traditional Doctor would rather use
    herbs than Acupuncture. Because Acupuncture is easier to learn and shows
    fast effects (symptom treatment) in the West this got most attention, but
    Acupuncture is a stripped version of a complete medical system.
    (Herbs also give new impulses to the body and are not good in combination
    with the Chiren either!!!)

    After following the protocol recommended by Karolina, the tumor's growth
    rate is slowed from 90% to 17% after 3 treatments.

    I read one of the threads that said, "do not over treat." What shall I do
    now with this dog? Wait and see if the immune system is awake and will
    reverse and shrink the tumor, or continue to treat once a week? Or every
    other week.

    Any thoughts on this?

    I don't want to exhaust his immune system with too much info. He looks

Chikey Cards

Satya OrionSatya Orion
May 2015 edited June 2015 in General Questions Flag
A former client has just purchased a Chikey. He will be travelling for 2 weeks
and has asked me to make several Chikey cards for him.

1. What remedies would you suggest for the travel card? Should this card be
used after travel only? Or should it be used before travelling as well - and if
so, how best to do this?

2. I have treated him in the past for Melanoma, which I know is still active.
Would it be useful to make a second
card that included one of the skin cancer nosodes, plus support remedies? The
melanoma always gets worse when he flies.

3. What remedies would you recommend for a general support card? Or would
treating with the light alone be best for maintenance, in the absence of
measurement?

    Traveling is always bad for tumours. There is so much radiation in the air
    that normally tumours will grow as an effect.

    Answers
    1. I would only use the Travel card AFTER the trip. This card should
    include Causticum in order to try to neutralise the effects of the
    radiation. What I would put on a card that can be used BEFORE is remedies
    that strengthen the aura only, like Ozaliet

    2. In treating cancer one should always concentrate on the causes of the
    tumour.
    If the melanoma is still active this means that the cause is also still
    present.
    You can make a card with the melanoma nosodes and perhaps some general
    support. But without measuring I cannot advise on what kind of support
    remedies.

    3. A general support card would include remedies like:
    Selenium, Berberis, Solidago, Lymphomyosot, Nux Vomica, Viscum,Thalamus,

    Regarding the preprogrammed Chikey cards, I was told EMF-Less could be used
    before travel by plane, and Jet-Lag after a flight. Is this correct?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    May 2015 Flag
    No this is not right. It is also not desirable to treat two times within
    one or two days, which would be necessary.

    Both cards are created to treat with after exposure. The remedies
    themselves do not work preventative. Bringing the body in balance by
    measuring and treating specifically, however, does bring more resistance to
    withstand stress (e.g. radiation, time difference, infections)
     
    So preferably you should give a normal treatment with the Chiren a couple
    of days before the journey so the client is balanced and can withstand more
    stressors, and then right after the flight the Jet-Lag or EMF-Less card can
    be used.

    The cards also have many of the same remedies.

    3 day is the minimum. It depends on his condition, but if he is in
    relatively good condition this is OK. You can advise him to use either
    program 1 or 2 with the card.

    ongoing basis to be effective is always a suppressant. This kind of
    "treatment" is only an alternative if you have decided to give up finding
    the Cause, because it will always interfere with self-regulation.
    Suppression is never part of Biontology.

    About your current health situation:
    When the Pituitary and Thyroid still drop, this means you haven't found the
    Cause yet. 

    Can you tell me more about your situation, your measurements, remedies
    used, frequency of treatments, conclusions etc.?

    The Thyroid disturbance can be caused by the disturbed Pituitary. So what
    is disturbing the Master Gland? That is a very important question that you
    need to answer.
    Of course there can also be other causes for the Thyroid to drop apart from
    the disturbed Pituitary.

    Often returning Pituitary drops are caused by an ongoing exposure to a
    source of volatile Toxins like for example Formaldehyde?
    But also Chronic Tonsillitis and Acute/Chronic/Necrotic Appendicitis can
    disturb the Pituitary.

    Does the Pineal Gland drop regularly too? Because this might be another
    cause for a disturbed Pituitary Gland.

    Another thing to consider is severe dental/jaw problems…

    But without more information it is hard to give advise.

    I had difficulty at first downloading the Chikey program. I used the same
    memory stick that I had used to update my Chiren. It was not until I used
    the program that I had downloaded into my laptop as opposed to my desktop
    (I have both Macs) that it worked. So you may want to try loading your
    memory stick from a different computer. It makes no sense but it worked.

    No this is not correct. You must run the dyslexia program, and it is OK to
    hold the rod, but not as effective. The Dyslexia programme repeat the 2-7
    program a number of times.

    Yelyena:
    The 2-7 Year Program is the same as the Dyslexia Program, only shorter like
    you say. 
    However, they are both available on the Chikey. You would have to start
    Program 2 several times to get the same time laps as the Dyslexia
    Program.... Why would you want to do that?
   
    Peter:
    We always run the Dyslexia Program through the feet because this is how you
    most effectively reach the head. It is OK to hold the rods during this
    program too, but I personally advise clients to do it the way Sylvia
    described it.

May 2015 - Selenium and Hypertension

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
May 2015 edited May 2015 in Q&A Flag
Question
I seem to remember, vaguely, that you warned about using Selenium with
hypertension, as to the possibility of making the hypertension worse, I guess,
since the potassium would put more undue pressure on the Kidneys. Now as I
think, maybe Johan was referring to a person with poor Kidney function,
therefore the use of the Selenium may be stressing the Kidney.
I would like to know if there is a problem with using selenium as a support in
the case of hypertension.

Answer
When using Selenium as a support, high blood pressure in itself is not so much
a concern, but calcification and weak veins are.

The Potassium you give to the body with the Chiren is information and not the
actual physical substance. You can never increase the Potassium burden on the
Kidneys by using Selenium in treatment, even if the remedy contains low potency
Potassium. Informational remedies given with the Chiren will only be accepted
and used by the body when there is an actual need for it. If a remedy will
cause an extra imbalance it is filtered out immediately.

However, what I did warn about is stimulating the Adrenals when there is high
blood pressure combined with weak calcified blood vessels. The Adrenals may be
in need of Potassium and thus ready to accept Selenium Homaccord as a remedy,
but a better Adrenal function and consequential increased circulatory strength
may increase the pressure on the weak and rigid vessels with the risk of
internal bleeding.

    I am still confused.  When you say that the remedy, Selenium will 'never
    increase the potassium burden on the kidneys' and "Informational remedies
    given with the Chiren will only be accepted and used by the body when there
    is an actual need for it." - this seems to negate the next paragraph which
    warns about stimulating the adrenals when the blood pressure is due to
    calcified vessels.  Besides a Parathyroid dysfunction, what else will tell
    us that the vessels are calcified aside from a lab report.  Further, adding
    supports like Testis, Aletris or Tonico would seem to be poor choices in
    the calcified cases. 
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    May 2015 Flag
    Potassium burden on the Kidneys = chemical. There can be too much potassium
    salt in the blood, and this needs to be excreted by the Kidneys.
    Stimulating the Adrenals = functional. Without adding actual potassium salt
    to the bloodstream, the Adrenals will work better when Selenium (potassium)
    is given energetically. 

    To assess weakness of vessels, apart from measuring the Circulation/Veins
    meridians, I am always very much aware of reported/observed symptoms like:
    spider veins, hemorrhoids, bruising easily, past hemorrhages, petechiae
    etc. 

    As far as the following is concerned "Informational remedies given with the
    Chiren will only be accepted and used by the body when there is an actual
    need for it.".... 
    The body is a complex system of cooperating organ systems and every system
    has it's own needs. When you measure Selenium somewhere there is a need for
    it and the body will accept it. Another thing you should consider is that
    even when an organ system is not optimal all other systems still create a
    relative balance that makes things work with this defective organ. The
    relatively low action of the Adrenals may just be what keeps weak veins/
    arteries "safe". Raising blood pressure will disturb this relative balance.
    So if you measure a need for Selenium on the Adrenals, for sure the adrenal
    action will improve after treatment. It is just what the Adrenals needed,
    so this is not filtered out. But as a whole the body is not ready yet to
    have better functioning Adrenals if the vessels are too weak.
   
    Mind that these are rare situations, but very important to be aware of and
    to be consciously gentle. Biontology is a holistic modality and every
    aspect needs to be observed and integrated in assessment and treatment with
    the Chiren.
  •

    I take from this: If there is a weak vasculature as well as the adrenals,
    and you treat for the adrenals with Selenium you, most likely will see low
    Adrenals again next sessions, since the body will adjust to the need for
    less Adrenal strenght. At least this may be one possible scenario.  Thank
    you

    Dog:
    Rescue dog

    Symptoms:
    Severe dry skin
    Itching 
    Thickened skin due to over stimulation 
    I clean his ears every morning and usually it takes about 20 QTips cotton
    tip applicators to help remove the green pus from his ears. 

    Medication:
    All vaccinations => totally over-vaccinated

    Vet Assessment:
    Food allergies => this is a standard vets use when they fail with
    conventional drugs.
    The dog eats fresh rabbit now which seems the best for his energy, but he
    still has the skin problem.

    Chiren Treatment before:
    Insecticides and Heavy Metals => without effect
    I use the Chiren weekly with minor help => I could only conclude that his
    immunity is so compromised by the vaccines.  

    Yesterday's Treatment:
    Cutis, Graphites, Melanosarkonium, Schwefheel, Reneel, Populus, Vaccininum 
   
    Results:
    Dog slept soon after, scratching down to 80%.  
    Today his outer, crusted skin is falling off, some of the skin looks
    wrinkled, old, black and dry, elephant skin like.  
    Today it took only four QTips to clean out his ears.  
   
    Maybe we are getting somewhere now....

Hot Flashes

Irina
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Symptoms Flag
We learned that main cause for the hot flashes is Gall Bladder problem. Could
Thyroid imbalances and hysterectomy be also the factor ?
I have some clients in mid 50-th with the main complaints of hot flashes.

    The main cause for hot flashes is not Gall Bladder, but Hormonal Problems. 
    Thyroid, Adrenals, Hypothalamus.... Female Reproductive System they can all
    be a cause.

    I am sorry, of course the Gall Bladder is not the main cause.

    I found with few women that after balancing their Hormonal System and after
    clearing their Gall Bladder, only after that, their menopausal symptoms
    went away.

    Now I have one lady (56 years old). She has Hyperthyroid. Her Uterus and
    both Ovaries were removed. She is wearing estrogen patch. Without the patch
    she has a lot of hot flashes. 
    Could Chiren therapy help her?

    After trying all the remedies from protocol for balancing the Thyroid what
    would be likely the next disturbances to try?

    Thank you Irina, that's the way to go when your question starts moving
    slowly to the bottom of the list without being answered ;-). We had some
    very busy days around the Refresher Course in the Netherlands...

    When organs are removed that play a big role in Hormonal Production it is
    an unnatural body you have to work with. This is a structural problem that
    would need a miracle to be undone (growing a Uterus and Ovaries back). It
    might be impossible to completely restore Self-Regulation in this case. But
    of course you can treat for everything else and see if things start to
    shift anyway... 

    In an unnatural situation, sometimes unnatural measurements need to be
    taken, so I wouldn't take her patches away. How else would she otherwise
    get the needed hormones? And maybe I would even add Progesteron creme or
    patches. 

    Note that this advise is an exception due to the absence of these organs. I
    would never advise to use anything in a complete body.

    Hormones have a lot of influence on bile-flow. Estrogen reduces bile-flow
    and Progesteron stimulates it. Both hormones are lacking and the only one
    that is supplemented is Estrogen.... I would think this can create a lot of
    problems for the Liver and Gallbladder, so I would focus on these systems.
    And of course on the Thyroid.

    Hope this helps a little bit.

    Thank you for asking that because I have a number of women who have had
    their ovaries removed ask that question should they stay on the patches or
    bio-identical homemones.

    I understand the ovaries produce estrogen and when they are removed the
    estrogen production stops, so I have wondered this ... when we measure the
    hormone point for the sexual glands on the right hand and it says they want
    either ovarium or testes, in this case, can we measure both and give them
    both?   And, what is ovarium? Is it estrogen?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    April 2013 edited April 2013 Flag
    Ovarium is a Compositum (as is Testis). It consists of many remedies for
    the female reproductive system.

    "Contains the information of healthy ovaria, uterus, fallopian tubes and
    pituitary gland (although some in D10 potency, which Johan considers not
    very effective). The other remedies ared directed at all possible hormonal
    dysfuntions, functional disturbances and inflammatory conditions of the
    female reproductive system.

    Indicated for all menstrual problems, infertillity, menopause,
    osteomalacia, Cushing’s syndrome when caused by the pituitary gland,
    exhaustion in women and incontinence in young girls."


    I'm sorry, but don't understand the other question. What do you mean by
    measuring and giving Testis and Ovarium both in this case? 
  • 
    janjan
    April 2013 edited April 2013 Flag
    Thank you for your answer. 
    To address your question... a woman, with functioning ovaries but that may
    measure for/need ovarian support, but she may also have a debilitating
    disease and may measure for needing Testis for increasing muscle ( such as
    most ALS people do) or the Testosterone balance may be off due to the
    Ovarian problem then, could they not measure for and need both Ovarium and
    Testis?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    April 2013 edited April 2013 Flag
    Yes of course it is possible to test for both.

    Although Testis and Ovarium are mainly used as supports and hormonal
    problems are usually corrected in treatment with the nosodes just like
    other problems. 

    When the testosterone balance is off due to ovarian problems Ovarium is
    still the right support, I think. It is created especially to address any
    imbalance of the female productive system. Hormeel can also be used.

    Testis like you mentioned has many components to give extra strength to the
    body, which can be helpful in both men and women in debilitating diseases.

Asthma and Intestinal Pain

liselottewliselottew
June 2015 edited September 2015 in Symptoms Flag
Client:
Woman 34, who works in healthcare and has a sick daughter and husband

Symptoms:
Pain in the Large Intestine (end)
Stuffy nose => since 4 years, almost gone now
Lower backache => almost gone now
Intestinal symptoms => Cramping, Gas, Constipation and Pain
Nausea
Sore throat
Acne around the mouth => appeared recently
Asthma => much better, sometimes symptoms in the evening 
Sweaty hands and feet 

Previous Sessions:
Several treatments that were focused on Large Intestines, Lymphatic System,
Lungs
I did not know that I could treat for Appendicitis more than once after a
removed Appendix. I was trained by a Norwegian teacher who said that in case of
a removed Appendix I should only treat it once energetically to remove the
disturbance. Very good to get to learn that this was incorrect. 

Medical Interventions:
Removed Appendix => at age 10 
Nasal surgery => bones removed to make breathing easier (she had a blocked
nose)

Medical drugs:
Acid reflux tablets => stopped when symptoms disappeared by treatment
Asthma inhaler => needed less 
Penicillin => 10 courses for stuffy nose (did not help)

1st Measurement (dried hands off with towel):
Large Intestine (R+L) - 3 points => Appendicitis Necroticans (!)

>12 Years Treatment:
Appendicitis Necroticans, Atropinum, Viscum, Plumbum, Berberis, Chelidonium,
Nux Vomica

2nd Measurement:
Large Intestines (R) - 2 points => Chronic Appendicitis

Footplate Treatment:
Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis, Glyoxal, Diarrheel, Mucosa, Lymphomyosot,
Hepar, Selenium

Questions: 
1. Is it not odd that the Tonsils are not dropping considering the symptoms? I
have treated Lungs and Tonsilitis in the past together, but back then I did not
know that I could treat with the Appendicitis remedies more than once in case
of a removed Appendix.

2. Do you have any recomondation for the treatment? 

3. There where few drops on the first measurement so I added the supports to
possible lower endorphins. Is that ok, or incorrect too?

    Answers:
    1. The stuffy nose and the sore throat could also be caused by the Stomach
    system or Bladder system, more likely the Stomach. A number of symptoms are
    definitely caused by the Gallbladder (gas, cramping).

    2. The Constipation is likely caused by the lack of the Intestinal Flora in
    the Intestine. But Gallbladder and Kidneys may also be involved as bile
    stimulates peristalsis and a lack of water in the feces also cause
    constipation.

    3. After so many treatments and without any known reason for it, it is
    highly unlikely that there is an endorphin problem and thus adding remedies
    to lower endorphin is useless. The few drops are more likely a result of
    difficulty in measuring because of the sweaty hands.

    Yes I will look for Galbladder and Stomach drops next time.

    Further Questions:
    1a. How can the stuffy nose be caused by the Stomach or Bladder meridian? I
    don't understand, could you explain?
    1b. She has pain at the end of the Large Intestine by the hip. Is it not
    possible that this pain is caused by inflammation? The Appendicitis nosodes
    did match the proximal points on her Large Intestine meridian on the right
    hand.

    2. She has alternating constipation and loose stools. This is a symptom of
    Appendicitis, right?
    But lately after using Appendicitis nosodes she is a little constipated.
    Does this mean anything?

    3. Is it important to specify the change in a symptom due to treatment
    (e.g. with a certain nosode) when posting a question, or is it enough to
    just mention the symptom as long as it is there?

    5. Do Symptoms and Measurements make sense?
   
    6. Today her hands and feet were almost dry, but after the Hand Treatment
    her hands got sweaty again, but not her feet though. What could be the
    reason for this? 
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    July 2015 Flag
    Answers:
    1a. The Bladder and Stomach meridian run over the location of the Sinuses
    and thus can affect their mucous membranes and cause a stuffy nose or even
    nasal allergies.
    Another reason is that the Stomach meridian is connected to the jaw, and
    dental an jaw problems also affect the Sinuses. Food Poisoning can also
    cause cold symptoms like a stuffy nose.
    1b. Yes it can, but a more common reason for the pain is gas that is
    trapped in the Large Intestine. The pain may also be caused by the
    Gallbladder meridian.
   
    2. If there is a constipation after using the Appendicitis nosodes, the
    constipation is likely caused by the lack of healthy Intestinal Flora.

    3. Yes, it is important to mention any change in symptoms, whether they
    might be caused by nosodes or whatever else. The change can indicate many
    things and in order to provide a useful answer we need as much information
    as is available

    C. Do you have any further recommendation for treatments?

    A. Nausea can be caused by anything that affects the Stomach. 
    The Liver/Gallbladder system may be the cause, but also other disturbances
    in the digestive system. The mucous membranes in the Stomach and Intestines
    may be affected by something. 
    Another possible cause for the "intolerance" of alcohol is the Jaw
    infection, because the Jaw also influences the Stomach meridian.
    B. Yes, it does. But repopulation of healthy Intestinal Flora does not mean
    it all goes perfect after just one treatment. Sometimes one needs two
    treatments (after there are no other affections of the Intestines anymore)
    C. Focus on the Jaw.

    Update
    She has been on holiday, and had a break from treatments 

    Improved Symptoms:
    Stomach gas => gone
    Constipation => gone

    Symptoms: 
    Tooth decay => one cavity that was so bad it almost needed a root canal 
    Swollen gums
    Chipped molar => still needs to be fixed
    Nausea
    Nasal congestion
    Asthma
    Lower back pain => mornings and some evenings
    Belching => sometimes, increased a bit now
    Melasma
    Swollen Large Intestines
    Cold left ankle => twisted her ankle frequently as a child (I gave a local
    whiplash treatment)
    Pain on Large Intestines meridian (on the hand) 
    Cold on left ankel some times
   
    Repeated Scar Treatment:
    Appendix surgery
    Nasal surgery

    1st Measurement:
    Large Intestine => Appendicitis Necroticans, Chronic Appendicitis,
    Appendicitis
    Lung => corrected by nosodes above
   
    >12 yrs Treatment:
    Appendicitis Necroticans, Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis, Mucosa,
    Chelidonium, Diarrheel, Glyoxal, Nux Vomica
   
    2nd Measurement:
    Large Intestine => Diverticulose, Bact Coli
    Small Intestine => Gastritis
   
    Footplate Treatment:
    Diverticulose, Bact Coli, Bact Lactis, Bact Proteus, Bact Pyo, Gastritis,
    Duodenitis, Ulcus Ventriculi, Ulcus Duodeni
   
    Explanation of my Treatment Approach: 
    I used a lot of nosodes, but I only measured 6 of them, the other nosodes
    were chosen for support in line with my focus (Large Intestine and Small
    Intestine). I chose to use Ulcer nosodes, because of the burping and gum
    disease.
    My understanding is that a similar approach is advised when 1 Intestinal
    Flora Bacteria is found, because then the other 3 bacteria are also used
    and counted as supports...
   
    Questions
    1. What is the cause of melasma
    2. Do the symptoms and measurements match?
    3. Are the Small Intestine also connected to the gums? I did not find any
    drops on the Stomach (Jaw)
    4. I used Ulcus Duodeni and Ulcus Ventriculi as support, since ulcers can
    affect the gums. Is this right according to you?
    5. Is it OK to use Ulcus Duodenis, Ulcus Ventriculi and Duodenitis as
    support remedies when Gastritis is measured on the Small Intestine?

    1. Melasma is a pigmentation problem. Generally pigmentation issues are
    caused by the Pineal gland. 
    2. The symptoms do not match the measurement at all. There should be drops
    on many more meridians (e.g. 
    Lymphatic System, Stomach, Gallbladder). Are you sure you are not pressing
    too much?
    3. Gum disease is linked to the Stomach meridian. I have not seen it as a
    Small Intestine issue.
    4 & 5. I would not use the Ulcer nosodes as support. If you need support
    for ulcers, I suggest using Erigotheel, Nux Vomica, Duodenoheel,
    Gastricumheel.

    The balance between support remedies and nosodes is indeed missing as is
    suggested by Peter and Stefano. Support remedies have a broad spectrum
    supportive action that is very different from the action of nosodes. You
    need to use support remedies to assist the body in healing the causes that
    are targeted by the nosodes.

    Support remedies are listed on page 145 of the manual.  Nosodes are listed
    in Karolina's book right at the beginning thru page 137.

    Page 18 of Karolina's book explains the difference between nosode,
    homaccords, compositae and flower remedies.

    Today's session

    Symptoms: 
    Lower Back pain (5-8am) => almost no pain for 3 days => then more pain
    Swollen Large Intestine=> comes and goes
    Constipation => several days after last treatment 
    Pain in Large Intestine 
    Stool => alternating loose and hard
    Left Foot => painful after local whiplash treatment (last session), but it
    was painful before sometimes
    Dental pain => cold sensation => moves upward to the sinuses 
    Gums => not swollen
    Tired between 2pm and 5pm (Bladder time) => possibly Intestinal Flora
    infection
    Nervous energy
    Burping => stopped
    Asthma => comes and goes
    Skin breakouts => around the mouth => new symptom

    1st Measurement:
    Large Intestine => Appendicitis Nercoticans, Chronic Appendicitis,
    Appendicitis
    Lungs => Tuberculinum

    >12 yrs program:
    Appendicitis Nercoticans, Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis,
    Tuberculinum, Bact Coli, Bact Lactis, Bact Proteus, Bact Pyo

    2nd Measurement:
    Large Intestine => Diverticulose

    Footplate treatment:
    Diverticulose, Mucosa, Diarrheel, Glyoxal, Selenium, Chelidonium, Solidago

    Comments:
    As written in my other post, I try to press very lightly, the measurement
    curve on the Chiren does not go above half the screen and the lines are
    straight - so I think I am using the same pressure. The hole probe is
    towards the skin, and I measure where the sound is the highest. I do not
    know what other things to adjust to get right measurements.

    Regarding answer 3, I was thinking the wrong way. I do not understand why I
    do not find drops on the Stomach meridian, when she has cold sensitivity in
    different teeth that moves upward into the sinuses. She has no swollen gums
    though. She will make another appointment with her dentist so he/she can
    have a look at her teeth again.

    Questions
    1. What symptom that she has is caused by the Lymphatic System? (ref. your
    answer 2)
    2. Is it possible that the Stomach and Gallbladder will show after the
    Large Intestine improves?
    3. The cold sensitivity in her teeth should show up on her Stomach-Jaw
    point, right? 
    4. When I used Ulcus Ventriculi and Duodeni as a support to the Duodenum,
    because I found Gastritis there, I was thinking adding some nosodes would
    be OK since it was within the focus of treatment and thus would count as a
    support (I also wanted to make sure that I did not miss any ulcers).
    The reason I thought this is OK is because when I was treating my dental
    issues and found Kieferostitis, you mentioned that adding Granuloma Denti
    would not be a problem and would even count as a support to what was going
    on in my mouth, because it focussed on the same problem.
    Was I thinking the wrong way?

    1. The stuffy nose (nasal congestion) is a symptom that you should be able
    to measure on the Lymphatic System.

    2. Perhaps, but the Stomach and Gallbladder are yang organ systems and they
    normally do not suppress. IF they suppress, it means that they are in a
    terrible condition.

    3. The cold sensitivity indicates that there is something wrong with the
    teeth, therefore this should indeed show up on the Jaw point.

    4. Considering the symptoms, it is right to suspect possible ulcers. So
    using these nosodes because you are not certain of your measurements is ok,
    and it may very well be what stopped the burping. However, in such a case,
    you would count them as a nosode, not as a support. The same is true for
    Granuloma Denti when used along with Kieferostitis. What I meant when I
    told you that this could be counted as support, is that it would not divert
    attention away from your systems of focus.

    To avoid future confusion, rather than calling this "support", we can call
    these additional remedies "supportive nosodes". They are supportive because
    they do not distract from the focus we choose, but they should not replace
    the Homaccords and Compositae, that are very much needed to assist the body
    after causes have been addressed with nosodes. 

    Further advice 
    I cannot say anything about your measurements without observing what you
    do. 
    The only thing I can think of that might be true for you too, is that some
    people tend to correct unconsciously for a drop. So a straight line does
    not necessarily mean a stable measurement. 

    But maybe it is not your measurement technique that is the problem. It is
    always hard to say. The main thing is that you learn to observe when a
    measurement is conflicting with the symptoms and thus is unreliable for
    proper assessment. When this is the case you need to use your detective
    skills even more than usual. The more experience you get with people that
    follow normal patterns, the better you will be able to distinguish unusual
    situations that need a different approach. This is why it is good to see
    many different clients (and especially people who are not close to you)
    when learning Biontology. 

    Regarding your treatment approach, I focus on treating the Large Intestine
    and Gallbladder. Treating with Intestinal Flora is unnecessary because
    there is no indication for it. Only if you find an infection on the Kidneys
    /Bladder with one of the Flora Bacteria, you should treat with all 4 of
    them, but there were no points dropping on Kidneys/Bladder.

    Request
    Please, in the future, indicate if points are dropping on the left or right
    meridians. This is relevant information that helps with the assessment.

    2. She has had these symptoms for over 10 years, so I guess it possible
    that they are in terrible condition?
    3. The cold sensitivity of her teeth is gone now. I did not measure the Jaw
    point on the Stomach meridian, and I also didn't treat with Dental nosodes.
    This is very strange...
    4. Yes, that is what I mean, and I will call it that in the future since it
    makes it more clear to other readers.

    Response to further recommendations
    A. Is there anything that you can recommend to someone who corrects
    unconsciously for drops to improve measurement results?

    B. Quote: "If the measurement is conflicting with the symptoms and thus is
    unreliable for proper assessment. When this is the case you need to use
    your detective skills even more than usual."
    How do I use my detective skills even more?

    C. The people I have problems getting cleared, all have very bad
    Appendicitis. Other clients I treated with matching symptoms and
    measurements are clear now and the symptoms gone. Maybe I had problems
    getting these people well because I had some misunderstandings around
    Appendicitis. I am very happy to have learned some new things.
    * Before I did not understand that I should keep the Appendicitis nosode in
    de slot if it improves the drops even a little bit, and then continue to
    measure with Chronic Appendicitis. I have always searched for just one
    nosode to make the point perfect.
    * I have also learned in class that, when the Appendix was removed, the
    Appendicitis nosode only needed to be used once to cancel out the energetic
    disturbance. Because of this, I never measured for Appendicitis a second
    time when people had appendectomies.

    D. I still treat with the Intestinal Flora Bacteria because I still measure
    Appendicitis Necroticans, and thought that this always causes the bacteria
    to infect other places. Is my understanding incorrect then?

    Today's Session
    New Information:
    Surgical removal of nose polyps => 3 years ago (given local treatment in
    the past)
   
    Symptoms:
    Large intestine => better => less swollen => still some pain => no gas
    Stool => consistency changed (from loose to a bit hard) => difficulty
    passing stool
    Lungs => burning sensation => 3rd day after treatment => duration 1 day
    Flu symptoms (nose, tonsils, lungs) => 3rd day after treatment
    New pain (Bladder meridian) => neck and shoulder => mirrored on the front
    of the body (Gallbladder? hard to tell) 
    Cold sensitivity of teeth => gone (no other symptoms of jaw/teeth)

    1st Measurement:
    Kidney (L+R) => Bact Lactis
    Large Intestine (L+R) => Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis, Diverticulose
    Lung (L+R) => Tuberculinum
   
    >12 yrs Program:
    Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis, Diverticulose, Bact Coli, Bact Lactis,
    Bact Proteus, Bact Pyo, Tuberculinum
   
    2nd Measurement:
    Large Intestine (R) => Polypus Laryngis
   
    Footplate Treatment:
    Polypus Larynges, Polypus Nasalis, Tuberculinum Bovinum, Diarrheel,
    Erigotheel, Nux Vomica, Mucosa, Solidago
   
    Comments:
    I used Tuberculinum Bovinum as a supportive nosode, because I have measured
    Tuberculinum on her Lungs twice now.
    I used Polypus Nasalis as a supportive nosode, since she has removed polyps
    in her nose in the past and because I measured Polypus Larynges on her
    Large Intestine.
    So this makes a total of 6 measured nosodes and I used two supportive
    nosodes...

    Questions
    1. Can you comment on today's session? Was it OK or should I have done
    something different?
    2. Was it OK to add the supportive nosodes?

    It seems there are too many nosodes. We are taught to limit the nosodes to
    eight.  To use more nosodes, as if they are supportive is not the intention
    of the use, it would seem to me.  

    Maybe the confusion is that the Nosodes are being used in the Foot Plate
    section.  Just because a nosode is used in the Foot Plate doesn't make it a
    Support if it is a Nosode, so this may 'over treating' with too many
    nosodes.  

    I would use supportive nosodes when I suspect the need but my point
    measuring does not fit with symptoms, that is, when I am confused about my
    measuring but the symptoms call for these nosodes - and I would not use
    more than eight nosodes combined in the hand and foot part of the
    treatment. UNLESS flora is not considered a NOSODE, then all I've said is
    incorrect. 

    Nosodes:
    Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis, Divericulose, Bact. Coli, Bact. Lactis,
    Bact Proteus, Bact Pyo, Tuberculinum, Polypus Larynges, Polypus Nasalis,
    Tuberculinum Bovinum

    I believe that only the Bacterial Flora that is measured as correcting a
    drop is counted as a nosode. 
    In this case that would only be Bact Lactis, so the other 3 bacteria were
    added as support remedies, because this is indicated when you measure one. 
    This would add up to 8 nosodes in total...

    Comment to response 3. The Improvement of the cold sensitivity is hard to
    pinpoint, but never forget that you are treating with many remedies at the
    same time. In Chelidonium there is Belladonna, that acts on inflammation,
    mucosa also effects the gums.... But more importantly by improving on
    serious infections (e.g. Appendicitis Necroticans) in the body, the overall
    condition and immune function improves everywhere.
   
    Comment to response 4. You missed the point that this is an exception and
    can be done on one organ system that has special focus (e.g. adding
    Granuloma Denti if you measure Kieferostitis, and there are serious dental
    problems, but usually this reflected in measurement also). However, you
    should not add more than one nosode like this and take care that in
    combination with the other nosodes it does not exceed the normal limit for
    using nosodes (8).
   
    A. Don't care about the outcome, but focus on the measurement technique,
    especially on keeping the same level of pressure.

    B. You need to keep your overview, and look for correlations between
    symptoms, timeline, measurements, changes due to treatment etc. etc.
    Everything is a clue to what is going on with the client and to what is
    needed. Even a false measurement may be a clue to something. 

    C. The Appendix is what has been removed, not the whole intestinal tract.
    So only on the Appendix point itself you will find that a one time
    treatment is enough. The stages of Appendicitis can, however, still be
    measured on other intestinal points and on other organ systems.

    D. You only need to use the Intestinal Flora Bacteria if you measure that
    one or more is causing infection somewhere outside of the Large Intestine.

    Answers
    1. You mention: 
    Neck and shoulder pain => This indicates Stomach, Small Intestine, Large
    Intestine and Lymphatic problems
    Flu symptoms => This indicates Food Poisoning, this can also cause an
    Appendicitis flare up 
    Swollen Large Intestine => This indicates excess gas (that is trapped),
    which is a Gallbladder issue
    Yet, there are no drops on those meridians except for the Large
    Intestine...

    2. The use of the extra Flora Bacteria is OK, but they should still be
    counted as nosodes and not as support. You used them because you suspect
    infections, and not because you want to rebuild the Intestinal Flora (too
    soon). Fighting infections describes the nosode action of the Intestinal
    Flora Bacteria. So they definitely count as nosodes in this case.
    The problem with adding the other "supportive nosodes", is that this is a
    waste of much needed treatment space. Since these nosodes were not
    measured, I see no use in adding them. There is enough that needs
    focus. Supporting with Homaccords and Compositae is extremely important,
    and now you only used 5 supports against 11 nosodes. 
    One of the supports is Diarrheel (?), which I do not understand, since you
    mentioned that your client has difficulty passing stool, diarrhoea is the
    opposite.

    3. That is very educational. I will remember that. 

    4. Yes I think I better understand this. No more adding of supportive

    A. I guess I care to much and try to hard. I really want to help and give
    result. But it is hard to have a clear head, when I often think that I
    don't do anything right. And I feel more and more uncertain about my
    measurements, and I guess that affects me when I am measuring... 
   
    Question
    1. I just looked at the location of meridian where she had pain - it was on
    Galbladder or Bladder. How does the Lymphatic system effect that area? 
    Because there is a lot of lymphatic tissue located in the throat? 
    2. I asked and she said she has no gas, do you still think it is gas?
   
    I will look at this closer next treatment.

    Hi Liselotte, don't forget you are also doing many things right, and it is
    not said that it has to be your technique that makes the measurement
    unreliable in this case . It is, however, something that we need to
    consider as a possibility among the other possibilities that Johan
    mentioned.

    The last thing we want to do is make you insecure, but I understand that
    this is what automatically happens when discrepancies are pointed out
    regularly.
    Maybe if you realise that the reason you posted these cases on the forum is
    because you are struggling with them, you also realise that with others the
    measurements might very well have been ok. Possibly these clients are
    especially difficult to measure and in general you are having reliable
    measurements... only you can tell. Obviously you take your most difficult
    cases to the forum.

    What we can teach you and others here is to hone your skills as a
    detective, and distinguish a good measurement from an unreliable one
    (again, this should not be taken personally as it can have many causes and
    vary for each client).

    Telling a good measurement from a not so reliable one, is information that
    you can use.
    If, for example, you have someone with current issues that indicate the
    involvement of Large Intestine and the Kidneys, and there has been an
    appendectomy, which means appendicitis in the past, it is highly suspicious
    to not measure drops on the Large Intestine and Kidney meridians. With this
    knowledge, you can try to find why the measurements are false and see if
    you can correct this, and otherwise you can treat according to, what is
    very likely, the underlying cause (in this case Appendicitis Necroticans/
    Intestinal Flora).

    So what you say about "..no more adding supportive nosodes because I am
    uncertain of my measurement", is not right. Sometimes you may choose to add
    something that you did not measure, but which fits within the focus
    according to symptoms and the sequence of the protocol. The main thing to
    realise is that you should not overdose on nosodes, and that it is very
    important to give sufficient support by using compositae/homaccords.

    The choice of using Ulcus Ventriculi (session of September 21st), may very
    well have helped your client with her Stomach symptoms, so that was a good
    choice. But you did not just use this nosode but also Duodenitis and Ulcus
    Ventriculi. Because of this, there was not enough space anymore for proper
    support (compositae/ homaccords).

    What Johan meant by "don't care about the outcome", is not that you should
    not care about your client, but that in the moment of measuring, all of
    your focus should go to the technique and not to ideas of whether a point
    is/should be "bad" or "good". Some practitioners seem to have a preference
    for "good" and unconsciously correct a point when it is dropping, thus they
    are influencing the outcome in a "positive" way.

    A case that is posted on the forum is read as study material by many
    practitioners who all have different issues. For this reason we try to be
    as complete in answering questions as possible. I honestly cannot tell if
    your measurements are right or not. The only thing that we can observe from
    a posted case is whether the measurements make sense, but if they do not,
    we cannot see what the cause is. We only mention possibilities...

    I hope you won't get discouraged. The fact that practitioners are happy
    with this post means that they encounter similar problems sometimes.
    Everyone has clients they are struggling with...

    1. The combination of neck and shoulder pain is caused by the digestive
    system, and most commonly by food poisoning. When there is food poisoning
    there are also drops on the Lymphatic System.
    Also, just above the collarbone there are two big lymph nodes, but I need
    to ask Johan for more specific explanation about what he meant. 
   
    2. How does she know it is not gas? Swelling of the intestines is often
    caused by gas that is trapped. Other than having the symptoms that she has
    (bloating + pain), there is no indication for her to know whether it is gas
    or not.
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel

    Food poisoning can affect all mucous membranes. You should also look at the
    organs controlling particular muscles (manual). Pain can also be muscle
    pain like in the neck.
    There are Lymphatic vessels everywhere and mucous membranes everywhere, and
    these could be affected by all and everything.

    If you asked if she had gas and she said no, it probably meant that she did
    not burp and did not fart. That means that there was no expression of gas,
    but a swollen intestine is almost always trapped gas.

    2. I now understand that swelling and pain in the Large Intestine can be
    trapped gas (no farting), and this can be caused by the Gallbladder. I
    guess that pain in the Large Intestine alone can be caused by inflammation,
    but that when there is also bloating, this is because of trapped gas,
    caused by the Gallbladder.

    Today's Session

    Symptoms:
    Extreme pain in Large Intestine, bloating, constipation => 2nd and 3rd day
    after treatment, then it subsided.
    Nausea (Gallbladder ?) => comes and goes
    Burning sensation => whole Stomach area
    Nervous energy => somewhat improved
    Burning shoulder pain (Gallbladder?) 
    Stiff neck
    Left knee pain on right side => 6 days after last treatment (new symptom)
    Right knee pain (Kidney?) => around the whole knee
    Asthma => comes and goes => almost always around bed time (no spiral bed,
    asked to move her phone 2 meters away from the bed)
    Lower back pain => used to wake up with pain every morning => much improved
    => only mild pain one day
    Flu symptoms (nose and tonsil) =>gone
    Stuffed nose => comes and goes

    Pain correlations:
    Meridian correlation => Large Intestine (front), Gallbladder (back),
    Bladder, Small Intestine
    Muscle-Organ correlation => Bladder, Kidney, Heart, Lung, Stomach, Liver

    1st Measurement:
    Large Intestine (R) - proximal point => Polyp Larynges
    Small Intestine (L) => Salmonella Typhi
    Lungs (L) => Staphylococcen

    >12 Years Program:
    Polyp Larynges, Salmonella Typhi, Staphylococcen, Biliary Cirrhosis,
    Cholecystitis, Nux Vomica, Mucosa

    2nd Measurement:
    Gallbladder (L) - Gallstone point => Calculi Bil

    Footplate Treatment:
    Calculi Bil, Calculi Renalis, Chelidonium, Reneel, Atropinum, Solidago,
    Vomitusheel, Spascupreel
   
    I used two Gallbladder nosodes, because this was indicated by the symptoms,
    but I did not measure any drops on the Gallbladder meridian the first
    measurement.
   
    Questions
    1. What can give burning sensations in the whole Stomach area? It starts
    just below the ribs and covers the whole Stomach, Large Intestine and Small
    Intestine area.
   
    2. The total number of used of nosodes is 7:  Polyp Larynges, Salmonella
    Typhi, Staphylococcae, Biliary Cirrhosis, Cholecystitis, Calculi Renalis,
    Calculi Bil
    Is this OK, or should I have done something different? 
   
    3. Do my symptoms and measurements go better together? Any further
    recommendations?

    Today's Session
   
    Symptoms:
    She does not burp
    Stomach => less swollen
    Large Intestine, Small Intestine => less pain
    Stomach => still a burning sensation => acid burning after eating
    Nervous energy => reduced
    Nausea => gone
    Knees => pain gone
    Lower back => pain gone
    Shoulder => pain gone => only stiff/tired muscle now (Stomach connected to
    muscles)
    Constipation => same
    Asthma => same => mainly at 11 pm (bedtime), sometimes from 9 pm => rarely
    at other times
    Cold feet => always
    Cold hands => sometimes
    Coldness => evenings => starting at 7/8 pm when sitting down, watching tv
    => but she thinks it also may be that she notices the cold more when
    relaxing.
    Tiredness => today
    Nasal congestion => comes and goes

    1st Measurement:
    Large Intestine(R) - 1 proximal point => Appendicitis
    Stomach(R) - 3rd point from the nail => Granuloma Denti

    >12 yrs Program:
    Appendicitis, Granuloma Denti, Cholecystitis, Billiary Cirrhosis, Nux
    Vomica, Injeel-Chol, Chelidonium

    2nd Measurement:
    Gallbladder(L) => Adenomyose Gallenblase, Calculi Bil

    Footplate Treatment:
    Adenomyose Gallenblase, Calculi Bil, Calculi Renalis, Reneel, Atropinum,
    Berberis, Fel Tauri, Spascupreel (changed to Anacardium halfway)

    3rd Measurement:
    Liver(L) - 2nd point from nail => Zirrhose Hepatis

    I used 8 nosodes
    Many of her symptoms improved after the previous session, and since she
    still experiences Gallbladder symptoms I chose to add Gallbladder nosodes
    in the first treatment, even though the Gallbladder meridian did not drop.
    After this treatment, the Gallbladder started to drop.

    Questions
    4. Should I continue focusing on the Gallbladder/Liver, and keep measuring
    for Gallbladder or Liver nosodes on the Gallbladder?

    5. There seems to be a lot of suppression. Only after the second treatment
    the Liver showed up.
    I then treated the Liver because I thought the Liver may affect the
    Gallbladder and the Stomach. Was this the right decision?

    6. Because the Liver showed a drop now, does this mean that it stopped
    suppressing, and that I can rely on the measurements of Gallbladder and
    Liver next time? Or should I do something to lift suppression?

    7. Should I treat the Stomach or only focus on Gallbladder/Liver because
    they disturb the Stomach?

    8. I followed the measurement protocol when choosing nosodes to test with.
    Granuloma Denti matched on the Stomach drop, even though she has no dental
    symptoms. Does this mean that I should have used a different nosode?

    9. Because of the time of day that she experiences asthma, I figured that
    it may be caused by the Gallbladder condition. However, her asthma did not
    improve along with the other Gallbladder symptoms this week. Also, the
    Lungs are not dropping. Am I missing something?

    10. Any further recommendations?

    Answers
    1. It believe it is just gas that cannot get out. What did she eat?
   
    2. The number of nosodes is OK

    3. I believe there are not enough Gallbladder points dropping
    Stiff neck => indicates a Stomach issue, and the Stomach meridian is not
    dropping
    Burning shoulder pain => likely Intestines
    Knee pains => Kidney/Bladder 
    All of them are not dropping...
    So overall your measurements are not matching symptoms

    For the moment my advice is to focus on Gallbladder, Kidneys, and Bladder.

    4. I would continue to focus on the Gallbladder. The fact that it does not
    drop in the beginning shows extreme stress, because suppression hardly
    happens with the Gallbladder.

    5. No, it was not the right decision. You should have left the drops on the
    Liver, because the yang organs were not in order yet, and especially
    because extreme stress was indicated by the suppression of a yang organ
    (Gallbladder).
    Although you might be right that the Liver is causing the Gallbladder
    malfunction, it is still not right to treat the Liver at this stage. And a
    3rd treatment should also not have been done after the Footplate treatment.
    This is not part of the protocol.

    6. You have experienced that treating the Gallbladder stops suppression on
    the Gallbladder/Liver. You need to continue treating this way, even when
    the Liver shows more drops, ignore them until far more suppression is gone.
    There should be far more points dropping because many of the symptoms are
    still not reflected in the measurement. I suggest to continue with focus on
    the Gallbladder.

    7. I would not change the focus. Focus at this time should be Gallbladder
    (not the Liver).

    8. It was not the Jaw point that dropped on the Stomach meridian. I would
    try other things on this point, for example Food Poisoning nosodes or
    things like Ulcers or Gastritis.

    9. That this symptom does not improve after this session does not mean you
    have not treated correctly. Remember the Gallbladder is still suppressing,
    so there are far more things to be cleared. Only if it does not suppress
    anymore and you then get all balanced, you could expect results with the
    asthma.

    10. If you use Chelidonium, you don't need Fel Tauri as a support as well,
    because Fell Tauri is one of the components of the homaccord Chelidonium.
    So there was no need to switch remedies.
    I would not use Appendicitis on the proximal point on the Large Intestine.
    The reason for this point is normally Diverticulosis, Bact. Coli or
    Proteus.

    Today's Session
    This was 14 days after the last session, because there was no earlier
    possibility. 
   
    Symptom Improvement: 
    Nervous energy => almost gone
    Neck stiffness => improved, only a little bit now
    More energy in the evenings

    Other Symptoms:
    Less energy in the morning (tired)
    Stomach bloating/pain => increased
    Stomach burning/acid reflux => unchanged
    Constipation => unchanged since last week
    Stuffiness of the nose => increased
    Asthma (starting 9-11pm, not very often) => more frequently now, also at
    different times
    Cold feet => always
    Cold hands => sometimes
    Gallbladder meridian pain => Stomach area

    1st Measurement (low sounds due cold hand/feet):
    Stomach (L) => Campylobacter Pylori
    Gallbladder (L) => Calculi Billiaris
   
    >12 yrs Program:
    Calculi Bil, Calculi Renales, Campylobacter Pylori, Reneel, Atropinum, Nux
    Vomica, Injeel Chol, Chelidonium
   
    2nd Measurement (better sound/circulation):
    Stomach (L+R) => Leptospirose Canicola, Gastritis
    Gallbladder (L) => Billiary Cirrhosis
   
    Footplate Treatment:
    Leptospirose Canicola, Gastritis, Billiary Cirrhosis, Ulcus Ventriculi,
    Cholecystitis, Gastricumheel, Berberis, Solidago, Erigotheel 
   
    Comments:
    Ulcus Ventriculi and Cholecystitis were added as supportive nosodes,
    because I am not completely sure about my measurements. In total I used 8
    nosodes.

    Questions
    1. Can the stuffy nose be caused by Stomach infections (bacteria)?

    2. Is the treatment ok, or should I have done anything different?

    That's an interesting approach, to use your second measurement to choose
    more nosodes.

    November 2015 edited November 2015 Flag
    I was under the impression that, if possible, a drop should be corrected by
    a nosode first. My understanding is that it could be that more than one
    issue needs to be dealt with, or more layers...

    Comments
    Gallbladder meridian pain in the Stomach area is impossible, because the
    Gallbladder meridian does not run there. Did you mean pain on the sides of
    the abdomen?

    If the points on the same meridian still drop after a treatment, it
    generally means that the wrong nosodes have been used. During measurement
    they might have given the impression that they were going to work, but in
    the end they did not. I do not see a measurement after the foot plate
    treatment if the chosen nosodes then did work.
    Theoretically there could be more layers but generally not in the same
    session.
   
    Assuming the measurement was correct, when in the first measurement only
    the L Stomach drops and in the second measurement the L+R drop, this
    indicates that there is suppression on the that meridian... Not very
    common, and it would indicated a severe Stomach issue.

    Answers
    1. Anything wrong with the Stomach meridian can result in a nose problems

    2. I would not have chosen a Food Poisoning since I do not think this is
    the main problem. Food Poisoning also should show itself on the
    Intestines..

    Yes, that is what I meant, the sides of her abdomen.

    Questions
    1. The measurement after the footplates (3rd measurement), there were no
    drops. Does this mean that the nosodes I used on the footplate did work?

    2. Can problems of the Stomach meridian affect the sinuses and gums/mouth
    also? So that if the Stomach meridian is imbalanced, the gums are affected,
    which then spreads to the Sinuses?

    Today's Session

    Symptom Changes:
    Throat => dry sensation
    Stomach bloating => less severe, sometimes
    Stomach burning => gone
    Stomach/Gallbladder(?) region => short stabbing sensations
    Nervous energy => almost gone
    Neck stiffness => a little bit
    Asthma => improved, but still comes and goes
    Energy evenings => improved
    Pain Gallbladder meridian => gone 3 days after treatment (just some
    stiffness now)
    Constipation => unchanged
    Cold feet/legs => from knees down
    Cold => always
    Acid reflux sensation => coming and going => unchanged
    Tired => early morning
    Stuffy nose/sinuses => increased
    Pressure in sinuses => during footplate treatment

    Measurement:
    Small Intestine (R) => Brucellosis
    Lymphatic System (L) - sinus, ear point => Brucellosis
    Stomach (L) => Gastritis
    GallBladder (L) => Biliary Cirrhosis, Adenomyose Gallenblase

    >12 yrs Program:
    Brucellosis, Gastritis, Biliary Cirrhosis, Adenomyose Gallenblase, Injeel
    Chol, Chelidonium, Atropinum, Gastricumheel

    2nd Measurement:
    Stomach (L) => Ulcus Ventriculi

    Footplate Treatment:
    Ulcus Ventriculi, Veratrum, Erigotheel, Nux Vomica, Berberis,
    Cholecystitis, Mucosa, Solidago, Anacardium

    3rd Measurement:
    No drops

    Questions
    3. When following protocol, why do we test for Duodenitis and Ulcus Duodeni
    on the Stomach meridian, and Gastritis and Ulcus Ventriculi on the Small
    Intestine?

    4. I found Gastritis the 1st measurement, but the point was not corrected
    the 2nd measurement and then Ulcus Ventriculi matched. Could this be wrong
    measurement, or did the nosode match without having any effect? Or maybe it
    improved the drop, without completely solving it?

    5. Why is for Duodenitis/Ulcus Duodeni and Gastritis/Ulcus Ventriculi the
    less severe nosode first listed in the protocol? On the Large Intestine, we
    start measuring for Appendicitis Necroticans (most severe) first and then
    the less severe inflammations.

    6. What is acid reflux caused by?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    November 2015 edited November 2015 Flag
    Answers
    1. The nosodes then appear to have worked. Whether you use them on the
    footplates or in the hand treatment does not make any difference

    2. If the Stomach meridian is no good, then it affects the sinuses because
    of the location of the Stomach meridian. The Stomach meridian runs over the
    Sinuses. This is energetic. The mouth belongs to the Stomach system.
    The lymphatic systems in the head are all connected so the physical way to
    go from one system to the next is very easy.
   
    3. It is my experience that all 4 remedies can match both the Stomach and
    Small Intestine meridians. Just like Calculi Biliaris can also match the
    Kidney point and Calculi Renales can match the Gallbladder point. If
    Duodenitis or Ulcus Duodeni do not match on the Small Intestine, then I
    test for Gastritis or Ulcus Ventriculi.

    4. This was likely a false positive. This happens some times. In the
    measurement Gastritis matched but treatment does not do anything. It means
    that the chosen remedy was wrong. The second choice of Ulcer was a good
    choice.

    5. We have listed the nosodes in the sequence of what is most frequently
    found

    6. Acid reflux is caused by the Gallbladder

    Pain Gallbladder meridian => abdomen => same
    Cold sensitive teeth => cause is brushing too hard (according to dentist)
    Anger => less since last time

    1st Measurement:
    Small Intestine (L) => Brucella Abortus Bang, Salmonella Paratyphi

    Questions
    1. Should I stop treating until the cavities in her teeth have been filled?
    How does a cavity in a tooth effect the body and treatment? 
   
    2. Her symptoms did not improve, since last time. Could it be that the bad
    Liver holds the Gallbladder back from healing? Or might the dental cavity
    responsible?
   
    3. I measured many Food Poisonings on the Small Intestine. She says to
    clean her kitchen with Chlorine, so her kitchen should be very clean. Could
    these be old infections, or are they new?

    3rd Measurement:
    No drops

    Comment:
    On the Gallbladder all the same points dropped in the 2nd measurement as in
    the 1st measurement. This was a false positive I guess..

    Questions
    4. A lot of her Gallbladder and Liver (cold) symptoms have gotten worse.
    Why do you think this is? Is it because the body masks less (less stress /
    endorphins) now the Liver starts showing?

    5. Should I only measure for Liver nosodes on the Gallbladder the next
    Session?

    6. How do you view the overall session? I used 9 nosodes, but that is only
    because the Gallbladder gave a false positive, and Biliary Cirrhosis and
    Cholecystitis did not correct the drops. I hope that it was not to many
    nosodes...

    7. Any further recommendations?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    November 2015 edited November 2015 Flag
    Protocol!
    In the first place you should have left the Liver alone. This is still far
    too early looking at her symptoms.

    Answers
    1. No, there is no reason to wait treating when there is a dental cavity.

    2. If the dental cavity caused an infection in the Jaw(s), this may block
    healing. 
    I do not think (yet) it is the Liver that is holding things back.

    3. Knowing this I would also treat with Chlorum. I have no idea if the
    infections are old or new. Because you measure different Food Poisonings,
    they seem to be new. Her kitchen might be clean but are the cooking
    utensils, pots, pans, cutlery, knives, plates? And does she always eat at
    home? Does she eat left-overs?

    4. No, I think you missed the Large Intestine. She wakes up between 5-6,
    which is Large Intestine time as you have observed, I think it is
    Appendicitis (acute, chronic, or necroticans) and the resulting lack of
    Intestinal Flora might be the result of the Liver/Gallbladder problems, and
    therefore also of the Stomach problems. 
    DO NOT TREAT THE LIVER, even if it shows. You must take everything into
    consideration, that is Biontology.

    5. Forget about the Liver noses for the moment.

    6. & 7. The measurements do not match symptoms. There should be drops on
    Large intestine, and Stomach at least. Probably also drops on Kidney and
    Bladder. The night sweats indicate Kidney/Bladder problems. Treat with
    Appendicitis Necroticans, Intestinal Flora + Kidney/Bladder supports as
    well

February 2016 - Practitioner's Gathering

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
February 18 in Q&A Flag
Questions
Johan, these are more comments than questions, but something I hope that you
will address them in your remarks. I have also shared these concerns with Hakan
and asked that he include my comments at his gathering.

A. There is a gathering of practitioners being initiated by Hakan in April to
talk about the future of the "Biontology community". Is this something you are
aware of?

B. There is talk of sharing favorite remedies, and approaches to different
conditions and participating in a new Forum. 

C. I feel uneasy about all of this and am not going to be involved. It feels
there is quite a lot of potential to stray from the focus of protocol.

D. Are there any possible plans for the current Forum to be reopened, moderated
by a very experienced Certified Biontologist?


Answers
A. Yes, the invitation has been forwarded to me, but I was never consulted, so
it is an unofficial gathering and officially the word Biontology should not be
used, especially if this gathering is a get together of mostly non-members and
people who have not invested in learning and practicing actual Biontology.
On the other hand it can be an opportunity for those who did choose to become
Biontologists in the true sense of the word, to share their experience and
knowledge. This is actually what I intended to initiate. I hoped that you all
set up a professional organization that promotes real Biontology. But I got the
impression that there was no such intention in this case.

B. This shows clearly that what Karolina and I feared is already happening. A
new forum… managed by whom? Hardly anyone is on the level that they can even be
certified, and those who are certified are also aware that they are still
learning. They are in fact most humble. The ones who think they know it all,
and are promoting themselves in this way are the ones you have to be careful
of.
The Biontology forum has been a very intensive project of which the goal was to
answer all questions about Biontology without allowing any delusions or
diversions. This has proven to be the only way to keep people somewhat on
track. The desire to put one’s own stamp on things without any foundation of
understanding appears to be huge, and the danger of listening to these
unfounded ideas is, that most of you will forget where you got that information
from. In the past this has led to people blaming me for misinformation they
actually got from others, but they forgot.
So it is in fact necessary to keep things clean from pollution like this. IF
you want to learn Biontology -and most of you are really still in a beginner’s
stage of learning- there is enough information that you still have not mastered
and you can find it on the forum. Don’t skim over it and think you already
know, but concentrate and read what is actually written. It amazes me how many
times practitioners say: “I have followed protocol”, while they clearly did
not.
All of the mistakes I have seen, heard and read that practitioners make, should
not have been made if all that is on the forum and in the manual was studied an
incorporated in their practice. Implementing the protocol demands dedication
and effort. I understand that it is not easy. But the answer is not in
searching in different directions. All that you need to know is right in front
of you, and completely accessible to everyone who wants to study. So I am not
for this new forum idea at all, and I even warn you that it will not help you
to become a Biontologist. Unlearning what you have learned wrong is so much
more difficult than learning things right from the start. So exposing yourself
to false information is the biggest mistake you can make. The idea of sharing
“your favorite remedies” also shows that the focus of this gathering is not on
“what do and do we not understand about Biontology”, but about “there must be
more that we can get”. This is not promising for the start-up of what is called
the “Biontology community”. I believe the intention is right, but is the wrong
seed that is being planted.

C. Yes, you are completely right. And this is also my experience. It is not
something new that seems to be happening. It is history repeating itself. Maybe
it is inevitable. It seems to be what the majority of the people want… the easy
way. Focus is hard work, and straying is easy and entertaining.

D. The current forum will remain open for study access. Everything fundamental
has already been answered and repeated over and over again, and in many
different ways. So there is no need to have these same questions answered by
someone else again and again, with the danger that this someone else starts to
divert as has happened in the past. If misinformation starts to appear on this
forum, all that we have worked so hard for will be lost, as this misinformation
will again be linked with me and with Biontology. Everything on the Health
Angel forum is, in the eye of the reader, considered officially approved, so
mistakes can have a huge impact.
If a Certified Biontologist wants to start another forum, the requirement is
that it should provide Biontology education only, and that any misinformation
that is given in any comment is corrected right away. Getting rid of
misinformation and correcting mistakes should be done by Certified
Biontologists only, because only they have proven to understand Biontology. I
don’t think that any practitioner would like such a role, but if I am wrong, I
am happy to give my blessings to the Certified Biontologists who starts up such
a forum.

Thrombophlebitis - Vein Inflammation with Blood Clot Formation

Sylvia
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client: 82 y/o female who has been diagnosed with Thrombophlebitis 50 years
ago. She also is Diabetic, has a brain Aneurysm, complains of pain in her feet
from Callouses, and Arthritis.  The Thrombophlebitis was diagnoses at the time
when her daughter was born.

Remedies:
I am treating her with Barijodeel and Aesculus since they both match every
session. I presented this case to Johan in class and now understand why
Barijodeel may take 8 treatments or so to help dissolve Calcification in
Veins. 

Question:
The client's mother is a physician and her question is... if the calcification
in her veins is dissolved, then what will keep the Thrombophebitis from then
moving the clot and ending in her lung and causing death? 
I explained that the treatment will be helping to dissolve the clot so it won't
be an issue. Is this the correct answer? One of her treatments the Barijodeel
cleared every single point that had dropped and I only ran Barijodeel in the
hand treatment. It was very interesting to me.  

She has drops in Pancreas (both hands), Veins, Circulation, Gallbladder.

    Pancreas are feet

    1. With the Pancreas points on the hands, Sylvia probably means the Insulin
    points which are on the hands

    2. The Thrombophlebitis is caused by too thick blood, with too much
    Thrombocytes in relation to the amount of blood. It might be that there is
    too little fluid in the blood (if the client does not drink enough water),
    or that the production of Thrombocytes is too high. This production is
    under control of the Gallbladder. Since this has been measured too,
    treatment of the Gallbladder is essential at the same time. Treatment of
    the Gallbladder might also lead to relaxation of the blood vessels.
    Treating clots is a tricky thing though...

    3. The Gallbladder is definitely the cause of the Diabetes so the
    Gallbladder is the cause of many of the client's symptoms.
    The diabetes condition also is not very beneficial for the condition of the
    blood vessels. The right remedy for this is Syzygium.

    4. The Arthritis is probably caused by the under functioning Kidneys, which
    is likely caused by the Adrenals. This in turn is responsible for the
    Gallbladder problems.
    To treat this: people must stop using all diuretics( coffee, tea, alcohol
    and sodas and eat a lot of potassium rich food (avocados, bananas, yams,
    sweet potatoes). You must treat the Gallbladder at the same time. The
    increase of potassium rich food (if the digestive system is correct) will
    give the client more performance power which leads to the client not having
    to rely so much on Nervous Energy= Will Power.

    Thank you. I am treating her with the recommended remedies and did
    recommend the foods as you stated here.  (learned that in class!) 

    As far as the statement of it being tricky to treat blood clots, any
    further recommendations? Any remedy that would dissolve them faster?

    Thanks again, as always, very helpful.

    The main remedy I would use for blood clots in the beginning is Arnica and
    people need to increase their intake of water. And you need to treat the
    Gallbladder, it is responsible for the Bone Marrow.

    I am still working with this client. I have to say she is the most
    challenging of all. 

    I have been using Barijodeel on all hand treatments. The last two
    treatments the points that drop were much fewer.

    Measurement:
    Circulation, Small intestine, Nervous system, Pancreas, Lung (one point)

    Matches:
    Barijodeel, Pertussis, Chronic Appendicitis, Tuberculinum, Salmonella
    Paratyphi, Salmonella Typhi

    Supports used on hands and footplates:
    Hammamelis, Arnica, Mellilotus, NeuralgoRheum, Discus, Osteoheel, Apis, 
    Nervoheel, Aesculus, Szyzigium

    Symptoms:
    Calluses (cause pain while walking) => not decreased. 
    Pain on balls of feet => began after first treatment
    Described pain sounds like nerve pain = shooting through feet causing
    difficulty walking
    One leg shorter than the other => treated successfully
    Stomach issues (vomiting almost every meal) => settled after first
    treatment
    More Energy
    Stress Level => has not decreased

    Questions:
    She feels much better after every treatment and is able to walk with no
    pain, but she is not able to maintain that feeling of wellness. 
    1. Is the stress taking up the energy that she needs to continue healing? 
   
    2. What can be causing the pain on her feet that she claims is due to the
    treatment?  
   
    3. Do you have any suggestions for further treatment?

    1. It is likey that her Adrenals are still lacking.

    2. The pain on the ball of her foot is likely Kidney Insufficiency, in any
    case a Kidney problem. It is very possible that the Treatments are the
    cause since they bring about a bigger load on the Kidneys.
   
    3. I suggest Adrenal and Kidney support. She must also increase her Water
    Intake

    The vomiting with each meal could also have been caused by the Adrenals
    (insufficient energy to digest).

    Karolina - 

    Thank you for your help the other day. It was effective. I focused on the
    Gallbladder and Adrenals and her sugar level went back to normal. However,
    the next day she came it had spiked again after another stressful day in
    her home. 

    Johan -

    I added every Kidney and Adrenal support I found and at the end of the
    treatment she actually chased Star around my office feeling good. I will be
    seeing her again next Tuesday and will see if the treatment holds.  The
    client said that she has been drinking 2 liters of water per day. I believe
    her urine is dark though.

    Without resolving the Cause/Source of her Stress, her body doesn't get the
    opportunity to truly heal.

I was wondering how as biontologists, do you market your biophoton therapy
services?  I guess this should concern many as biontology is still "new" in the
world and a lot of skepticism still abound.

I would appreciate all responses for this.  A productive week to all!

    Hello Boonlow
    I have been marketing my service via the web .. via social media accounts
    and connecting with centers like "alternative to meds" .. so many people
    addicted to medications and the relief they get with sessions with the
    Chiren is simply amazing.
    My first year,  I treated people for free, then asking for donations and
    then at the end of about 12 months I began to charge a set fee. Word of
    mouth was the best. 

    I have presented many articles online which I refer people to that help to
    educate them about the science of biophoton light therapy.. 

    Let me know what you are doing.. I am curious.. I know that this is a late
    response to your original message.. but nevertheless I am interested. Only
    just read your message..

    Hello Sandra,
    Thanks very much for sharing your experiences. 

    I market via website and social media too and although there has been
    responses, it's still rather slow and requires much effort.  I've also done
    free workshops to introduce biophoton therapy as well as market through
    local online marketing solutions companies.

    Thus, I'm just wondering if I may have missed something.

    Regards,

    Hello Boon,

    I think your biggest problem is that Singapore is a completely new market
    for biophoton therapy, and as far as I know, not many of the people who are
    trained there are very active (but I might be wrong…). 

    So I can see why it is more difficult to get a response to online marketing
    than in the United States. You only have your own results that can lead to
    "word of mouth"-spreading. Usually people who look for "Biontology" or
    "biophoton therapy" on the internet have heard about it from someone else.
    So even social media will not have the same effects as when you would use
    them in the United States, were there are over a 100 Chirens being used by
    practitioners.

    Since "word of mouth" is what usually works best, treating people for free
    when you just start somewhere is a great investment. Treating children for
    free is also a great way to introduce Biontology. When parents see the fast
    and often dramatic improvements in their children's health, often the rest
    of the family follows… then friends etc.

    I also remember someone who published the article from Ode "Standing in the
    light" in a national magazine to introduce Biontology in Denmark, maybe
    this is something that can work in Singapore too. We are happy to provide
    you with the article.

    Maybe others have even better ideas… I hope some more input will come.

    Thanks for your feedback!

    Perhaps you have a point about Singapore being a new market.  Perhaps it's
    still the mindset of people here.  They have no problem going to a doctor
    or a specialist at the first instance while it does take a while for them
    to try alternative means. 

    What prompted me to ask about marketing is that as a hypnotherapist and
    working with energy healing and mind development, I do get rather good
    responses via online marketing hence, I'm puzzled to say the least about
    the lack of responses on biophoton therapy.  This is on the fact of both
    Nancy Ho (my colleague) and myself have been quite active for the last 2
    years promoting biontology.

    Thanks again and I appreciate any input that is forthcoming.

    The Article "Standing in the light" was repeated in the same magazine "Nyt
    Aspekt" her in Denmark this year and has did a great job for me. 

    I use Facebook and have a small add ind the magasine "Nyt Aspekt" . I also
    think that participating in alternative fairs/summits, where you give for
    instance a Whiplash treatment, and lecture about the possibilities with
    Biontology are good.

    Having a Blog would also do wel.

    I have the same difficulties in Sweden where Biophoton therapy is also
    pretty new.
    Johan: I would also love to have the article by email: info@truehealth.se.
    I will try to get it in a health magazine here.

    Since no one here has heard of Biophoton therapy or Biontology I have
    decided to promote is as 'migraine therapy based on Biophoton therapy'
    since I have seen remarkable and quick results with various people that
    suffer from migraines. Migraine seems to be a big problem here in Sweden.
    People are very open about their migraines and therefore also about the
    results. Most people know someone with migraines and the results are very
    obvious. I just started this approach and it seems to help. No goldrush
    yet, but slowly it is coming here.

    A late reaction but hopefully still useful for people in 'low biophoton
    therapy dense' areas.

June 2015 - Holistic Dental Care

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
June 2015 edited June 2015 in Q&A Flag
Practitioner:
You have advised that when dental problems are at the root of health issues and
Chiren treatment does not give lasting improvement, it may be necessary to seek
holistic dental care first.
I find that the search for proper dental treatment is not an easy process at
all and would appreciate some guidance, since some of the practices involved
differ significantly from the Biontology approach.

The dentist’s assessment is as follows:
All dental roots alive in spite of a lot of past dental work
Some metal-ceramic dental work, mostly ceramic
Bite is totally off and jaw movements highly restricted
Tension in jaw has pushed teeth toward the front therefore losing contact with
the upper canines
Night grinding was indicated in the kinesiology testing

The dentist’s treatment plan is:
Mechanical readjustment of the bite (orthodontics are out of the question)
Rebuilding the entire mouth over time with ceramic
Neural therapy with Procaine injections
Kinesiology testing to monitor condition along with supplement needs

Questions:
A. Should I avoid practices that are conflicting with Biontology?

B. I have been using Kieferostitis, Granuloma Denti, Myristica Sebifera,
Chelidonium, Verartrum, Nux Vomica, Solidago and Berberis every 5 days, in
total 9 times and aim to continue doing this for a period after the dental
procedures have been completed. Do you consider this a good protocol?

C. The dentist wants to prepare the body according to the holistic dental
approach, which entails making several X-rays, Neural Therapy injections with
Procaine, muscle testing in person at first and long distance later, taking
supplements, homeopathic remedies and probiotics.
Following this protocol is required to be accepted as a client and for the
process to move onward. What are your thoughts about this?

D. The effect of the Procaine injection seemed to clear with Whiplash
treatment, and I added Causticum when I was treated with X-rays. Does this make
sense to you?

E. Is there a way to support the body better with the Chiren sessions so this
will reflect positively in the kinesiology testing and the treatment plan can
be moved forward?

F. Can Chiren treatments lessen the not-so favorable impact of prescribed
supplements?

G. I have a myriad of symptoms and the Hormone System and many other systems
have been dropping from the first time I measured and treated myself. The
symptom that is bothering me the most is discomfort in the chest/heart area
that makes it difficult to breath in. I also experience Adrenal weakness. What
can I do about this?

H. The holistic dental and jaw rehabilitation will involve artificial
constructs. Do you have any advise on what are the best choices as far as
future disturbance goes?

I. In light of this time and resource-consuming road ahead, I discussed the
option of removing all teeth with the dentist. It was advised against, as
apparently the body would be significantly worse off compared to current
status. How do you feel about this possibility?


Answers:
A. Yes, if it is possible at all, you should avoid procedures that are in
conflict with Biontology. Only when there are abscesses that need to be
surgically opened up by a dentist, or when there is metal in the mouth that has
shown to be clearly disturbing, I would recommend drastic dental care. Your
dentist’s assessment does not show any of this, but the problem is that
dentist's X-rays often do not show the abscesses when they are there. I have
experienced a number of times that they only discover them a lot later, when
they are too big to be missed.

B. If you continue to find drops on the jaw points and after 9 treatments it is
still the same, this protocol is obviously not right. Perhaps it might be a
better idea to check for bacteria on the same points. Try the Strep and Staph
bacteria as well as the Food Poisoning bacteria.

C. I do not see any use in any of this. The use of supplements is definitely
detrimental and the use of probiotics is useless if your Intestines are not
100%. Further I find muscle testing unreliable. The use of Procaine might also
be detrimental.

D. Causticum is indeed a good remedy to use if you have had X rays. 
I do not understand what you have done with the Whiplash treatment. What was
the effect of the Procaine injection, and what cleared with the Whiplash
program? Did you run the Whiplash program locally?

E. As I explained, I do not find Kinesiology a reliable method at all. With
Kinesiology there is always a lot of projection involved. The outcome often
tells you more about the practitioner than about the client.

F. The effects can be lessened by supporting the Stomach and Small Intestine
systems. Supplements often cause Ulcers.

G. Adrenal weakness can be the cause of problems in the Lung/Heart area. One
way of balancing the Adrenals is to treat with Selenium and Berberis, and
sometimes there might be a need for physical potassium too. But one should also
keep an eye on the Lung and Circulation meridians. In addition there might be
arteriosclerosis. 
But the symptom might also be caused by the Stomach meridian which runs right
over the area. Jaw and teeth in this way may indeed be involved.

H. If the bite is off and there is so much tension in the Jaw. It seems that
you better first get rid of this tension. If there is a difference in tension
between the muscles on either side, one gets a pull to one side. Tension in all
muscles of the body is caused by the Gallbladder system. If tension on one side
of the Jaw is different than the other side, your bite goes off.
This Gallbladder system might be the cause of the disturbances in the Stomach
meridian. The Jaw also belongs to this system. So, perhaps you should check the
Gallbladder points, but I know too little about the rest of your measurements
to tell you anything.
Teeth grinding, however, is also tension in the muscles of the Jaw.
I think it is most important to get rid of the stress in your muscles or at
least make sure the tension is the same on either side. You can try the same
technique as for different length in legs. The procedure is described in the
manual. Another way to relax the muscles locally is to run a Whiplash program
over the Jaw area on the side that is tense. This must be done before you
decide to partake in a reconstruction plan.

I. If there is no other choice, I would opt for a total removal of all teeth. I
do not think much of the reconstruction that the dentist is proposing.

Liver Cirrhosis

Satya OrionSatya Orion
June 2015 edited June 2015 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
I have been treating myself for 6 months

Current Measurements:
Large Intestine (L) => had a very difficult time balancing the Large Intestine,
it alternates between Food Poisoning and asking for Intestinal Flora.
Lymphatic (L) 
Liver (L) => Just recently begun to show all points dropping.

Today's Session

Measurements:
Lymphatic System (L) - 3 distal points => Pfeiffer
Large Intestine (L) - all points => Salmonella Paratyphi,  Polypus Larynges
Liver (L)  -  Zirhose Hepatis, Hepatitis B w/EB virus, Carcinoma Hepatis (no
match on the Organ Degeneration meridian)

I have read in the forum that the Liver should not be treated until all the
Yang Organs are cleared.  But I feel confused in this situation.   
I have previously treated the Gallbladder with Hepatitis B w/EB virus and
Zirhose Hepatitis.  The Gallbladder is now clear and these remedies are showing
up on the Liver.  

Questions:

1.  Should I treat only the Large Intestine and Lymphatic System at this time?
 
2.  Polyps have just shown up on the Large Intestine.  Could this be the cause
of the difficulty in balancing?
3.  Would it be best to wait to treat the Liver directly until the Large
Intestine is completely balanced (even though I have already used these
remedies in the past to treat the Gallbladder) ?
4.  Can I treat with Liver supports now anyway?

    If the Large Intestine continues to show drops in that amount I would then
    think of re-infection.  I would investigate the possibility of hygiene,
    cooking habits and eating habits.  I know that eating out is becoming a
    lesser event in my life due to food contamination.

    Satya OrionSatya Orion
    June 2015 edited June 2015 Flag
    Yes, I'm feeling it is re-infection as well, and that there is something
    that keeps disrupting the terrain. Food poisoning happens rarely now.
    Mostly the Large Intestine just keeps asking for the Flora every time. So I
    know something is still not right. I have also treated with Heavy Metals,
    and practically every other remedy in the Chiren. So it's still a mystery.

    I've become very careful about hygiene, and cooking, even cleaning the
    fridge with Hydrogen Peroxide weekly. I don't eat at restaurants anymore. I
    even treat a lot of my food with the Chikey before cooking.

    Yes, and if there are conveyer belts at checkout where you purchase food,
    they may also be a source of contamination. While shopping, I noticed once
    the blood from a raw chicken I bought leak onto the belt and I had to tell
    the cashier to wipe it clean.

    Thanks for this reminder. In my most recent measurements the Salmonella is
    now gone and the Large Intestine is once again asking for the Intestinal
    Flora, and Carcinoma Coli.
    So we'll see what happens.

    Lymphatics are also clear now. So I will begin focused Liver treatment.
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    June 2015 edited June 2015 Flag
    The fact that all points on the Large Intestine points are dropping on the
    left side, indicates a serious infection of the mucous membranes there. The
    fact that the Lymphatic points also drop confirms this.

    In a case like that you should try to find out if there is a bacteria that
    balances all these points, and then focus on supporting the body to restore
    from this infection. Focused support is important.
    Polyps could be another cause in the imbalances in the Large Intestine and
    the Lymphatic System meridians. But polyps are caused by the Thyroid.
    Thus you should look into this further. Polyps will not disappear by just
    treating with Polypus Larynges.

    If certain remedies matched on the Gallbladder and cleared the Gallbladder
    drops, these remedies should have finished their job and the same remedies
    should not match on the Liver anymore. 
   
    Having used all remedies in the Chiren does not tell you anything, they may
    still match again. Only the information of things like Polio that you will
    not come across very often in your life, most likely will be needed only
    once.

    I never actually treated with Polyps.  This was the one and only time it
    had appeared in measurement after months of treatment, and I suspect this
    might have been a measurement error.  

    Three days later when I retested, the Salmonella was gone, and the Large
    Intestine was asking for Intestinal Flora and Carcinoma Coli.   I treated
    with these remedies.

    It has been 5 days now, and the Large Intestine and Lymphatics are clear.
     Only the Liver (L) all points are still dropping.

    Remedies that match on the Liver are Zirhose Hepatitis,  Carc. Hapatis,
     Cadmium,  Chlorum,  Phosphorus.  

    Question

    1)  I was treating the Gallbladder with Hepatitis B w/EB for some time.
    Right after the Gallbladder was clear, the Liver began to show drops.   Are
    you saying that the Hepatitis B treatment for the Gallbladder should have
    also cleared the Liver?

    2)  What are your recommendations now for treating the Liver in this case?
     I have been very careful with my measurements and feel sure they are
    accurate.

    When you describe "asking for the Intestinal Flora";
    As a sidenote to remember that when a drop gets corrected with a certain
    Bacteria remedy, it could mean there is an infection/overgrowth with that
    certain bacteria, so then that bacteria is not just functioning for
    building up flora, but to correct this bacterial overgrowth.
    These 4 Bacteria Remedies work both ways:
    Bact Proteus
    Bact Coli
    Bact Lactis
    Bact Pyo

    Yes, I have seen this in my treatments as well.  In the past, the 4 Flora
    have cleared up many infections present on other meridians, while the Large
    Intestine was still healing. Finally the Large Intestine terrain is healthy
    again and could be treated with the Intestinal Flora, which matched.

    Answers:
    1. Yes. Even if Hepatitis B with EB was measured only on the Gallbladder at
    first, and not on the Liver, it was still the Hepatitis B in the Liver that
    was causing the Gallbladder problem. Only the Liver was suppressed... When
    then the remedy is not measured on the Gallbladder anymore, it should also
    not be measured on the Liver anymore.

    2. As far as further treatment of the Liver is concerned, you just need to
    measure and see what you find on these points. Often Hepatitis A is
    measured after you have found Hepatitis B. Other nosodes you can try are
    Pfeiffer, Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Fel Tauri, Febris Wolhynica etc.
    If everything else fails, you can try the detox remedies like Galium. There
    are too many possible toxins to treat them all individually, and this is
    usually not necessary. A broad spectrum detox remedy is recommended.

    1. So now I'm a bit confused, as the Gallbladder is no longer showing
    drops, but Hepatitis A is still measuring on the Liver. What could be
    causing this? The Gallbladder has stayed clear for 3 sessions, as I have
    continued to work through the stages of Hepatitis on the Liver (Zirhose, B
    and now A)

    2. Thank you. I will follow this advice.

    Hepatitis A is a different remedy than Hepatitis B... You did not use it
    before, so why is it confusing that it matches the Liver?

    Yes, that is a bit strange then, is what Johan is saying. Normally you
    would see, that if something is affecting the Liver and Gallbladder at the
    same time and then you treat wit that nosode, that it also corrects both of
    these organs.

    Adenomyose Gallenblase is a remedy that is not that commonly measured, and
    also not that dramatic as far as results go. Inflammation and Cirrhosis
    nosodes are more likely to correct the Gallbladder System. So I still would
    think the remedies you measured (Hepatitis B and Zirrhose Hepatis) worked
    on the Gallbladder.

    I looked back in my notes and saw also that I had recently treated the
    Gallbladder with Febris Wohynica, which I know is also a Liver remedy.
    Earlier treatments were with Biliary Cirrhosis, and Cholycystitis.

    So if I understand correctly, the Liver remedies that I used to treat the
    Gallbladder were also working on the Liver (even though it was showing no
    drops at the time due to endorphins). Perhaps the Liver was in much worse
    shape than the Gallbladder (as it was showing Carcinoma Hepatis for 2
    sessions).

    Thank you for helping me to understand this relationship between the Liver
    and the Gallbladder. It's an area I have little experience with.

    Any remedy will work in the body wherever there is resonance. It does not
    matter where you measure it, it will work on any affected area in the body.
    So if a Liver nosode matches the Gallbladder and you treat with it, it will
    also act on the Liver. 
    But the reason that the Liver doesn't show up in measurement yet is
    suppression, and as long as the Liver is suppressing you know it is under
    heavy stress. Adding to this stress by using Liver nosodes is not a good
    idea, and can even be dangerous. This is why you should never treat with
    Liver nosodes before the Yang organs are relatively healthy. Every aspect
    of the protocol has a reason to it.

    In many cases, when you treat with a remedy, it acts on more systems than
    you are aware of through your measurement. If in some organ the "disease"
    is somewhere on a deeper layer you cannot measure it. If at an other organ
    it is at the surface layer, you will match it on that organ. If you treat
    with it, the effect will be also on the organ where it is still hidden and
    it might never surface there for you to observe. You then do not know if it
    ever was there or whether it has been solved by the other organ where you
    matched it earlier.

    When the Liver has drops, I first try Zirrhose Hepatis, then I try
    Hepatitis AnonB, then Hepatitis B, then I try Hepatitis A, then I will look
    for toxins and in the end I will try a general detox remedy like Galium.
    Unless there is an indication for liver cancer, I will try Carcinoma
    Hepatis then first but fortunately this does not occur very often.

    It is rare that you will find a nosode matching multiple times. 
    Only when there is a structural problem like hardening of the Arteries/
    Veins, or Kidney-/Gallstones this is common. But in general most problems
    are functional and not structural, so nosodes should have an immediate
    effect on the systems.
   
    Appendicitis/Tonsillitis nosodes may also show up several times because the
    mucous membranes are continually exposed to new possibilities for
    infection. In this case it is not so much that Appendicitis "continues to
    show up", but that the reinfection aggravates the condition again. In
    between treatment and new infection there is usually an improvement that
    can be measured and experienced.

    Another reason for other nosodes to show up several times is that the
    nosode is not the cause, or that the session was not done according to the
    guidelines of the protocol. 
    What I have seen is that, if practitioners use too many nosodes or
    otherwise overburden the body (e.g. treat Yin organs before Yang organs),
    the body might not be able to work on some nosodes. This even happens with
    Poliomyelitis sometimes. So if you find this regularly, you know that there
    is something in the way you treat that needs to be changed. Overburdening
    the body is not the fast track, it will give less than optimal progress.
   
    What I mean by the nosode showing up again because it is not the cause, I
    can best explain by an example. If, for example, you find Bacterium Proteus
    on the Bladder meridian (which is very common), then as long as the
    Bacterial Flora in the Large Intestines are not restored (underlying cause
    Appendicitis) this may show up every session. In this case it is also not a
    matter of the nosode Bacterium Proteus that does not work, but of a
    reinfection because of the bad intestinal condition.

    Thank you Johan for this extremely helpful explanation!   This clarifies so
    many things for me that I did not previously understand.

    In my recent treatments of the Liver, I have worked through all the stages
    of Hepatitis, but was also measuring for several toxins (which I also
    treated for at the same time).   It seemed that the toxins were the
    underlying cause for the Hepatitis.  

    Currently there are only drops on the Liver (left) and the only nosodes
    matching are Febris Wohynica and Sutoxol.

    Question:
   
    1.  Was this correct to treat for both toxins and Hepatitis at the same
    time?  or was this over-treatment?
    Treatments seemed to be effective, but I did experience a lot of fatigue.
     So treating in this way may have added stress to the Liver.

    2.  In a case where multiple toxins are found, is it best to treat them a
    few at a time?

    Answers:
    1. You always need to treat what you measure. Usually you will only measure
    one or two nosodes that correct all Liver drops.
    Over-treatment is not just a matter of what you use to treat the Liver, it
    also depends on how many other Organ Systems were dropping, whether the
    excretion channels were completely healthy or not etc. So there is no
    answer that can be given here. 

    Did you already treat with Febris Wolhynica and Sutoxol? If they were
    actually causal they should not be found the next treatment anymore, also
    Liver drops should have been solved then...

    2. The remedies you used are not toxins.
    Febris Wolhynica = a parasite
    Sutoxol = a Pyrogenium (nosode from rotten meat) created from pork meat,
    which is used for inflammatory conditions and related waste products of the
    body

    However, when you do find more than one toxin it will not likely be more
    than two or at the most three. When the elimination channels are healthy
    and you use plenty of support this does not pose a problem in treatment. 

    What does create a problem is treating with all kinds of toxins that are
    not measured. In measurement only the most prevalent disturbance -that is
    why it is usually only one toxin/metal- is shown, and this is the
    disturbance that the body needs to address first. But that doesn't mean
    that there is no resonance with other toxins/metals you may put in the
    slots that are not measured... So if you do this, you force the body beyond
    a point that is natural and comfortable, making it do too much at the same
    time.

    Yes, I understand, and Febris Wolhynica and Sutoxol did clear the Liver at
    that point.

    Previously, though, I worked through all the stages of Hepatitis, plus
    measured several other metals/toxins at the same time which I also treated.
    I did use plenty of support remedies. There was initially a lot of fatigue,
    but it did clear within 3 days. So it seems that this was an appropriate
    treatment.

    Yes, I only ever have used the toxins that were measured. In my case there
    seemed to be quite a few.

Treating a 10 month old

sallydyer
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
A Naturopathic Doctor has contacted me to treat her 10 month old baby. She did
not vaccinate her child BUT the mother did get the MMR and the DPT shot  48
hours after the baby was born. The baby would not nurse for 10 hours after the
mother received the shots. The  reason the mother got the shots was because she
had a tighter antibody test done on herself and it revealed that she had no
antibodies in her system from previous shots. She was concerned that her  4
year son who was not vaccinated, could bring something home from pre-school.She
was hoping she was protecting the baby.  Mom was also on Dicloxacillin for
Mastitis when the baby was 5 months old.


Symptoms:

  • Lazy nurser
  • Spitting up quite often
  • Bad baby acne for 3 weeks
  • Cradle cap
  • When she introduced food at 5 months she became colicky and had bad gas.

I did read the earlier forum questions on treating a baby but I still have a
few questions.


I know whiplash is essential but do I run (2) <2 treatments on the baby? I know
to use hand rods only with the baby.


Can I use nosodes as well with a baby? I want to be careful not to over treat a
baby. It is a little intimating to treat someone so young but the mom is very
adamant that this is the missing piece in helping her daughter to heal and she
is very excited about Biophoton Therapy!


Johan also mentioned that measuring is best but if that is not working should I
symptom treat or would it be better to have a picture of the child on the
footplates and plug the footplates into the port and measure the mother?
Because the mother recently has been vaccinated and has been on antibiotics
would measuring her be a problem?

 I think the mothers vaccinations and the antibiotics can be playing a big role
in the babies issues. Is this the best place to start looking? I think running
the good bacterias might be helpful as well. I also read in the manual to look
at the Kidneys and Gallbladder for colic.

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

    -Cradle Cap is always caused by Whiplash. Acne is always caused by Thyroid
    plus possible Tonsillitis.

    - Treatment time I suggest <2, possibly 2-7 

    - Try to Measure

    - One can Treat Babies with Nosodes

    - I suggest you Treat the Baby with All the Nosodes for the Vaccinations
    that the Mother has gotten
     AND Treat the Mother Too.

    - Colics are normal when a Baby Changes Food. They normally go very fast,
    but treat with Gallbladder and Nux Vomica

    - Also look for Food Poisoning

    First Session:
    I was able to measure the baby the first time I saw her and I feel much
    more confident going into the next session. I measured very quickly and
    will definitely be more thorough next time.
   
    Treatment: 
    I ran half the Vaccinations but next Session I will focus on the rest. I
    will look for Food Poisonings as well.  

    Situation after first treatment:
    Baby was more calm, while passing gas but the gas had gotten worse. 
    Eczema is drying out. 
    Continues to be constipated. 

    Questions:
    1. You mentioned I could possibly run a 2 to 7? Does that mean if the baby
    will sit still that long it is ok to run one 2 to 7? 
   
    2. I have not treated the mother yet. She is still nursing so does that
    mean she continues to pass along the remnants of the shots 5 months after
    getting them? 
   
    3. Could the antibiotics the mother was on have caused low gut flora in the
    baby causing her constipation? 

    Next Session with the baby will be tomorrow.

    1. The baby holds the rods in her/his hands. The mother holds her hands
    around the baby's hands. It is only for two minutes

    2 & 3. If the mother is still breastfeeding, the baby will get a lot of
    toxins of the mother. So if the mother is taking Antibiotics, the child
    will get them too, which means that the Intestinal Flora will be absent.
    Treat with the Intestinal Flora.
    Other toxins too that the mother has can be spread to the child.

    The baby is starting to sleep through the night and her eczema is getting
    better. Her colic was always in the middle of the night when her mother
    nursed her so that is going away as well.


    I noticed the baby has a cyst on her upper lip. Her mother said it was a
    Mucous Cyst that has been growing over the last couple of months and that
    if it continues to grow, it will need to be surgically removed.

    Can the Chiren shrink a lip cyst and where should I focus? I was thinking I
    should measure for Apis on her circulation?

    One of the possible causes of this type of cyst could be a ruptured
    salivary gland due to a trauma or could it be the babies toxic load from
    the shots her mother received?

    Due to similarity you can always use Ovarial Cyst for any Cyst in the body.
    Mercuriusheel is also good for mucosal affections in the mouth...

    And then in general with Cysts you'll have to focus on the Circulation.
    Measure what is needed there... Apis might be an option...
    Toxins are always a problem, but in this case it is not only toxins but
    also the Infections itself... 

    What have you measured on her?
    Have you treated the baby already for all the Vaccinations the mother got? 
    And then the Antibiotics ruined the mucosal flora... did you treat with
    Flora Bacteria already? 
    Did Appendicitis / Tonsillitis show up (Infections happen often after
    "Immunisations", and also after Antibiotics)

Cannabidiol (CBD)

Renate
June 2014 edited June 2014 in Other Therapies & Instruments Flag
There seems to be a movement towards juicing raw cannabis, often as an
alternative cancer treatment.

I’m told that cannabidiol (CBD) obtained by juicing does not create the usual
hallucinogenic effects of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with is obtained by
heating the plant.

If CBD's don't create a hallucinogenic effect, I'm curious they have the same
endorphin effect on the pituitary?  I've not yet had an opportunity to measure
someone who is on CBD's and am curious about it's effects on the body.

    I think measuring will be the only way to know. 
    But as long as it still has pain reducing properties (suppression) it is
    likely there will still be endorphins...

    I am juicing CBD leaves, (legally) and initially in treating my illness
    along with the chiren was taking a CBD tincture. There is not a
    hallucinogenic response from the body. It is not for pain, THC is.  Its
    quite complex, and much different chemically and biologically than the way
    THC works. I'll send you some things. It is quite a breakthrough.
      
    It has not affected my pituitary, nor have I been on an endorphin "high" or
    mask when measuring. Many of my clients are taking CBD for cancer -  there
    is much out there about the positive effects. They call it now the most
    valuable vegetable on earth.  A good introdocumentary is weed 1, if you
    like that watch weed 2 by Sanjay Gupta. The antiseizure capabilities are
    remarkable. As is the documented research, mostly from europe and Israel
    about its healing capabilities.

    Hi Jan,

    I'm also curious about the difference between juicing verses the oils/
    tinctures. 

    I've heard that cold processing via juicing or creating an oil does not
    extract the THC but heating does.  Then I heard that CBD's are a completely
    different variety of plant.  I'm sure there is a lot of misinformation out
    there.

    I am not an expert, I only know what I have learned the past year, but I
    have learned it from many people. Growers, physicians,  nutritionists, and
    alternative medicine clinics.  

    Rick simpson originally developed the phoenix tears high THC oil, one was
    told to acclimate to up to 1 gram a day. The THC was very difficult for
    many due to the psychoactive properties.  

    For a long time now other countries and under the radar people here have
    been experimenting medically with non psychoactive properties of marijuana.
     Plants can be bred for high THC like the old maui wowie, or HIgh CBD -
    such a ACDC.  

    A good way to understand it is to watch weed 1 and weed 2 by Sanjay gupta
    on you tube.. You will understand more. I do not promote it, but I explain
    what I know, when asked, I explain my experience and tell them where they
    can learn more.  

    Creating juice and tinctures from a high cbd plant does not produce any
    pyscotropic high. It has a specific action in the brain but no noticible
    effecton the body. Yet, a lot is going on. Yes, heating activates the THC,
    and the reason phoenix tears is so psychoactive is that is has been heated
    to make it. No Plant is 100 percent CBD or non psychoactive but the ratio
    desired is about 22 0r 21 or 20 to 1, CBD to THC for the benefits of non
    psychoactive medicinal herb.  

    There is a lot on the internet about the health benefits of CBD and cancer,
     some on CBD and Lyme,  and much on CBD and seizures.

    Something that reliefs symptoms right away, and needs to be used on an
    ongoing basis to be effective is always a suppressant. This kind of
    "treatment" is only an alternative if you have decided to give up finding
    and removing the Cause, because it will always interfere with
    self-regulation.

    Suppression is never part of Biontology.

    The only thing that seems to benefit biophoton treatment is removing excess
    instead of adding things.

    For example:
    Less toxins/drugs/supplements
    Less food 
    Less exercise (unless someone doesn't move at all and then someone should
    be encouraged to walk a little)
    Less stress
    Less radiation
    Less thinking/worrying
    Less excitement
    Etc.

    We really live in a time of excess, and that is causing real problems to
    our body and mind.

    Most mercury in our bodies is actually coming from the teeth fillings.. and
    the combination with the other metals with the bridges/crowns int he body
    affect the meridians of the body, it is wise to always take this in

Down Syndrome

Irina
October 2015 edited October 2015 in Interesting Cases Flag
Client:
Woman, 57 years old. I have done one treatment for this lady. Client was
brought in by her sister. Results were positive and she would like to schedule
another session.

Medical diagnosis:
Down Syndrome

History:
COPD => not any more
Accident (2015) => fell down => fractured pelvis, sacrum and head of femur =>
she stopped walking after this and now sits in a wheelchair 
Had several host families => happy with the current one 
Attends sheltered workshops => different activities

Medical Interventions:
Heart surgery (1988) => VSD repair

Medication:
Thyroid medication => for hypothyroidism
Anti-anxiety medication
Anti-seizure medication
Laxatives
Few supplements

Other therapies:
Physical and occupational therapy

Symptoms: 
General distress
Declining cognitive ability
Lack of initiative
Confusion
Lethargy
Anxiety
Low energy
Weight loss,
Swelling => left knee
Incontinence => over 10 years
Muscle and bone weakness.
Recently “discovered” her voice => voices disagreement with loud noises, thus
disturbing other workshop participants  
Very cold feet => bluish in color

Session 1

Preparation:
We transferred her from her wheelchair to the armchair.
Client was uncooperative => groaned loudly non-stop => attempted to stop any
invasion to her space.

2-7 program:
Atropinum and Rescue Remedy => attempt to calm her down, but it failed

Scar Treatment:
Long vertical scar => from solar plexus to collar bone

Whiplash Treatment:
Neck and Tailbone 

Measurement:
Impossible.... I tried to measure few fingers, but didn’t hear any sound.

>12 yrs Program (We had to hold the rods in her hands. She was protesting):
Poliomyelitis, Anti-Tetanus, Selenium, Berberis, Viscum, Cerebrum, Nervoheel, Placenta

Footplate Treatment:
Solidago, Circulo, Neuralgo-Rheum, Plantago

Immediate effect:
She was sitting, looking around, became quiet.

Comment:
Her sister told me that she doesn’t like to drink water. So I was very cautious
to put any more nosodes.

I didn’t even know what can we expect in this case. Perhaps I expected her to
be calmer.
Two days later her sister called me with the good news!

Treatment Results:
Positive changes in behavior => everybody noticed, although no one knew she had
a biophoton session
Eats better
Sleeps well
Calm for the majority of the time
Groaning => stopped
IF complaining => calms down quickly
Shows more interest in surrounding  
More alert and brighter => noticed at the workshop
Wants to be engaged in conversation
Easy transition => host family moved a few days ago


I would like some additional guidance for the follow up appointment. Her sister
wants her to start walking again...

Questions
1. How can I help this client best? 
2. What would you advice for me to do in case I won’t be able to measure her
again? 
3. I feel that her Circulation and Kidney/Bladder system need to be addressed,
do you agree?

Maybe, because she calmed down so much, she will allow me to touch her hands
next time...
I greatly appreciate your advice and input in this case.
Thank you very much!

    2. The only thing you can do when you cannot measure is treat by symptom. 
   
    1. & 3. Lethargy, low energy, lack of initiative are all indicative of
    exhausted Adrenals. The general distress could be a result of this too.
   
    The incontinence, the confusion and the declining cognitive ability could
    be caused by Intestinal Flora being everywhere but in the Intestines. How
    are her stools?

    So I would, in the first place, treat with the 4 Intestinal Flora Bacteria,
    as well as Support remedies for Kidneys and Bladder.

    Since her fall was so bad and led to many fractures and the inability to
    walk, I would also do "Whiplash" treatments over the total body, not just
    over neck and tailbone. At least the areas of the fractures should be
    treated locally, and her whole spine. Please also check if the legs are the
    same length.

    Then I would treat it as if there was Appendicitis Necroticans or at least
    Chronic Appendicitis, as long as you cannot measure.

    treatment from neck to tailbone, so no sequences), then another one over
    the hips, another one over the upper leg, then one over the lower leg, then
    one over the ankles. You need to do that on either side of the body.
   
    You can also choose to give an extra Whiplash treatment over the shoulder
    and arm.

Radiation and other Influences in Spain

CecilieCecilie
May 2013 edited January 2014 in General Questions Flag
I live with my family, 6 members, in Spain. We experience a lot of problems
with Radiation. 

Symptoms:
We were almost without drops when we arrived in August, but the Radiation
causes drops on Appendix point and Feet.
My daughter of 8 has started to pee in bed and thinks it is sad. Appendix,
Stomach, Kidney and Bladder treatment helps, but never for long.
The strange thing is that the baby of 10 months has less drops (only nail point
Large Intestines, Small Intestines and Bladder/Kidneys).

After treatment I feel the difference, more energy and more relaxed.
Removing all metal and spirals from the bed helped, but not enough.

Question:
Do you have any advice?

    How do you know Radiation is the problem?

    There are High Voltage Cables over the house we moved in. And then we were
    in Spin Inversion all the time.
    Johan told me to get rid of the Spirals in the bed and this has helped a
    lot!
   
    We don't have Spin Inversion any more and are not so tired. 
    The Appendix Nosodes seem to help too.
    My 3 year old had Stomach problems (Constipation) the beginning of the
    year. Right now it is Ok.
    The baby never slept in a Spiral Bed

    Appendicitis for Radiation Problems is something that hasn't been found to
    be a correlation... 

    At the same time that your exposure to Radiation increased by the move,
    there was most likely also a change in diet. Spain has a completely
    different lifestyle and diet than the one that is known in Norway... Maybe
    this caused a change in your gut that caused Appendicitis....( just
    guessing...)

    How does your daughter feel about the move to Spain? Does she adapt and
    have friends over there? Is she afraid of something?

    This is a very good question. It might also be Grief that caused the
    Appendicitis, since the Large Intestines pertain to the Metal Element in
    Chines Medicine. 

    But more likely it is some kind of bacteria that caused it... since your
    whole family all of a sudden needs the Appendicitis Remedies.

    At first I thought Bacteria might be the problem too. We tried to measure
    for Bacteria and were careful with selecting our food.
    The baby mosty eats fruit and vegetables and corns (home made, not home
    grown).
    We all have been sleeping in beds with spirals for 3 months (except for the
    baby), but we've changed to beds without them since October/November. 

    Measurement is the same for all of us except the baby:
    Large Intestines (L+R) - all drops 
    Small Intestines (L+R) - nail point  
    Lympatic System (L+R) - all drops 
    Veins (L+R) - all drops
    Cirulation (L+R) - all drops

    Feet - all points drop!!! 

    Measurement of the baby:
    Large Intestines - nail point 
    Lympatic System - nail point

    My daughter had problems with Bedwetting earlier. I tried all usual
    suspects. A fire in a house nearby had scared her. We addressed that and
    also treated her with Luesinum and Medorrhinum. 
    She was fine for some time, but after moving to Spain she again started to
    pee in bed. She is of course missing her friends, but loves it here.
    My husband, 3 year old and I, all have  Luesinum ad Medorrhinum showing up
    often. They seemed to be gone back home, but after moving here showed up
    again. The baby measured for it too when born, but didn't get it back after
    treatment. The oldest never measured for it (only one).
    My husband got an explosion of Sebboretic Dermatitis on Face and Scalp
    after flying. Luesinum and Medorrhinum solved these Symptoms.

    The people who lived in our house before us started getting sick after
    moving here, and they both died of Cancer almost at the same time (don't
    know what kind). They are Swedish, have lived for 10 years in Madrid and
    then 10 years in our current house.

    What is also spooky, is that people don't recover as fast from an infection
    as they do in Norway. Illness keeps lingering in the body and Norwegians
    here notice this.
    When my daughter had a Bacterial Infection she suffered from Diarrhoea and
    Vomiting for 3 to 4 days. I measured and treated both Spin Inversion and
    Bacteria, but after 2 hours it started all over again. This happened twice
    (another Practitioner also measured and try to help, but found the same
    issues)

    Question:
    Could the Water or the Radiation be the Cause?

    I have noticed Chlorinated water in Costa del Sol in Spain. I wonder what
    other things they add, without telling. 

    I am a lot in Spain, and I know how different it is from Norwegian life.
    Most of all I notice a lot of EMF around/in the big Shoppingmalls - which I
    have learned to avoid as much as possible to not get into Spin Inversion. 

    I am om my way to China, where it is easy to get into Spin Inversion in
    Beijing too. I'm very much aware of EMF, which makes it easier to protect
    myself.

    The Dioxin, Charcoal, or.... in the drinking water seems to be the biggest
    problems.

    The Spin Inversion problem near Shopping Malls is something I've noticed
    too, but taking away the Bed Spirals has made a big difference in our
    sensitivity to it. We only lose some energy now and when Spin Inversion
    does orccur it is not as big.

    I'm still surprised about the difference between Norway and Spain. We
    hardly have any drops before we moved, only some infections (viruses,
    bacteria), but they were corrected easily.
    Urine has changed too, from light, odorless, to yellow and smelly.

    Another reason for the baby to be not affected, might be that he never eats
    fish... 
    The baby only gets small amounts of water, but it is also excreted in the
    breast milk
    Dioxin is very hard for the body to detox, because it is stored in body
    fat.

    I think meat would have a bigger amount of Dioxin than water, since the
    body stores it up to 7-10 years? And I eat a lot of bacon. The Spanish diet
    contains a lot of meat...

    I'm thinking now of moving back to Norway. There are also advantages to
    living in Spain: calmer energy, sun, less stress... but we can't have it
    all.

    The Radiation, like you suggested, might be the biggest burden on your
    families Systems and although Dioxin is definitely bad, it is probably not
    the Cause of your Symptoms. The effect of Dioxin exposure usually appear
    slowly, because levels in food are usually monitored and when ingested in
    small amounts it slowly builds up in your body. One of the major and first
    symptoms of excessive Dioxin build-up is a certain type of Acne... 

    Because your Urine is so much more concentrated now, I'm also wondering if
    you've adapted your water intake enough to the warmer Climate?

    Do you also have filters on the shower? Do you visit swimming pools with
    Chlorine in it?

    I have been treating the family recently with:
    Dioxin, Aluminium, Calcoheel, Chlorine, Solidago, Plantago, Selenium 
   
    Results:
    Right after treatment the whole family is suddenly Tired and Grumpy, so it
    is a big part of the problem. Headaches (Bladder/Gallbladder), Sweating a
    lot even though it is not warm (even the baby)
   
    Now I'm not tired anymore between 10pm and 12pm (for the first time), which
    is the time of the Hormonal System. Urine less yellow.
   
    Measurement:
    All Stomach Problems, Appendicitis, Pancreas
    No drops after this treatment. 
    Today is 72 hours after the last treatment and I will measure again.
   
    Other Symptoms: 
    Sweating, Dry Skin, Eczema, Stomach Pain, Constipation
    Seborrhea = form of Acne.
    Husband eats and drinks more and suffers more from it, so he consumes more
    Dioxin...

    I don't know if we have a filter on the shower.
    We drink more water than we need, I think. Especially me, and it is sunny
    here, but not hot in winter time.

    We do have a swimming pool, but I do not us it much since it is just
    getting warm.
   
    Many Spanish people are Overweight or suffer from Skin Disease.
   
    On the Internet I've read that Dioxin can cause Intestinal Cancer and Liver
    problems. So measuring the Appendix moving toward Appendicitis Necroticans
    sometimes makes sense to me.
    Sometimes I measure problems on the Triple Warmer, but that's mostly when I
    have been sick (vomiting or diarrhea), and that has been often.
    Schoolchildren here are affected by this too, so maybe they have a problem
    with Dioxin too?

    Seborrhea is Eczema caused by too much Tallow Deposits on one spot in the
    Skin, therefore it only appears on locations of the Skin where there are a
    lot of Tallow producing glands (scalp and around the nose, eyebrow). So it
    seems similar to acne/tallow. 

    I think Dioxin is the right remedy and now we just have to wait and see how
    the treatment is going.
     
    The Vomiting/Diarrhea in the children (not only mine), often comes suddenly
    when they do not look sick. The Vomiting can last for several days (one
    time a day) and then they are "fine" again.

    So with the Acne of your husband, it might make sense.... very interesting!
     

    Although there is a difference between Chloracne (small, pale yellow skin
    lesions that may last from weeks to years):
    Yushchenko (note that the bags under his eyes were there before he was
    poisoned!)
    Chloracne because of herbicides
    And Seborrhea:
    Seborrheic Dermatitis

    And if it is really such a high amount of Dioxin in the Food (only in very
    high amounts it will give the acute symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea),
    this is a reason to be very careful with what you eat there, because even
    when you have the Chiren, everything that you ingest and is a Toxin still
    has to be excreted. This is a burden to you body....

    I'm very curious to read your follow up...

    New obervation!!!! 

    A month ago I have been away for a week and when I returned home, I found
    many of my flowers dead although it had been raining all week. (maybe the
    rain contained Toxins)

    This morning I have treated one, that still showed some sign of life, with
    airborne toxins. I just looked out of the window and saw that it has
    improved for about 30%! For 26 days I had been hoping it would survive, but
    only now I see improvement. Oh my .....!!!! 
   
    Now I have taken all the dead/sick ones in for treatment... also the brown
    ones that I had given up.
    I will take pictures to monitor progress.

Root Canals and Metal in Mouth

YelyenaYelyena
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Dental Problems/Solutions Flag
I would like to know what can be done if client has permanent metal parts in
bridge, crowns.

According to Karolina:
'If metal in the mouth is disturbing, it
is affecting the energetics of the body. So this means that the
energetic remedies won't hold. This is easy to check some time after
treatment. If all drops come back after just a couple of hours you'll
know that something disturbed the energetics of the body again. There is
in a way an "energetic therapy resistance". - In this particular case
the metal brought the client back into spin-inversion all the time. When
there's spin-inversion the healing stops"

What we can suggest out clients to do with that situation? Buy ChiKey to help
with spin-inversion situation?
I have clients who would look at possibilities to have non-metal bridges or
crowns but I do not even know what information they can search for on internet.
Do you have any suggestions or any websites to refer our clients to if they
would like to redo their dental work?
I would really appreciate help on "teeth" matter.  It looks to be extremely
important for our clients to be able to continue recovery.

    This quote needs to be kept in context... Metal in the mouth can also be
    disturbing without causing Spin Inversion, in that case it is the metal
    poisoning and not the EM effect that causes problems.

    In the case where metal implants are disturbing all the time, the therapy
    won't work. So even running the Chikey several times a day for Spin
    Inversion would be useless.... This is why I called it an "energetic
    therapy resistance".

    But not all metal implants have this effect. You can only tell by observing
    it like described above. 

    In the case where the metal is disturbing you have to tell your client that
    you can't help him/her until the metal is removed. 

    Personally I wouldn't know where to refer people to in the United States,
    but I'm sure other practitioners have experience with dental work...

    Teeth whitening is toxic and not good at all! 

    As to crowns and bridges in full porcelain, the glues that is used to hold
    them in may even be more toxic that mercury in fillings. 

    I have many patients with titanium implants that do not have problems.
    Problems can be caused by the different metals that are in your mouth when
    you have more than one crown. 

    Dentures can also be a problem if they are old they become infested with
    bacteria, the acrilic is porous.When they are brand new they are often
    highly toxic.

    There are products available and in use today that are non toxic. We just
    need to demand it from the dentists. There are dentists informed and using
    them as well. 
   
    To read more about what can be used.. you can go to www.dentistryhealth.com
    - Dr. Douglas Cook.
    There is a E-book where all of this information has been published. You can
    order these products through your dentist. What Dr. Cook has been using is
    a product non toxic to all his patients.
   
    The book is called "RESCUED BY MY DENTIST" comes as hard cover or ebook!
    Very informative!
   
    There they are using over 13 different non-toxic products which can be used
    to replacing fillings, crowns etc.. and each can be tested with the patient
    for compatibility before use.
   
    All metals in the mouth are creating a galvanic current. And this will
    always put stress on the body on that particular meridian of that tooth.

    We can treat such patients but they should be made aware that a mouth full
    of implants always causes everlasting disturbances, so does the permanent
    dental bridge. 

    Bone from a donor might be OK to treat.

    Their mouth might look nice but the procedures cause health problems
    forever. People always put the outside before the inside.

    are coming from. He has a few root canals as well. This forum is great. I

    What do I tell to a client who needs to remove root canal tooth and put
    permanent dental bridge? Would it be better if she can find someone who
    will make bridge from non-metal materials? 

    If that is not possible I can only assume that metal foundation at the
    dental bridge can potentially cause disturbances. 

    But that is not the case in all people and we do not really know what
    relationship this metal part (or non-metal) can have with that particular
    body. Is it better just to leave empty space? Not according to any dentist!
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    March 2013 edited March 2013 Flag
    I would recommend a non-metal implant. Apparently they are available.

    Metal bridges can only be detrimental if there are two or more separate
    metal objects on the mouth.
    Because every metal object has its own electrical potential, it can cause
    electrical currents in the mouth.
    It all depends on how big the difference in electrical potential is. 

    On top of that, different metals have a different potential. If you have a
    gold filling and an amalgam filling, that alone is a possible cause for
    problems

    Then it depends on the size of the filling.

    I would also check the tooth maps and see if the affected tooth has any
    relationships to the drops and symptoms.

    Gary your question is very valid. Mostly we need to pick the least toxic

    long. 
    I agree there often are less than ideal scenarios and you just need to pick
    what you think is best for you given your current knowledge base, total
    situation (and pocketbook)... the Melisa Medica Foundation website
    discusses dental metals.

    Zirconium is a transition metal similar to titanium but different,
    according to the Melisa website if a person is metal allergic or metal
    hypersensitive, zirconium or ceramics/ hybrid resin may be OK and if you
    want titanium you could do a blood test first to make sure its OK. 

    Inion Inc. is an interesting website with biodegradable dental materials
    but I haven't heard a dentist comment on their products yet.

    Here is a possible natural option for 'Whitening teeth'.  Some clients have
    found that doing "Oil Pulling" with virgin coconut oil has helped their
    teeth become whiter, they look naturally white not artificial looking
    white. They take a Tablespoon of coconut and 'swish' it in their mouth for
    20 minutes then they spit it out.  Their teeth are getting whiter.

    Implants and bridge carriers are normaly never made out of the heavy metal
    zirconium, what actually is used is zirconiun dioxide known as zirconia, it
    is white and not grey, not a metal at all! Hybrid resin or so called
    composites have some very toxic contents, there are no long range tests on
    the products. Please don't forget that a bit of poison is also good for
    your body, it's always the balance between how much good you do for
    yourself to compensate for the bad things. That goes for all things in
    life, from physical to mental health.

    OIL PULLING was recommended by Dr. Helmuth Keller and Dr. Hans Nieper of

    BUT swish around mouth very gently, spit out after 5 minutes, if there are
    Toxins that can be removed via Oil Pulling, a little Ball will form in the
    mouth, if no Ball forms, both Doctors said "you are clean" this should be
    done daily as Toxins do accumulate in our system.

    they have restaurants accommodating the dental patients etc.. 
   
    They will pick you up at the airport.. 2-3 days stay!! They will test the
    composites compatibility before putting into the patients mouth. They use
    homeopathic remedies.. and from everyone I have seen who returns from
    there.. they have these happy faces.. because they say no pain, and no
    bankrupting their finances. 
    So this is also a solution we can offer our clients!

    I also need an implant where a root canal gone bad came out. A top oral
    surgeon told me that ceramic implants are not approved yet stateside due to
    the lack of testing and reliability. 

     I am willing to try anything other than the bovine-derived bone graft and
    inelegant titanium screw used as standard practice here (the dental waiver
    was enough to scare me out of it) but don't want to create more issues if I
    can't be guaranteed future support for any non-mainstream procedures. 

    Question:
    1. Is the risk in doing nothing just as great? 
    2. Can sinus holes be healed with Biontology?

Q&A - Length of the Sessions

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
May 2015 edited May 2015 in Q&A Flag
It has been brought to my attention that some people seem dissatisfied with the
length of the Q&A sessions, which is kind of odd if you understand the nature
of these sessions. So I think the concept needs some explanation. Maybe this
will help you make these classes more to your satisfaction in the future.

Q&A Sessions:

1. Q&A sessions are given to provide the opportunity to students to get a
direct answer to their presubmitted questions. When there are no questions,
there are no answers to give, and there is no session. Johan has answered all
the questions that were submitted and when there was hardly anything to answer,
I went out of my way to add topics even though this is not my responsibility.

2. Topics that I added still came from input from other sources. I have, for
example, used questions that were raised in the case-studies and common
misunderstandings that Johan observed in them. I have also used the feedback
from clients who came to us after having received damaging treatments from
Chiren practitioners. But this is not an ongoing stream of inspiration and what
it boils down to is this: If we don't know what your questions are we cannot
answer them!

3. Making the Q&A sessions a success, just like making the forum work, is
dependent on your own cooperation. Learning is not a passive state. Formulating
your own questions and digesting and answering those of others is a very
important tool to grow. As Johan has emphasised many times: Biontology is all
about asking the right questions!

4. The forum and Q&A are now dependent on a very small group of enthusiastic
practitioners, who are not afraid to post their questions. By sharing their
insecurities about certain topics they help others who have similar questions
benefit too. This kind of sharing is what is important, because it will lead to
growth not only of yourselves but of others. All knowing comes true experience
and asking questions. If there is no question anymore the learning stops.

5. Both Q&A and forum provide a platform for direct communication between you
and Johan, which is unique and was not available before 2012. But it is your
own responsibility to get the best out of it. It is a shame that so few people
seek to benefit from this opportunity and wait until maybe someone else will
post similar questions to theirs.

I myself am still asking questions to Johan all the time and when there is a
new insight I try to make you all benefit by incorporating this into the Q&As
or forum. On the other hand, it also happens that questions that you ask never
crossed my mind and help me to find new understanding on a certain topic. So I
really want to renew the invitation to participate in and contribute to this
mutual learning experience.

    On two separate occasions I emailed questions for the Q&A sessions and both
    times my questions were not presented. One of those times was when the
    emails went to Diane and the other time was emailed to Robert. Robert did
    get back to me at a later date and said he found my questions the following
    week, so I thought those questions would be presented in the next Q&A but
    they weren't so I have not gone through the trouble of typing up any
    further questions. I am wondering if anyone else has had this problem?

    Thank you Ronda. I am sorry to hear this, Johan and I always answer
    everything that we receive from the office. But, of course, if we don't
    receive a question that is a problem... 

    When people work, mistakes can be made. We are all human, and even though I
    try my best, I myself sometimes miss questions on the forum too (they are
    then answered the moment they are brought to my attention).

    As far as I know, questions not being included in the Q&As has happened to
    one person before. We answered those immediately through email when she
    sent us an email making us aware of this, and also changed the procedure of
    collecting questions. First a list was made by employees, now they send me
    the questions the moment they receive them and I add them to a document
    myself. I wonder if your complaint is a recent one...

    Anyway, I don't believe the lack of questions comes from these incidents.
    However, we want to know if there are more people who have submitted
    questions and did not get a response. And especially if that happened
    recently.

    As far as your questions are concerned, can you post them here? 
    There is another option for submitting your questions and that is or under
    the Section Q&A on this forum. I would advise to only if you want to remain
    anonymous, send your questions to the office, and otherwise submit them on
    the forum. 
   
    Thank you for keeping communication open. We can only improve on things if
    we know what goes wrong, so I really appreciate your openness.

Transferring A New Remedy From A Vial To The Chiren

    1) Here is the link with information on how to create new remedy-cards to
    put into the Chiren:

    http://www.biontology.com/vanilla/index.php?p=/discussion/27/
    copying-a-remedy#Item_5

    2) put the vial (with alcohol or salty water to hold the information best)
     on the footplate with blue light, 
    then put the remedy you want to load in one of the slots and run the
    "Remedies" Program

    I was taught to put the remedy in the cup, a new card on the foot plate
    with light, then press remedy if it should be a remedy, if it was to be
    inverted then neutralisation program. 

    Or remedy on foot plate without light (instead of the cup) and new chip
    card on foot plate with light.?

    Please verify.

    March 2013 edited March 2013 Flag
    Yes, this is described step by step in the link I gave you. This answers
    question (1)

    But in your question (2) you asked how to copy a remedy into the vial, not
    into the card.... So in this case the vial should be on the footplate with
    the light, and the remedy you want to use is in the Chiren so no card is
    needed in this case. 
    (and you don't use the Neutralization program in this case since in the
    Chiren all remedies are programmed the way you need to use them, you don't
    want to invert this information (again))

Chikey - Brain Damage

sallydyer
February 2014 edited February 2014 in Chikey Flag
Client: 
54 yr old female 

History: 
Stroke => 6 years ago 
3 Root Canals

Symptoms:
Brain damage => right side 

Treatment:
I have cleared all her points but the Jaw Point.
She owns a Chikey now.

Question: 
1. Would it be helpful to program a chip card with Cerebrum, Thalamus and
Viscum to work on her brain? 
2. Is it possible to repair the damage to her brain?

    Answer:

    1. The remedies you suggest do not address the cause, since a stroke is
    caused by Calcification and Weakness of the Cerebral Arteries. So your card
    should contain Barijodeel and Aurumheel in my opinion.

    2. Only the body can repair itself… The body will do this to the extend
    that it is still possible, but only if the Blood Circulation in the Brain
    is OK.

    Cerebrum does improve the Brains ability to make new connections, so that
    would be a good choice to support with the recovery.

    February 2014 edited February 2014 Flag
    I am sorry, I should have clarified in my post that I have been working on
    the cause. 

    I have run Barijodeel 7 times and Aurumheel 5 times. 

    I did not think the body was still measuring for it anymore but maybe I
    need to check again today in case I was not accurate enough. Looking back
    at my notes, 5 times might not be enough treatments for Aurumheel when
    someone has had a stroke. I will see what she measures for and make the
    Chikey card. 

    Thank you. Sally

    I think she should defintely look at the jaw.

    You can create a Chikey card with Kieferostitis and Granuloma Denti, maybe
    Myrystica Sebifera if you have it in your Chiren.

Measuring, Spin Inversion and Multiple Sclerosis

judyth
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client is 59 year old female. Symptoms began about 20 years ago, approximately
2 years after the birth of daughter. Difficult pregnancy, preeclampsia, bed
rest for several months before premature birth and c-section. Symptoms in legs
started after a severe case of flu. All symptoms continue to increase in
severity, she walks with a cane. She verbalizes a lot of fears and apologizes
constantly for the state of her health.

Symptoms: 
Muscle weakness and numbness, bilateral lower extremities. Both legs partially
numb from the mid calf to the tips of her toes (feels like anesthesia wearing
off). Feet and legs are very sensitive to touch (gets agitated when socks come
off). Very fatigued, sleep interrupted 5-6 times during the night, wakes
feeling she has to urinate, usually there is very little result. Extremely cold
feet. Legs, feet and toes go into spasm when measuring them (looks like CP).
First bladder infection about 3 month ago. Last week her legs gave out, upon
falling twisted her Left ankle and broke her Left fibula.  She is not casted.
Reported a lot of pain, there wasn't a lot of swelling. 

Medical diagnoses and interventions: Initially Multiple Sclerosis, which client
refused to accept. Numerous tests for Lymes were negative, 3 yrs ago tested
positive for Borellia. Took antibiotics for Bladder infection 3 moth ago.

1st measurement:
Heart (left) - 8c, 8d
Veins (left) - 1c
Organ Degeneration (right) - 1b
Feet - no drops, high sounds

Treatment 2-7year program:
 Viscum, Plumbum, Atropinum

Feet no drops, points sound the same

Treatment Spin Inversion:
with blood in cup
feet no drops 
repeat Spin Inversion Program. 
Still no drops in feet

Treatment Whiplash:
no drops in feet

Treatment Scar:
Legs,  horizontal C-section  
Still no drops feet

Treatment 2-7yrs:  
Placenta, Psorium, Schwefheel

2nd measurement:
Triple Warmer (left) - Thymus (Little Flannel Flower), Selenium, 
Triple Warmer (left) - Adrenals (Berberis)
Nervous System (left) - 2 Rubella
Organ Degeneration (right) - 1b Rubella 

Both feet no dropping points, same as above

Treatment >12:
Little Flannel Flower, Selenium, Berberis, Rubella, Cholecystitis (see if I
could force drops on Gallbladder)

3rd measurement:
Triple Warmer (right) - 1a Gallbladder remedies
Tripple warmer (right) 1-1 Poliomyelitis, 

Feet no drops points the same


Treatment footplates: 

Adenoma Gallenblase, Calculi Billiaris, Billiary Cirrohsis, Poliomyelitis,
Circulo, Spascupreel, Atropinum
 
4th measurement:
Triple Warmer (right) - 1b Varicellan

Feet no drops sound not so high and loud

Treatment 2-7yrs:  
Varicellan, Herpes Zoster (she recently had a severe case of shingles )
Ozaliet, Fringed Violet

Final measurement: no drops hands or feet

Any thoughts about why I can't read her feet?  Is it possible to have half of
you in spin?  I was a little concerned about giving Nosodes when I couldn't see
what was happening in Bladder and Kidneys.  
Should I keep treating her if I can't get feet to drop?  Also, with drop on
Nervous System that clears with Rubella, might it be MS?  Symptoms are unusual
for Lymes. If yes for Multiple Sclerosis has anyone treated someone with MS,
anything I might look for?  Is there anything that will bring down swelling in
sprain, speed healing in boken bone?  

Thanks  Judyth

    Measurement problems..... not Endorphin Masks

    What I notice is that many students are too much focussed on endorphin
    masks and this causes you to overlook other measurement problems. 
    Problems with your technique like pressing to hard, problems with fluid
    retention, problems with sweaty hands and feet, using to much water on your
    probe.... they all cause high sounds and none or few drops. 
   
    An Endorphin Mask doesn't create high sounds, but normal sounds without any
    drop. True high sounds (that are not due to wrong measurement or water) are
    only found in very rare cases of acute infections, so not in most of our
    clients who have chronic conditions. There is so much suppression nowadays
    that I haven't found a true High measurement in anybody since 1990.

    High readings everywhere is a problem with water/sweat. Too much water on
    your probe, water retention in your client, sweaty hands and feet. This is
    solved by drying the hands and feet with a towel or, in case of water
    retention, improving the circulation. 

    To put the Endorphin Mask (not the high sounds that indicate infection!) in
    perspective, I would say it only happens in 1% of the treatments and it
    doesn't show high readings. The very high measurements, that indicate
    infection, you can keep in the back of your head for those very, very rare
    occasions.

    I also don't understand the choice to treat with Schwefheel and Psorinum,
    which are indicated for Therapy Resistance (inability of the body to react
    on treatment) and not for Measurement Problems

    Comments on your case:

    All symptoms indicate circulation problems, which probably is caused by
    calcification in Arteries and Veins. Another cause might be the
    Gallbladder.

    Because of the symptoms of numbness in her legs and cold feet, I think the
    small capillaries are blocked.

    I'd like to know if your client has fluid retention and if her fingers feel
    puffy, or the opposite and they are very dry.
    If they are dry you can use Atropinum and Placenta. These remedies should
    be used before the measurement and often this will allow you to measure
    then. 
    But if there is calcification this won't work. You can use Barijodeel and
    Aurumheel for this.
    When the fingers are puffy you should work on the speed of her circulation.
    Find what problems there are in both Heart and Adrenals, treat these
    problems and support the organs to strengthen them. Also look at the
    condition of the valves of the Veins, you can strengthen them with
    Hamamelis.

    There's only fluid retention in her left ankle which she recently sprained
    and it was slight.  
    Her right foot-the ankle not sprained- was not dry, puffy or sweaty.
    There was no water on the probe when measuring her feet. 
    Her legs and feet had no visible varicose veins.

    Both feet were  very cool and again when I tried to measure her feet,her
    legs,feet and toes would spasm- several times she kicked me. 

    I had no difficulty measuring her hands which were neither sweaty, puffy or
    dry. The temp in her hands was normal.   

    I didn't think of calcification with no drops on Parathyroid. I will try
    Barijodeel and Aurumheel and see if that helps measurement in feet, pursue
    drops on Heart if they reappear. 
    Her Adrenals cleared with Selenium and Berberis, should I look for
    something else there?  Does the drop on the Nervous System  that cleared
    with Rubella indicate that she may have MS?  Thank you.

    Hi Judyth,

    Regarding the measurement, different skins and different areas need
    different pressure. So if water was not the problem in your experience. A
    "screaming point", like many of you like to call it, means you have to put
    less pressure on the point.

    I suggested Barijodeel and Aurumheel amongst several things that might be
    the problem with her circulation and how you might identify them by e.g.
    dryness/puffiness of the fingers. Since you don't feel that any of these
    problems are there, you have to rely on your measurements. 

    If there's calcification it is from a previous malfunction of the
    Parathyroid. The Parathyroid ALWAYS drops in the first treatment when there
    has been a Tetanus vaccination (this is combined in one shot with Polio,
    which you did measure...). Poliomyelitis is always measured on the
    Pituitary gland (left hand). 
    Is this your first session with her? Calcifications in the Arteries/Veins
    are usually not solved in just one treatment.

    When the Adrenals are exhausted circulation is a problem automatically.
    And another thing with Adrenal fatigue is that the Gallbladder must have
    serious problems! If the next treatment the Adrenals show up again give
    extra energy support along with the remedies you measure to correct the
    point.
   
    Rubella measured on the Nervous System can indicate that your client has
    Multiple Sclerosis, although we can never diagnose that from
    the measurement itself. You can measure Rubella on someones Nervous System
    without him/her having MS symptoms. 
    The illness Multiple Sclerosis is diagnosed by symptoms that are caused by
    the Nervous System or the Liver.
   
    I don't think this woman's symptoms give an indication for MS. So although 
    she has two problems that can cause MS symptoms (she has Rubella on her
    Nervous System and she has a sick Liver), there's no indication for me to
    believe she has Multiple Sclerosis.

    Second session:  
    Adrenals - China and Aesculus
    Triple Warmer, Veins, Nervous System - Anti Tetanus, Barijodeel, Hamamelis 

    Gallbladder remedies on the footplates:  Salmonella Typhi, Salmonella
    Paratyphi, Calculi Billiaris, Calculi Renales, Injeel Chol, Hepar, Adenoma
    Gallenblase, Billiary Cirrhoses, Cholecystis.  

    There were still no drops on her feet  I didn't go into more detail because
    my questions are  about session three.

    Session 3: 
    client was very agitated fearful,talked constantly about one thing than
    another.Her feet are still cold. Had difficulty sitting thru measuring.
    Each time I started to measure she felt she had to use the restroom but
    when she got there, there was nothing. 
    She is still getting up 4-5 times at night with the urge to urinate, which
    leaves her fatigued in the day. She wanted  to stop the session several
    times  so she could eat (she had just eaten before I came). 
    As soon as I'm done measuring she wants to know if now can she read or
    knit. This behavior is similar to previous sessions but very intensified.

    1st measurement:
    Heart (left) - point above the nail
    Nervous System (left) - Ns1c, above the nail point
    Large Intestines (right) Li1b-1
    Nervous System (right) - Ns1c, above the nail point
    Organ degeneration (right) - 1c,1b,1a
                   
    No drops on feet
                                                 
    My first thought was to clear the Intestines.  I started thinking Food
    Poisoning, along with drops on Nervous System and her history that the
    muscle weakness and numbness in legs all started after an extremely bad
    case of the flu.  
    So I put in Botulism and it cleared the Heart, Nervous system, Organ
    Degeneration.
   
    >12 Program:
    Botulism, Atropinum 

    2nd measurement:
    Nervous System (left) - Ns1c, above the nail point
    Lymphatic System (left) - Ly1-1
    Triple warmer - Tw 1-1
    Organ degeneration
    Heart - point above the nail

    Pancreas (right) - Sp1a

    My first thought was to clear the triple warmer. I put in Gallbladder
    remedies and they cleared all points.
   
    Footplate Treatment: 
    Billiary Cirrhosis, Cholecystitis, Adenoma Gallenblase, Chelidonium,
    Calculli Billiaris, Calculi Renales, Cuprum, Berberis.
   
    3rd measurement: no drops.
   
    Questions: 
    The drop on her Pancreas I felt was a good measure and it's the first drop
    on her feet so maybe her Gallbladder is calming down.  
   
    I) Her emotional/energetic/behavioral self is so overwhelming I find it
    difficult to think when I'm with her and by the end of the session I
    wasfeeling very relieved to leave. Is there any preparation. I can do on
    myself before I see her to help with this and then is there a short
    Treatment I can give her before I start to measure so that she concentrate
    better on the session?
   
    2) I'm feeling this behavior might be a symptom, what is your thought on
    that?  Other Food Poisonings, Heavy Metal poisoning?
   
    3) I was suprised when the Gallbladder remedies cleared all the points on
    Nervous System, Heart and lungs, although I think her Gallbladder is a very
    big problem.
   
    4) In my notes I have Salmonella (both) and Cuprum as Gallbladder remedies,
    they are not on the new protocol. Should I exclude them from that list?
   
    5) Would you comment on my choice of Botulism to clear the Large
    Intestines?
   
    6) It concerns me that there are no drops on Kidneys or Bladder, especially
    given the urgency and frequency of her need to urinate with very little
    outcome.  It could definately be a measuring issue,her feet and legs go
    into spasm every time I touch them. Should I be putting in supports for
    Kidney and Bladder?
    She reports good bowel movements so that exhit is clear.

    7) You said initially you think she has a sick Liver.  Should I put in
    supports for that or wait until it shows?
    Thank you for your imput,to date she is my most difficult case/client.

    Session 4 
    Muscle tone in legs and feet more relaxed.  Only woke up twice during the
    night and only up once to urinate. The numbness in her legs and feet remain
    the same (very concerned about that). 

    Her hands are very dry, a short treatment with Atropinum and Placenta made
    measuring easier.

    1st measurement:

    Heart (left) - He 8c

    Circulation (right) - Ci 8e  -  Injeel Chol balanced this and cleared all
    drops on other organs too.
    Organ Degeneration (right)
    Heart (right) - He 9
   
    No drops on feet

    Treatment:  >12 years 
    Injeel Chol, Adenoma Gallenblase, Cheledonium, Billiary Cirrhosis, Calculi
    Bil, Calculi Renales, Cholecystitis, Hepar

    2nd measurement:

    Small Intestines (left) - 1c  - Salmonella Typhi balanced this and all
    other drops
    Organ Degeneration (left)

    Nervous System (right) - NS 1c
    Nervous System (right - NS 1a
    Circulation (right) - Circ 8e 
    Circulation (right) - Circ 8f
    Heart (right) - He 9

    Pancreas (right) 

    Footplate treatment:
    Salmonella Typhi, Circulo, Barijodeel, Nux Vomica, Selenium

    3rd measurement:
    Heart (left) - He 8e
    Veins (left) - Ve1

    Large Intestines (right) - Appendix Point - Chronic Appendicitis,
    Appendicitis balanced this and all other drops 
    Heart (right)

    Gallbladder (left)

    Treatment: 2-7 year 
    Appendicitis, Chronic Appendicitis, Tonsilitis, Anginheel, Mucosa

    4th measurement:
    no drops

    Questions:

    1) Do you have any thoughts on why her legs and feet are numb and how I
    might work on that?  She is very concerned about this.

    2) When she was diagnosed with Lymes she was put on a very high dose of
    antibiotics.  Do I need to neutralize that and if so with what?  She no
    longer has any of those to put in the cup. 

    3) She has a lot of fears, how do I check the health of her Intestinal
    Flora?  She takes a probiotic.  After the Appendix is healed, if I put in
    Intestinal Flora, could I overload her if she continues the probiotic?

    Thank you,

    1+2) I would try Tuberculinum (Bovinum), Luesinum and Medorrhinum for her
    behavioral problems. 
    It looks like she is very nervous but it does not look like a normal
    nervousness. 
    You could strengthen yourself before she comes, if necessary.
   
    4) Salmonella could on occasion be found on the Gallbladder, but is not a
    "Gallbladder remedy". If you have a patient with manic depression, then you
    could find salmonella on the Gallbladder.
    Cuprum is never found on the Gallbladder, but copper could also cause
    spams, just like Gallbladder issues. So you can use this remedy for
    cramping/spasms. 
   
    5) Botulism could be a remedy for the Large Intestines, but only if you
    have found it on the Nervous System as well. 

    7) I would wait for the Liver to show.

    Answers on session 4

    1) The numbness in the legs and feet is caused by bad Circulation. So you
    need to focus your treatment on this, I don't see you do this.

    I notice that every time you measure you get different drops. That is
    curious.

    After the first measurement you measured no drops on the feet, but you have
    chosen all Gallbladder Remedies for the treatment. Why?

    Don't do anymore than two treatments. For adults this is one >12 year
    program and one Footplate Treatment. No additonal 2-7 year program, this is
    only needed in very rare occasions when after the hand and footplates the
    Hormonal System or Kidneys are not balanced.

    Amount of Sessions: 6

    Focus of Treatment:
    Circulation, Gallbladder, Liver. 
    Liver showed and was treated 2 times.  

    Results after 6 Sessions:
    Tuberculinum relieved Anxiety quite a bit (you were right). Anxiety was
    gone after 6th Session.
    Feet Symptoms => Muscle Spasms pretty much gone, Improved Circulation (warm
    and less numb) 
    Fatigue quite decreased, Stronger in Legs, Improved Walking, Improved
    Sleeping (only waking once a night)

    Situation right now....
    Within a week of returning to work (during treatment she was home due to
    broken leg) she experienced Fatigue and Weakness again. After three weeks
    the Numbness, Cold and Spasms in her Feet and Legs were back.
   
    Work Situation:
    Surrounded by Fluorescent Lights, Computers, Phones, Cell Phones. She is a
    Librarian.
   
    2 Sessions after her return to work:
    No response to the Sessions. 
    All progress has stopped and she has regressed to where she was when we
    first started.  
    No other change in life, except returning to work which she seems to
    enjoy. 
    I don't sense she's wanting a reason to quit.
   
    Both Sessions I found Endorphins => all green points and unable to measure
    without Atropinum. I don't measure a Spin Inversion. 

    Question: 
    Is the environment she is working in keeping her from responding to the
    Biophoton Treatment?  I'm thinking it might be. I'm not sure because I
    don't find a Spin Inversion.

    It seems that the Cause is definitely the Work Environment.

    If it is the Fluorescent Lights, you should try Ozaliet, Causticum

    It might also be the Chair on which she sits every day. See if she can get
    a Chair without Metal parts.

    2 Sessions (8th and 9th session) since your recommendations.  
   
    Further information:
    Has been sitting on a plastic chair at work for years.
   
    Treatment:
    Used Ozaliet and Causticum both Sessions. 
   
    Results:
    Minimal improvement. 
    Only waking once during the night (used to be 3-5 times)  
    No change in: Fatigue, Muscle Spasms and Weakness, Numbness in Feet and
    Anxieties. 
   
    I suggested Biontology might not be very effective while she is still in
    the same work environment. She became very upset, anxious and definitely
    wants to continue. Of course she wants to progress as we were when she
    wasn't working. She has started using a product called Earthing sheets.  

    Questions:

    1) Is there benefit to treating her while she continues to work in this
    environment.  
    Is it possible we might make progress - just really slow like her sleep?

    2)  If we continue and don't make much progress is it possible she might
    become resistant to this therapy and if she should leave her work she might
    not get the results we did in the beginning?

    3) Do you have any experience with Earthing Sheets?

    1) The only way is to truly research the Cause in her working environment
    and get rid of it or change it in a way it is bothering her less...
    * use another chair without metal for a while
    * watch lighting and electrical devices around her workplace, try to maybe
    change location of work spot.
    * does she drive to work in a hybrid car?
    * .....

    2) No, there's no danger to become resistant

    3) Earthing Sheets are bad in Johan's experience. Because of the metal they
    function like an antenna and even though it is directed into the ground,
    sitting/lying on this kind of antenna, exposes you to a EM field.

Bipolar and Anxiety

Janet
March 2013 edited February 2014 in Symptoms Flag
I have a client coming in at 1:00 pm on Wednesday March 6th, (that's today) I
just received information on him.

Client: 20 year old man and is Bipolar and suffers from Anxiety. The symptoms
started when he was 14 years old. The symptoms are worse in the evenings around
7:00pm and are least severe during the midday.

Many symptoms: headaches, stomach aches, aching joints, nausea, loss of
appetite, strong fatigue, dizziness, paranoia, depression, anxiety, anger, lack
of coordination, memory loss, inability to think clearly, hopelessness,
suicide, and lack of focus. He worries a lot about being worthless, he suffers
from feelings of guilt he also worries a lot about friends and family. He is
the happiest when he is sleeping and he dreads humiliation.

I am going to need lots of guidance with this client. The only thing I know to
start out with is the standard protocol and go from there. I am open to all
suggestions.

    Janet, Here is how I would approach this patient and why. What is simple
    about Biophoton Therapy is that first we we listen to people tell us their
    story --what they think is going on inside themselves and we listen to them
    telling us what their symptoms are.  Second, we listen to the Chiren as it
    tell us where there is dis-ease in the body through the drops. We observe,
    we listen, and we respond to the drops by finding which remedy/information
    the body recognizes as the balance for what is dropping. Stay open, listen,
    don't prejudge what should be the correct remedy. Let the body tell you
    what they need. We follow the body as the body unfolds where it is stuck
    and what it needs to begin to recover. The body has an innate intelligence.
    It knows what it needs. As we listen the body tells us where it is ill and
    what makes it better. ALL healing takes time. People need to understand
    that too. We need to notice when patients are impatient, restless, wanting
    it right now and how they need to learn that their body didn't breakdown
    overnight-so it isn't going to repair in an instant. I believe all of us
    would like to participate in miracles on a regular basis. My experience of
    20 years is that healing takes time and that patients who give themselves
    time to heal over time get the most out of it. 
    I encourage you to be patient with yourself as you unfold the jigsaw puzzle
    of the dilemmas that are embodied in your clients ill-being. We are dealing
    with basically 11 systems of the body that are designed to work together.
    Alot of things are going on simultaneously in the body. Give yourself some
    time to help this person. The information you need to know to help him
    appears overtime as the body unwinds.

    Hi Janet,

    Standard protocol is what you have to focus on in the first treatment.
    Balancing the hormonal system will take a lot of your space and the Kidneys
    might have issues too. 

    To treat Anxiety and Bipolar syndrome focus on the Gallbladder. You might
    find Salmonella on it. Try to balance the Gallbladder out and support it
    well.

    the Mother informed me that he was having a bad day and a 4 hour trip to my

    said that they would try to make the trip in April.  So until that time I

Cosmetics, Cadmium and Kidneys....

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Toxins Flag
I just read in WDDTY (first US-issue, coming out on the 7th of May, I already
have it) that Cadmium poisoning occurs frequently and is part of all cosmetics.

Cadmium is a Pseudo-Estrogen (Binds to Estrogen Receptor side) which causes
enhanced Estrogenic activity. It also affects the Kidneys and the Blood. 

Like other Heavy Metals, Cadmium seems to inhibit the take out of Acid from the
Blood by the Kidneys. 
Cadmium can really ruin the Kidneys. 
Too much Acid in the Blood, has many serious effects.

I haven't found Cadmium/Strontium very often as a Remedy that was needed in
treatment, so don't focus on this Remedy too much while ignoring the more
important/effective ones in treatment, but it might be good to keep this one in
mind if the other Heavy Metals don't work. Especially in women.... they use
cosmetics every day!

    Zinc is a protective mineral against Cadmium. And on the other hand,
    Cadmium can cause Zinc deficiency....

    Another major cause of Cadmium exposure is smoking. Fungicides used in
    Tobacco production and the papers around cigarettes contain huge amounts of
    Cadmium....

    "A single cigarette typically contains 1-2 mcg of cadmium. When burned,
    cadmium is present at a level of 1,000-3,000 ppb in the smoke.
    Approximately 40 to 60 percent of the cadmium inhaled from cigarette smoke
    is able to pass through the lungs and into the body. This means that for
    each pack of cigarettes smoked, a person can absorb an additional 1-3 mcg
    of cadmium over what is taken in from other sources in their daily life.
    Smokers typically have twice as much cadmium in their bodies as their
    nonsmoking counterparts."

    When Chernobyl hit Sweden - the hardest hit with a cloud that ended up
    raining on the northern half of that country - people were warned to not
    eat mushrooms and strawberries (which grow wild all over the country),
    because they are already the greatest "holders" of cadmium. They told
    people if they were going to eat these two foods, that they should at least
    'skin' them..

    Question:
    1. Would it be a good idea to run Cadmium/Strontium - especially on the
    mushrooms and strawberries that we eat - in the water we use to clean them
    - in the same way as Johan has taught about Pesticides/Insecticides?
    2. Can we also tell the clients who buy the Chikey about this?

    1. Yes... but remember this procedure has to be done with the two Glass
    Rods (or just the optic wires) in the Water at the same time the Produce is
    in there. If you would treat the Water first and then put the Produce in
    there this wouldn't work....

    I very much enjoy how we can use the two Glass Rods in the Water with the
    produce in there, all cut up already and run under a water filter first. I
    have already done this with food poisonings, as Johan taught in class. It
    does make the food taste better, even organic... but as we know, even
    organic food can be contaminated. Great to also add Cadmium/Strontium to
    all organic veggies form the west coast, I would think. ?

    When the Japanese earthquake happened, the radiation was carried in the

    Karolina: The entire west coast from Alaska down to Mexico was hit hard by
    the rains that came after Fukishima, and it continues (because Fukishima is
    not over and nobody knows for sure how long it will continue to spew
    toxins). It took all this time for the debris to reach the shores of
    California (you can see large buildings on the beaches in online footage or
    images). "Studies on sea vegetables with sodium alginate have shown that
    they selectively bound with radioactive strontium and eliminated it from
    the body. Sodium alginate is found in many seaweeds, especially kelp.
    Sodium alginate binds tightly to such substances as strontium, calcium,
    barium, cadmium and radium. Some seaweeds are contaminated with lead or
    arsenic so you only want to consume seaweed that is deep ocean harvested or
    has been tested to be free of metal toxicity (such as kelp from the west
    coast of South Africa)." There is much more online about all of this. I do
    think it's a good idea to add the Cadmium/Strontium with the food
    poisonings when putting the rods in the water to clear everything. I would
    think a lot of people out there need this inverted, too.

    Do we have Zinc in the Chiren? "zinc will also help the body eliminate
    several toxic heavy metals including cadmium, aluminum and lead." It would
    be great to get some zinc downloaded, or do we already have it?

    There's a big difference between Electricity (moving Electrons) and Light
    (Photons). Only Photons will be transmitted through the Fibre Optic Vables
    so there's no electricity involved, and no danger for electrocution/short

Is it okay to treat a client who is taking Votrient (panzopanib) => LINK

    Chemotherapy is very taxing for the body to process and detox. Chiren
    treatment will always increase detoxification even more, and especially so
    when you use nosodes or the high potencies in the Homaccords.

    Usually the advise is to wait until a round of chemotherapy is over and
    then to start regular sessions. But if you treat with care and only use low
    potency support remedies (Compositae) for the Liver, Kidneys and Lymphatic
    System his can assist the body to handle the chemo better. 

    Recommended are: Hepar, Galium, Lymphomyosot, Solidago, and Populus

    Do not neutralise the Votrient before she has stopped taking it completely.
    This will burden the body only more.

    hi Karoline.
   
    Thanks for your reply, but this drug is not chemo but an angiogenesis
    inhibitor. My client would like to be sure that Chiren treatment not
    counteract this medication. She have to take it  the rest of her life.
   
    I know, I have to focus on support here too :)
  •

    I would not risk it if the medication route is the one she wants to take.

    Angiogenesis is a healthy function of the body that is needed for tissue
    growth and healing. Restoring the light will always initiate an attempt of
    the body to repair and heal itself to its natural state… Angiogenesis will
    be a function that the body definitely needs to be healthy for self-healing
    to occur. 

    So this medication is an antagonist of the Chiren therapy and the Chiren
    therapy is an antagonist of the medication. If the medication wins there is
    therapy resistance, if the Chiren wins there will be angiogenesis even when
    the medication is taken. 

    But the question is what choice does your client want to make. Because
    choosing this medication will not remove the cause and is a way of
    suppressing the symptom (tumor), this is a valid choice to make if she
    feels it works for her. Biontology works on the underlying cause, however,
    and it will not be an additional route of healing, but a completely
    different one. You cannot have it all.

Q&A - Problem with Focussing

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
December 2013 edited December 2013 in Q&A Flag
Focussing on one item per session as Johan said, seems to be very difficult for
me.

Example of a first session:

Whiplash + Spin Inversion + Poliomyelitis + Anti-Tetanus...

I measure a problem with Calcification on Kidneys and Circulation
I measure drops on the Appendix and Tonsil points and need Chronic
Appendicitis, Appendicitis and Chronic Tonsillitis
Then I also measure Billiary Cirrhosis and Calculi Billiaris on the
Gallbladder, which means am loaded in my >12 yrs program and Dyslexia program.

So I have many problems to face instead of 1.

Treatment:
Poliomyelitis, Anti-Tetanus, Calculi Renalis, Chronic Appendicitis,
Appendicitis, Chronic Tonsillitis, Calculi Billiaris, Reneel.

Footplate Support:
Aurumheel, Barijodeel, Thalamus, Viscum, Lymphosot, Chelidonium,
Atropinum,.........

Question:
I wonder if I'm not working effectively...

    I have not said that you need to focus on just one meridian, but on one
    problem at the time.
    A Session should be focussed. It is not advisable nor necessary to get all
    the points balanced the first Session(s).

    The following advise is based on the description of your session and with
    the assumption that all points on Small and Large Intestine were corrected
    with the two Appendicitis Remedies. If there are any more points dropping
    on the Intestines that do not match those Nosodes, I might make different
    choices (i.e. Ulcers, Duodenitis, Gastritis, Food Poisonings,
    Tuberculinum).
    If the Kidneys would show more than the Kidney Stone point dropping, I
    would check if one of the Intestinal Bacteria would match.


    With this in mind, here is my advise on how to focus the session you
    described:

    In this example you should have focussed on the Triple Warmer and the Large
    Intestine, which needs to be treated before the Gallbladder  (= 5-element
    teaching, Metal destroys Wood). 
    Athough the Kidneys drop and only match to Kidney Stones there is no point
    in treating the Kidneys because the Calcium Metabolism has not been
    corrected as yet. You are only doing this in this treatment. So there is no
    use in trying to treat Kidney Stones or the Atherosclerosis.

    Treatment:

    Spin Inversion and Whiplash should always be treated when measured.
   
    The first Session the Triple Warmer might for example need 2 or 3 slots. In
    this case Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus.

    When your client has Calcification on Kidneys and Circulation it is not
    necessary or helpful to treat it immediately.
    * Calcification on Kidneys is always caused by Kidney Stones => which
    generally do not impair the excretion function of the Kidneys, so we leave
    it until the Calcium metabolism is corrected.
    * Calcification in the Arteries or Veins => is not helpful to be treated at
    this point because the Calcium Metabolism has not been healed yet. Only
    when during the assessment (before any treatment) the Parathyroid is
    without drops you can start treating Calcification.
    So if the Parathyroid is right the next session, then you can choose
    Barijodeel and Calculi Renales. 

    Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis and Chronic Tonsillitis are a cause of
    many problems and need to be addressed immediately. This takes 3 slots. Now
    we have a total of 5 or 6 slots taken. 
    In addition I would choose Anginheel and Tonsilla Compositum as Supports.

    I would leave the Gallbladder alone until a future session. 

    As (focussed!) Supports for the Footplates I would choose:
    Nux Vomica => excellent support for the Large Intestine
    Chelidonium => contains Belladonna, a great remedy for all localized
    infections (Appendix/Tonsils) and at the same time it supports the
    Gallbladder (which is not addressed with nosodes yet, but since the
    Gallbladder is dropping this remedy helps relax it)
    Mucosa => obviously the Mucous Membranes are affected. 
    Populus or Solidago => Kidneys support for detoxification that the
    treatment will initiate. 
    Lymphomyosot => Supports Lymph tissues (Appendix/Tonsils)

    It is also not necessary that all the slots are filled. Less is often
    better.

Treating Someone after a Coma ?

slevarekslevarek
April 2013 edited January 2014 in General Questions Flag
Client: Woman 41 years old (acquaintance), who just got out of a coma. She is a
mother of a 7 year old and is married. Her husband is totally overstressed.. I
have been asked to come to the house to treat her if possible.

History: 2 weeks ago (at a dance party) she felt sick.. started to throw up
repeatedly, passed out.. was airlifted to a hospital where they "induced" her
into a coma.

Current situation: Conscious, back home, can't do anything for herself,
communicates a little bit by sounds.. but can't speak normally, sort of like a
"stroke", one side of face paralyzed, has to learn to speak, move her arms and
legs.. .

Questions:
Can you advise me what you would do if you were in my shoes.. 
1. Where does one begin in such a situation? Do I begin with the standard
protocol of measuring on Endocrine system and is there going to be any issues
with her "detoxing" 
2. What should I be aware of? I have thought that she must be in a Spin
Inversion from being in the hospital and all. 
3. And if she can not hold the rods?
4. Also in order to do the Foot Plate Treatments.. any advice you can give me?

Thank you for any feedback you may provide.

    1. You just follow the protocol. Endocrine system first.
    Then, from the measurements, I hope you can determine the cause of this
    event.

    2. From the symptoms it seems to be a kind of Stroke. This Stroke could be
    caused by Calcified Cerebral Arteries combined with a rise in Blood
    Pressure.
    I think the repeatedly throwing up has risen the upwards Pressure of the
    Blood.

    If you find problems with the Calcification of the Cerebral Arteries, you
    need to clear the Parathyroid first, then address the Calcification. 

    But the Nausea is not normal for Strokes. The Throwing Up and the resulting
    Stroke appear to be results of something else that made her Vomit. It might
    be Alcohol or a Gallbladder/Stomach issue or perhaps a party drug.
    It could also be a Low Blood Sugar problem by not eating or eating the
    wrong thing which made her sick.
    You first need to measure and find out the cause

    Also in case of Stroke because of Calcification in combination with High
    Blood Pressure, be aware to relax the system (Atropinum). Sometimes after
    treatment if you overlook the Gallbladder, Blood Pressure can rise and if
    there are weak Veins this is not an effect you want.

    Thank you.. 
    I have now heard from others.. that some of these people at this party..
    decided to take  what they called "herbal ecstasy".. After taking it, she
    complained that her head was hurting.. and then the vomiting came next..
    I have looked it up online and they say this is Ephedra.. 

    But the medical doctor at the hospital does not believe this was the
    cause.. However, online, I did read it can cause a heart attack. So the
    throwing up was probably caused by what she took. She is a small person.
    I am scheduling the appointment now. 

    I will let you know the outcome. Appreciate your feedback.

    That definitely would be suspect for a cause! Crazy doctor who doesn't
    believe that.... 

    Ephedra is being used in Chinese Medicine, but is put on the black list (at
    least in the Netherlands) because it can be dangerous in the wrong dose and
    in sensitive people. It has also been abused by people to lose weight...

    " Ma huang (Ephedra) has been incorporated as an ingredient in a number of
    weight loss formulas over the past few years. However, its action is
    similar to that of adrenalin in that it stimulates the central nervous
    system, thereby increasing heartbeat and blood pressure. Therefore, ma
    huang should not be used by hypertensive people or by those with a heart
    condition."

Chiren Stops Working During Measurement Program

Renate
March 2013 edited March 2013 in Chiren Flag

After running a program:  Spin, Rods, etc.:  I go into the measurement program
and get no sound.  

All connections are secure.  The only way I can get it to start working again
is to click on the “back” button and then go back into the measurement
program.  Johan told me that this sometimes happens when the black cable that
goes to the golden rod becomes damaged and suggested that I replace it with the
orange or blue cable.  That has decreased the number of times the problem
happens but it still does occur. 

The problem is intermittent and always catches me by surprise.  I usually have
to touch the golden rod with my probe to make sure that it’s not working.  Then
my clients become concerned that we may not be able to finish their treatment. 
One client who is a reiki practitioner even started doing reiki on it before I
could remind her that she should not be doing any other energy therapies!

It would be helpful to know if anyone else has a similar problem with their
Chiren as I really don’t want to send it back to Germany unless absolutely
necessary.  

Thanks.

    I have had this with both of the Chirens I'm working with and thought this
    was "normal", never questioned it... 

    Since it doesn't effect the treatment or measurement I never bothered to
    ask... You just have to go back into the Measurement Program like you
    described. I've noticed that my mother's Chiren doesn't react in this way
    though....

    Yes I recognise this problem as well,  it started 2 days ago, I measured
    and no sound came out. I did the same and clicked on the back button, then
    it was fine for a couple of minutes. Normally the probe makes a sound when
    it touches the golden rod, and it didn't. I had to make it wet and clean
    the pen, I have to find out today if it will work during a session. Clients
    do get upset and think the whole treatment is incorrect!
    I am also worried something is wrong. should we not clean the pen?? Is it a
    cable problem??? So soon? I only have the Chiren a couple of months.
    I find it a big problem when there is something not working, then you need
    spare material just in case something do happens.  if we have to send the
    Chiren to Germany, how long will that take????

    It is very unlikely that you have to send your Chiren to Germany for this.
    If the Chiren doesn't give a sound at all anymore (different problem then
    having to go back to the Measurement program to get a sound) the wire is
    probably broken inside. 
    You have to be careful with those wires, when they get knotted or entangled
    they can break.... If your black wire is broken you can always use the blue
    or orange one as a spare part.

    Hi Karolina

    It is news for me that the coloured wires are interchangable with the
    fiberoptic black wires?

    I thought they were just for bodyscars.

    Hi Beate,

    They are not interchangeable with the fiberoptics! 

    We were discussing the measurement, and the black wire I was referring to
    is the one that connects with the metal rod. Sometimes this breaks and you
    won't get a sound anymore. In this case you can use the coloured wires.

    Chiren shuts down or doesn't work

    I have found that if I always press "Measurement" between everything -- and
    sometimes I need to press it twice to get the copper rod to work when
    measuring hands or feet -- it works. If I press "Back" - it either doesn't
    work at all or the Chiren simply shuts itself down. I wrote to Germany
    about this. Not sure what is causing this. I cannot use the BACK except
    when the patient is on the footplates and I am in the Dyslexia program 
    (when I want to remove and add other nosodes/supports during the 16
    minutes). Thank goodness that works! But it adds to the time and it
    disturbs the free flow of intuition when one has to 'think' before
    proceeding with the software ... It is definitely a glitch in the software
    and perhaps the genius who built the Chiren can find it and do an update
    for all of us who have this problem?

    Thank you.

Intestinal Bacteria & Appendicitis

YmkjeYmkje
February 2013 edited January 2014 in General Questions Flag

Question:

1. What I understood in class is that when the Inflammatory (-itis) problems of
Appendix and/or Tonsils not have been solved yet, you should not use the
Intestinal Bacteria, because when given too early, it can create problems
elsewhere for example on the Bladder or the Gallbladder. Have I understood this
right?

2. When you measure Appendicitis Necroticans, is it best to use Chronic
Appendicitis and Appendicitis too? And in case of ChronicTonsillitis, is it
best to use Tonsillitis too?
Someone explained to me, that usually not the whole Appendix needs Appendicitis
Necroticans, and that there is also tissue that might need the Chronic
Appendicitis and/or the Acute Appendicitis Nosodes...

3. I have experienced that it is possible after a few treatments, that the
Appendix Point measures well, but that Appendicitis might still correct drops
on other Organ Systems. Can I trust my Measurement of the Appendix Point, or is
there something I don't understand?

    Answers:
    1. When you use the Intestinal Bacteria in your Chiren Treatment before the
    Intestines are healthy it won't work, but it doesn't create problems. 
   
    Sometimes one of the Bacteria can be needed in Treatment:
    Intestines that don't have a good climate for the healthy Intestinal
    Bacteria will cause these bacteria to spread in the body to other organs
    where they don't belong and will cause infection. They can for example
    infect the Bladder or Gallbladder. If you measure this you can use the
    Bacteria Remedies to treat these Infections too, because the Intestinal
    Bacteria Remedies have Potencies that help to fight Infection caused by the
    Bacteria, but also a Potency that helps to stimulate their Growth in the
    Intestines.
   
    What you might have heard in class: Taking Probiotics in a supplements when
    there's no healthy climate in the Intestines because of Infection/
    Inflammation can also cause these Bacteria to spread into tissues and
    Organs where they don't belong. This is why I always advise against taking
    them.
   
    2. I only use Appendicitis in case of Chronic Appendicitis, because I want
    to prevent an acute flare up of the Appendicitis after treatment. I don't
    do this with Chronic tonsillitis or with Appendicitis Necroticans (next
    step will be Chronic Appendicitis so not acute)

    I always focus on what is showing up in the Measurements. If after using
    Appendicitis Necroticans, there are other points that still drop and are
    corrected with Chronic Appendicitis then I will use this Remedy too of
    course. But if everything is corrected with Appendicitis Necroticans
    there's no need to use the other Remedies. The body show when the next step
    is needed...

    I've experimented with using all stages in one treatment for a while. But I
    don't see it has an extra beneficial effect. It only takes up space.

    Recipes, in my experience, never work optimal. It is always best to measure
    and judge every situation by itself.

    Thanks for answering so quickly! 

    Is it right that when Appendicitis solves a problem at an another Organ
    System (for example at the Triple Warmer left), while the Appendix point
    measured well I have missed something and I measured wrong?

Symptoms Getting Worse - MS or Parasites

Henry Gwynn
March 2013 edited February 2014 in General Questions Flag
Medical diagnoses: MS or parasites, MRI revealed small lesions all over her
central and peripheral nervous system. 

Symptoms before treatment: Tingling and numbness of the feet and lower legs,
and pain in the hip, yet she could go on long walks and garden. 

Symptoms after treatment: Tingling has gotten worse, the tingling and numbness
is now in all of her legs and in her hands, The pain has gotten better. 

I think her Nervous and Circulatory systems have been damaged by the parasite,
yet I don't understand why the numbness would get worse. Below are her
measurements and remedies. Any insight on this case would be appreciated. 

Measurement:
Small Intestines (left and right) - lowest points
Heart (left and right) - lowest points
Appendix point 
Triple Warmer - Pancreas point TW1b. 
Nervous system (left) - lowest two points 
Circulation (left and right) - lowest two points
veins (left) - lowest two points 

Treatment:
Trichonomaden (for the nervous system), Circulo and Placenta (for Circulation
and Veins), Nervoheel (for the Nervous System), Appendicitis (for the
Appendix), Cactus Compositum (for the Heart), Salmonella (for the Small
Intestine).

The feet didn't have drops, so I used Echinacea, Trichonomaden, Circulo,
Nervoheel, Cerebrum, Viscum, and Thalamus.

    She is in her early forties. The appendicitis did go to chronic the next
    session because she couldnt see me for 7 days. I treated her for chronic
    appendicitis and appendicitis hopefully it will help. Thanks for the help

    How many treatments did you have before this one? And what did you find
    there? 

    Pain in the hip is always caused by the Gallbladder meridian and numbness
    by poor circulation, which is often a result of Gallbladder problems.

    I do not think it has anything to do with MS or parasites.

    Treat with Barijodeel, Aurumheel Aesculus, Circulo for her circulation (if
    you measure this). If there is no calcification then treat the Gallbladder
    first and perhaps the Circulation at the same time.

    The reason why the numbness got worse is that the stress on the body got
    increased, with the result that the Gallbladder got worse and the
    constriction of the Blood Vessels also got worse.
    The stress on the body got worse because the treatment followed the wrong
    sequence.

Asbestos

janjan
January 2013 edited January 2014 in Toxins Flag
I know Johan has always said asbestos, even if there is one fiber, is difficult
to resolve.... Can you please assist in addessing this question from a client
so that I may give her a realistic answer.

"Chrissi had a huge exposure to Asbestos as a child. A year ago she was given 6
months to live. She has gone the medical route doing everything available to
prolong her life. We just found out her tumors are rapidly growing, there is a
large tumor near her heart, a large tumor in her right lung and now in the
latest discovery there is a tumor growing into the liver.

Given the state of her condition do you feel Biophoton treatment can help her?

    The actual asbestos fibers are very hard if not impossible for the body to
    remove, so getting rid of the cause might be a problem.

    However there are known cases of spontaneous remission in mesothelioma and
    this gives hope. If it happened before it is not completely impossibility
    for the human body to become cancer (symptom) free again. I do think that
    even if this is going to work ongoing treatment is needed because the
    asbestos fibers (cause) will still be there, even if the cancer symptoms
    are gone.

    The condition of your client sounds pretty severe though, often liver
    cancer is found after chemotherapy has been administered. Did she receive
    chemotherapy? The toxic load and damage because of chemo is huge and this
    is an extra burden the body has to deal with... 

    I wouldn't make any promise in this case. It is a matter of trying to see
    what the body is still capable of resolving. You know from experience that
    that is often remarkable, but sometimes it is just not possible anymore.
    Who knows.... 
    And if someone is given up some symptom relief can be a huge gift too. 

    I hope this was somewhat helpful,

    There are even more remedies to measure on in case of cancer and
    degeneration. I beleive the best thing to do is to read the manual the
    Nosode and Compositae list once and a while to keep the different ones in
    mind by the time of measuring. 
    At time of Cancer, to support Liver, Kidney, organ involved is imporant to
    keep the body going. Detox can be on Circulation both Arteries and Veins,
    even Lung points can match on detox remedies. 
    the Lymphatic tissue; Tonsilla Compositum and Lympomyosot is often matching
    and lightning the process of the body,
    Selenium and Berberis for Adrenal Glands and other organs gain well by
    these remedies too.
     but it MUST be measured out what matches particulary on a person. it is
    often a mistake to add what is most common instead of measuring what the
    body is asking for. We'll might be suprised that assumptions on behalf of
    clients body is not matching reality.

    Thank you Nora ( I have 5 copies of the nosodes and comps and the
    correlations - one by my bed one in the car, one in the office, one where I
    work and one in the book!  Whenever I have a few minutes I read ... its
    amazing how many times one or two just jump out at you as relevant to
    measure on a client, even tho you've seen them so many times before!)

    In my ongoing pre appointment communications with this woman who seems so
    brave, she just wrote this. "I'm having cryo ablation done tomorrow on two
    of the tumors, the one heading into my liver and another one, this is
    mainly done for pain control. It's a fancy name for freezing. I am also
    still on a pill form of chemo, which we are fairly confident is not
    working.  

    An area I am still a little confused on is the area of medication.  Early
    on we were told to neutralize it, then later on we were told not to
    neutralize it...  What I am wondering is can we get an accurate measurement
    of the body if we are reading through chemo pills?  

    All the prior cancer clients I have worked with were off of chemo.

    Hi Jan,

    As long as chemo is administered you should work with that situation, which
    unfortunately is the reality for now. If you would neutralize the chemo
    this will give a reading which is misleading, since the body still is
    continuously going to be burdened by the same toxins after the treatment.
    Your session is not going to prepare the body for that if you don't include
    the chemo as an influence in the body. 

    So it is best to work with this reality of continuous toxicity and find out
    which (detox) remedies help the body to detoxify and balance itself while
    using chemo/medication and then, when the chemo is no longer given to her,
    you can neutralize it just once.

    for a week from Monday 6 days after the CT scan. 

    Question:
    As the dye is Iodine which has gone through all organs, will that affect my

    more than others?

    Anacardium Homaccord has high potency (D30, D200, D1000) Iodine. So this
    might help the body with the clean up.

    But Iodine dyes are especially harmful to the kidneys, so I would focus on
    supporting them. 
    And of course also Circulation. I expect drops to show up on veins and
    arteries because of the foreign substance that is injected straight into
    the circulation....

    My mesothelomia client is continuing with me, some tumors have grown, some

    (cryo) to destroy or damage tissue) next Thursday.
   
    Question:  She is wondering if coming in just before the ablation treatment
    is best or, just after.  
    My thought would be after to help detox from the destruction of cells, or
    ... would it be better to support her body prior for the process. It is
    always so painful for her.

    Question: Is it true that we can measure supplements or medications in the
    cup or footplates using the Pituitary point to measure if the body accepts
    the substance or rejects it? I think I overheard someone in a class talk
    about how they did this to decide whether to neutralize something or not.
    It was thought to be like 'muscle testing' with energy work. Thank you for
    a clarification on this.

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    March 2013 edited March 2013 Flag
    This is not how it works. Chiren measurement is not the same as the
    generalistic muscle-testing procedure, it is organ-specific and should be
    used like this.

    Not every supplement or medication that is bad will have the same effect on
    the same organ system. A substance might not cause a drop on the Pituitary
    for example, but at the same time create drops on the Stomach. So to just
    test on the Pituitary shows a lack of understanding of Biontology. In fact
    to get a real clue on what a substance does, you should test all organ
    systems with it.... 

    But...

    Another concern about testing substances, Johan has right now, is that
    everything changes after it enters the digestive tract. So an ingested pill
    is not the same anymore as it was before the body worked on it... This
    makes a lot of sense, since digestion is the braking down of chemicals into
    other chemicals. These chemicals can be harmful, while the original
    substance is not and might test as innocent. Or the other way around of
    course... (Another thing that happens is that substances are transformed
    energetically through digestion)

    So right now I would personally only neutralize medication just once, when
    a client's symptoms are clearly related to the drug, and he/she has stopped
    taking it. This is not my common practice anymore, it is an exception.
    Johan hardly ever neutralizes medication (I have never seen him do it
    personally and sat in on many of his treatments). Usually side effects will
    be dealt with by working on the whole system.

    I have a question.  Aren't we asking the "knowing" of the body? And if so,
    the knowing of the body would respond appropriately as to what the effect
    of the medication tested would be wherever it was tested. 

     So... I had for instance a substance "cell food" in liquid form that a
    client was taking and I thought it was actually draining his adrenals
    because it was continually boosting them so much.  The only way I could
    convince him was to measure it on his systems...fine on all systems
    but...the adrenals!!! Yes, it was draining the adrenals. When he stopped it
    for 2 weeks (because he believed the chiren test) his adrenals corrected. 
     
    In asking the body for certain things the client is clinging to or wonders
    about, and certain organs say yes and often others, particularly the
    kidneys, say no, I have felt we can trust the body is answering us in the
    way it "knows" it receives the substance processed by digestion and all. 

    Wouldn't divine intelligence of the body work that way through the chiren?

    Yes in theory this is exactly what should happen. Johan is not convinced

    this.
    It is more convincing for a client to see how something measures, than to
    hear something I suggest. 

    It is easy to influence the outcome though and since you already had a
    hunch, this might have been what you've measured too. Nothing wrong with
    intuition, but you "knew" what you were going to measure for so it was not
    objective anymore.

    I believe in an optimal situation without projection this could work. But
    it is interesting to see that testing outcomes of supplements/drugs greatly
    vary with the practitioner. Some practitioners who firmly believe in all
    kinds of supplements test them positive always, while Johan and I usually
    test them to be negative especially for the digestive tract. 

    Divine intelligence works best without thinking or assumptions.

    Testing a substance means always testing the substance in the format that
    is offered, i.e. the substance as it is placed in the cup. This should
    always be inaccurate as it is never the substance that is in the digestive
    tract.

    It is also a question on which points to measure. I feel if you do this,
    you should measure on all the points. I have done this quite a few times
    and there have always been points dropping on whatever supplement or
    medication I tested.

    I think the body is divine and it should lead us, never project anything
    onto it

    Thank you for the reminders about projection. I know that in classes we
    were taught that intuition and synthesis thinking are a part of this, I
    guess it is a fine line between thinking something might be based on the
    "evidence" and projecting something might be.

    You are so right Jan! It is a very fine line... 

    Intuition comes from a basis of both knowledge and experience, but then it
    happens without thinking... Synthesis thinking is also a kind of intuition
    that integrates all the knowledge and insight that was previously gathered
    and then when needed it just pops up. 

    When measuring I always try to be completely blank... without any
    assumptions like in meditation.

    This was a great discussion. I don't know how I missed the rest of it!
    Thank you Johan and Karolina for going into detail, and thank you Jan for
    such great questions. 
    It feels exactly the same as when I am measuring for geopathic stress with
    a frequency rod, I become like an empty vessel, and with the Chiren it
    feels the same to me in many ways.

    Question: Johan, how do you feel about this? If one is "completely blank,
    without any assumptions" How does one know the body being tested is giving
    the right answer? 
    Is there a way to test the person to make sure you are getting the right
    results from them? 
    I think some people are brilliant at hiding everything behind their health
    issues, and they don't want to let go of them so easily. They have become
    their 'story' ...  and what would they do without them!?

    PS
    I don't just use any remedy that pops into me! I always measure and match
    first while my intuition comes from the foundation of the knowledge I have
    and am developing. 
    (Still learning the 5 Element Theory (not taught sufficiently in our
    course), latest Correlations from Johan work well most of the time) 
   
    We are in the quantum field, so there's no separation between us and our
    client, when we are working with someone. So we 'get' our intuition to work
    beautifully. 
   
    As you wrote above, the results can be different, and I think that is
    because the Chiren becomes an extension of ourselves - or the other way
    around! I saw that Johan wrote something recently here in the Forum that
    for me was the perfect explanation about quantum mechanics and how we work.
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    May 2013 edited May 2013 Flag
    To make things clear:
    The Chiren is not becoming an extension of the practitioner. It is an
    instrument that lets the body of the client communicate with the
    practitioner in a very simple language.
    The only thing that a practitioner has to do is to listen to what the
    client and their body has to tell and to do what the body wants.

    What often is experienced as intuition is nothing else than projection.
    That is why I always say to be objective and never judge anybody or
    anything. I've seen too many ineffective and crazy things come from "
    Intuition".

    Although we are in a quantum field, there is a lot of separation between
    everything and everybody. We all vibrate at a different level in the same
    field. There is normally no connection between the various vibrations. 

    Only the vibrations that resonate with you personally will be registered,
    that is why you can never fully "know" another person and that is also why
    the assumptions one has say most about oneself. That is why we ASK and
    don't assume in Biontology. The only one who knows the answers is the
    client.

screws
Hip replacement => redone twice (right side)
Stress fractures lower spine
Squamous cell cancer surgery - left gum/jaw (metal plate)
Severe nail fungus on toes

1st Session:
Scar treatment/whiplash/spin
Measured with Plumbun, Atropinum, Viscum
Large Intestine (L) - 4 pts (R) - proximal
Lymphatic (R+L) - 2 pts.
Nervous System (R+L) proximal
Circulation/Arteries = (R+L) midpoints
Hormone (L) - Hypoglycemic

Footplates:
Toxoplasmosis, Natrium, Neuralgo Rheum, Nox Vomica, Viscum,Thalamus, Cerebrum

Final measurement:
Large Intestine still dropping - Lymph L ear point


6th Session

1st Measurement:
Hormone (L) 2 lower (R) - Thymus/Diabetic Insulin
Circulation/Veins (L)
Lymphatic (L)

>12 Treatment:
Selenium, Berberis, Biliary Cirrhosis, Cholecystitis, Mellilotus,Pladenta,

2nd Measurement:
All balanced , except Lymphatic (L) ear

Footplates:
Tonsillitis, Arnica, Atropinum, Osteoheel, Ozaliet, Tonico, Flannel Flower,
Lymphomosot

Final Measurement:
Circulation/Veins (L) - all dropping

Questions:
1. There have been few points dropping on the feet, 1 or 2 on kidneys in early
sessions. Could this be caused by scars?

2. When I did the original scar treatment, I used Procranium thinking this
would help internal scars. Should I repeat the treatment with no remedies?

3. She has had no improvement of symptoms at all - after clearing many dropping
meridians. Does this seem normal? Given her situation, I wonder how much will
be possible. Endorphin blocking? Therapy resistance?

4. There seem to be few nosodes to use for the Circulation/Veins. Aurumheel and
Barijodeel no longer correct drops. Other suggestions?

5. I know cancer is a symptom and suspect the cause is still active. How best
to search for this?

6. Kieferiostitis and the other dental remedies measure positive on the Jaw
point, even though there are no drops.
Should I treat with these remedies?

    Question:
    1.  I'm thinking that Gallbladder suppression is being lifted, being shown
    by leg cramping
         symptoms and Diabetic point dropping.  Does this seem right, even
    though the Gallbladder
         points are still not dropping?

    Comments on the first post:
    You did not give important details on the various sessions, so I do not
    know all I need to know.

    Did your client not receive a Tetanus vaccination? This should have been
    treated in the first session. Did you use Anti-Tetanus in one of the
    sessions you did not give the details of?

    She had a hysterectomy => Bladder points should still indicate the tumour
    if there was one to begin with (energetically things don't change after the
    removal of an organ). Did they?

    The fact that she does have artificial hips does not make the situation any
    easier. The new hips are an eternal disturbance.

    Answers:
    1, 2 & 3. There could be scars, but once you have treated them, the scars
    should not be blocking anymore. There could still be endorphins though
    stemming from a different cause. Especially on the Liver.
    There also could be therapy resistance if there is no physical improvement
    but energetically things are improving. You can try to give the therapy
    resistance remedies: Schwefheel and Psorinum

    4. I wonder if the Parathyroid was corrected at all. You did not mention
    using Anti-Tetanus and this always disturbs the Parathyroid. Before the
    Parathyroid is balanced Barijodeel and Aurumheel are of little use.
    You could also try Atropinum, Aesculus.

    5. Why search for cancer if there is no indication? There are some things
    in her medical history that make me wonder: What were the exact problems
    when she had her hysterectomy, and did she in fact have cancer? You have to
    look at the symptoms and work with them.

    The symptoms that she is experiencing indicate:
    Gallbladder problems => cramping bloodvessels in her leg or one leg might
    also have a different length, which is also caused by the Gallblader. One
    should check for this.
    => The fact that she overworked also gives Gallbladder problems.
    => Hip pain is also caused by the Gallbladder.

    Liver and/or Adrenal problems => The fatigue is either a Liver problem or
    exhausted Adrenal glands or both. 
    => The fact that she goes to bed at 3 am indicates also Liver & Gallbladder
    problems. I do not know whether they showed up at any one time but I think
    that is where the cause lies, and they do not go away easily. Especially
    after that many misdiagnoses.
   
    6. When there are no drops there is no way to use a point to measure
    positive for a remedy. The only measurement you should use are a. STEEP
    DROP, b. SLOW DROP, c. NO DROP

    Comments on the second post:

    * The Gallbladder drops will probably come back together with the Liver
    since this organ has not shown itself. 
    * Cramping might also be caused by Copper poisoning, for which you may use
    Cuprum
    * Pain is often caused by meridians or lack of circulation in a particular
    area. There are still two points on the Circulation that are not
    corrected...

    Thank you Johan for your reply.
   
    Your comments on the first post:
   
    *  I did not give Anti-Tetanus because she said she had never had the
    Tetanus vaccine.  
        Should I give it anyway? 

    *  The hysterectomy was due to a very large fibroid tumor - not cancerous

    *  The Bladder (L) nail points were dropping on sessions 1,4 & 5
        session 2 - all (L) Bladder points dropped.  No more drops the last 2
    sessions.

    *  She has had one hip replacement (R) which needed to be redone twice.
        She is thinking of having the (L) done now which to me seems like a
        very bad idea, especially at her age.

    Your answers:
   
    1,2 & 3.  I wonder if endorphins could be coming from her constant need to
    be busy.
    The Liver/ Pancreas (R) nail points only dropped once on session 4 which
    was also 
    the first session where there was no Appendicitis.  Please clarify how
    endorphins 
    could be caused by the liver?  I will try Schwefheel & Psorinum.
   
    4.  Anti-tetanus was not given as she was never vaccinated.  Parathyroid
    has not 
    shown any drops although she has been disgnosed with osteoporosis and takes
    calcium supplements (which I know make matters worse).  I will try
    Atropinum &
    Aesculus.
   
    5.  I was thinking about the jaw cancer in 2007, and wondering what that
    underlying cause
    might have been.  Yes, I was thinking Liver and Gallbladder also.  The
    Gallbladder has
    never had any drops, and the Liver (R) nail point only once on session 4.
    The Insulin/Diabetic point has dropped on the last 3 sessions and I have
    used
    Gallbladder remedies for that.

    Gallbladder problems:

    * Yes, she did just tell me that her left leg was shorter, and so I will do
    that treatment.

    * She has told me that eating mustard will stop the cramps immediately. 
    I wondered if this was a clue.  She has had no cramps since the last
    session.

    * I will check for Copper poisoning.

    Recent Surgery
    Hip replacement (April 22nd) => surgery went well (no blood transfusions)
    => month of rehabilitation, then home

    Symptoms Following Surgery
    Very little pain => Tylenol for only 2 weeks
   
    Chiren Sessions
    I resumed Chiren treatments in June
   
    Areas of Focus 
    Scar Treatment
    Whiplash Treatment
    Spin Inversion Treatment 
    Kidneys
    Adrenals
    Bladder
    Large Intestine
    Gallbladder
    Thyroid

    Circulation/Veins had been cleared before surgery and remained clear.  
   
    Ongoing issues
    Adrenals  => she has the habit of doing too much (despite my advice)
    Food poisoning 
    Pesticides => continued to affect the Thyroid => extreme pesticide issue in
    her living environment

    11th Session (18/8) 
    Situation at the time 
    Left ankle (broken in 1978, and troubling her since) => no longer swollen,
    more mobility, almost no pain 

    The swelling had been very gradually diminishing over the course of several
    weeks.

    18th Session (10/15)
    Situation at the time
    Feels better than she has in years
   
    Measurement:
    No drops

    Comments
    I treated mom for a total of 48 sessions.  This was quite a lot, due to my
    inexperience.  Looking back, I can see many things I would have done
    differently, and would have focused more directly on the Kidneys.
    I also can see how her resistance to alter her lifestyle negatively
    impacted treatments, as well as the continuing environmental influence of
    pesticides.  It is Fall now, so pesticides are less of an issue.

    I learned so much from these treatments, and feel very encouraged by the
    most surprising improvement in her ankle.
   
    Question
    The Liver never showed any dropping points during the whole length of
    treatment, despite measuring with endorphin remedies.  Do you have any
    advice on this situation?  
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    October 2015 Flag
    Answer
    The fact that the Liver has never dropped leads to the assumption that the
    Liver is still very toxic and still under a lot of stress. 

    The hip replacement is an indication of Gallbladder issues, behind the
    Gallbladder is likely to be the Liver. Behind these two there is an Adrenal
    issue, and on top of that there is the toxic environment.
    There seems to be a lack of acceptance to her diminished capabilities,
    which causes resistance to changing her lifestyle. That is why her Adrenals
    remain a continuous issue. Adrenals are for performance and if that is not
    there anymore as it was she feels stressed and thus endorphins might be
    everywhere.
    In order for her body to get a chance to really heal, she should slow down.

    48 sessions is a lot. My advice would be to let it rest for a while. I
    think the endorphins will only disappear when she has less pressure put on
    her. I suspect there is even pressure on her because also in the treatments
    she has to perform. It is this pressure to perform and perhaps also
    perfectionism that leads to exhausted Adrenals and endorphins. It likely is
    a pattern in her life that applies to everything. 

    So let it rest of one or two months, then measure again. Focus on Adrenals,
    Kidneys, Gallbladder and Liver (when the other systems have improved
    enough).

    Fear of change may also be part of the problem. I suggest you do not do
    treatments during this time but TALK to your mother and ask questions. Only
    that way she might be releasing suppressed feelings and with that
    suppression might go too.

    of these same tendencies myself, which gratefully I have let go of. It has
    turned out that I will continue to live here with her for the winter, which

    My experience with a 'diagnosis' history has been positive.  An elderly man
    had chlamydia trachomatis, years ago and was treated with antibiotics.  He
    has a enlarged prostate.  I measured for it on the sex gland, bladder
    meridian and it fixed the drop.  He then 'expressed' the suppression that
    week with mild pain on urination, slight blood in his ejaculation (at 72
    years old) and reported relief within the five days of treatment.  He then
    reported improved urination, sex and attitude.  He has been a relatively
    negative person, always feeling obliged to help his children and somewhat
    macho, some of the indications of the remedy.  His wife reported improved,
    positivity in his attitude.  He has also been diagnosed with reiter's
    syndrome, now referred to as reactive arthritis and chlamydia t. is often
    in the history. 

    So my take is if a diagnosis corrects the drop you probably got some good
    information.

Q&A - No Response to Treatment

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
December 2013 edited December 2013 in Q&A Flag
Client:
Woman in her 60’s, received one session.

Symptoms:
Fear, Anxiety, etc. (most of her issues were non-physical) 
Waking up very restless but not tired (only physical symptom) 

Treatment:
Whiplash
Only 4 of the 6 Spin Inversion points dropped. 

Overall, about ½ or so her points dropped and they were not steep drops. 

We ran through the regular protocol and nothing really resonated with her. 

Questions:   
1. Do some folks never resonate? 
2. Would the points not resonating indicate a Spin Inversion as well?
3. If I understand a Spin Inversion correctly, it is either deduced by the 6
points dropping or when someone after receiving the hand rods treatment does
not experience any improvement.

    1&2. I have never experienced that nothing resonates.

    3. The 6 points with steep drops indicate spin

    When the same points drops after the handtreatment as before the treatment,
    it indicate Hidden Spin Inversion

    With a lot of not very steep drops overall, indicate inflamation/infection
    and I would try Appendicitis Necroticans.

    1. I need to know what is meant by "nothing really resonated". 
    * When remedies matched in the measurement and corrected the drops in
    treatment, but nothing was felt by the client after just one treatment,
    this is not uncommon and doesn't tell you anything.
    * When no remedy matched in the measurement, then that is very strange.
    There might be a measurement problem (i.e. hand lotion)...

    2. No. Even when there is a Hidden Spin Inversion, points do resonate and
    react in the measurement. Only the treatment will not have any effect. 

    3. Spin Inversion is indeed indicated by the 6 points dropping steeply. 
    But not experiencing any improvement after a hand treatment is not an
    indication for Spin Inversion. When the points don't react and show exactly
    the same drops after the hand treatment this shows a Hidden Spin Inversion.

Arthrosis of the Hip

George
March 2013 edited February 2014 in Symptoms Flag
A woman who has been diagnosed with arthrosis of the hip has shown interest in
treatment. At the hospital photos were taken of her hip joint and according to
the docters the cartilage in the joint was worn away. She experiences decreased
mobility in the hip, stiffness and some pain.

My question is this: In a case where the cartilage in the joint has been worn
away will biophoton therapy be able to reverse the process, so that the
cartilage will grow back again and she will enjoy more (full?) mobility in her
hip again?

If I were to treat her I would of course start with the standard protocol. What
suggestions do you have for specific treatment of her hip? What remedies could
I test and on what points? Would it be useful to treat the whole gallbladder
meridian with the glass rods? Other suggestions?

Thanks in advance for your answers :-)

    Many people are diagnosed with this erosion of the cartilage, as if this
    should be the cause of the problems that the client experiences. But in my
    experience the cause of the symptoms lies in the Gallbladder and
    Circulation.

    1) The cartilage and the bone can regenerate
        Use in this case: Discus, Osteoheel and Calcoheel

    2) The experienced symptoms are rarely caused by the erosion. Pains come
    from Gallbladder meridian disturbances and Circulation problems. Lack of
    mobility can also come from these Gallbladder or Circulation disturbances.

    The problems with one hip/leg can lead to increased tension of the muscles
    in this leg, which will make the leg shorter which also leads to less
    mobility. 
    It also leads to a crooked pelvis which again will lead to pain in the
    back. You have to make sure that the muscles in each leg have the same
    tension so that the legs have the same length

    It took me some time to find this information in the forum again, so to
    make Johan's post more available I will copy/paste below what Johan said in
    another thread about leg extension.

    My question
    How do I measure length differences of a client's legs?


    Johan on leg extension:
    "Difference in the length of legs is most of the time caused by muscle
    tension.

    You need to release the tension in the shorter leg. You can do this by
    means of the electrical system and the blue and orange wires with the
    connectors at the end.

    Treatment for the shorter leg: One connector you place at the end point of
    the Gallbladder meridian. This wire must be connected with the input of the
    Chiren so that the flow goes from point to the Chiren. On the other wire
    you put the golden rod and connect it with the output of the Chiren. The
    rod is placed in the hand of the client.

    So
    you take the energy from the Gallbladder and give it to the whole body.
    Then you start the treatment from 0-2 years.( 1minute). After this
    treatment you test the legs again. If they have not reached the same
    length, you do the program another time. You can do this three times on a
    leg.

    Treatment for the longer leg: If this is not enough, you can do the 
    opposite on the other, longer, leg. You need to bring energy to the
    Gallbladder.

    This way I can solve a difference of up to 4 cm."

    Right after amalgam removal and during mercury detox is it preferable to
    give clients a full chiren treatment or a child's treatment with support
    remedies?.

    It is best to use the protocol as usual, is what Johan meant.
    Make sure that the Hormone System and Kidneys are OK at least, and for this
    you need to treat them with nosodes... don't use Toxins/Heavy Metals, but
    that wouldn't be in line with the protocol anyway.

    If the client is an adult use the >12 Standard Program... This program is
    phased so the body has time to adapt. For adults the >12 Standard Program
    is the better choice.

    If you are already treating this client normally, then there is no need for
    an extra treatment with supports beforehand. After the procedure you may
    want to measure again and see what is necessary. I would use all Kidney
    supports and also Gallbladder support.

    I will stick to protocol and would never add heavy metals carelessly. That
    lesson and warning has fortunately stuck with me since Basic One training

Hi There,  Johan suggested I treat my cat for intestinal flora. I regret that I
didn't ask him which remedies specifically. I found 5 nosodes for intestinal
flora, and I can't find any supports. Can you tell me which nosodes and
supports I should give him? If this were a person I would test, but of course
you can't test with animals.  Thanks so much!!

    Hi Sondra and Sondra's cat ;)

    The 4 ProBiotics in the Chiren are:

    * Bact Proteus
    * Bact Coli
    * Bact Lactis
    * Bact Pyo

    (Bact Dysenterie is not a ProBiotic, it is a bacteria that causes Diarrea.)

    Hi Kat, Thank you so much for your answer for Merlin's treatment. That was
    so nice of you! Do you think I should give him all 5 nosodes for intestinal
    flora, and all 4 supports (are you saying that the probiotics are the
    supports for intestinal flora)?  Thanks so much for your help, I appreciate
    it! Love, Sondra

    Hi Sondra!

    the 4 probiotics described above are no nosodes as I understood, they need
    no support. 
    Bact Dysenterie is not a probiotic, this I believe is a nosode, but this is
    not the remedy you might need for your cat...(unless it has diarrhea).

    I don't know Merlin's symptoms...depending on those there could be other
    helpful remedies...like aluminum, mercury, vaccines, etc.

    Thank you so much Kat. I would love to get confirmation from Karolina or
    Johan before treating Merlin, just to be extra sure, so I'll wait alittle,
    hopefully one of them will be able to answer. Just to clarify for them,
    Johan suggested I treat my cat for intestinal flora. I found 5 nosodes
    listed under intestinal flora. Should I give him all of these, and what are
    the supports I should give with that? Thanks so much!

    I didn't respond since Kat already gave the right information ;-)

    All remedies of bacteria are nosodes. 

    Bact. Proteus, Lactis, Pyo and Coli are all supportive to Intestinal Flora,
    but at the same time can act as a remedy for infections caused by these
    bacteria in other organ systems than the bowels. 

    Klebsiella I put in the remedy list as Intestinal Flora since it is part of
    the natural Flora in about 40% of the people. It will only create problems
    when it starts to infect different areas of the body, most importantly the
    Lungs... This nosode is not used as intestinal support.

    So you can use all 4 bacteria at once for your cat and maybe Mucosa as a
    support.

    * Spin Inversion is measured on the left hand. 

    * The 6 Spin Inversion points are:
    1. Pituitary
    2. Parathyroid
    3. The two upper (proximal) points on the Heart meridian
    4. The two upper (proximal) points on the Circulation meridian

    * Assessment of Spin Inversion => the 6 Spin Inversion points all drop
    steeply

    * Treatment of Spin Inversion => put the copper spiral in the cup => put a
    small piece of tissue with a drop of blood in the centre of the spiral =>
    run the Spin Inversion Program

    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    February 2014 Flag
    Without specific information and only a diagnosis we actually have nothing…
    it is the client who is central 
   
    How old is he?
    When did the symptoms start?
    What are his other symptoms?
    What medical procedures and drugs did he get?
    Are there environmental and/or lifestyle implications?
    Etc.
   
    For now I would suggest to just start with the normal protocol and see how
    this affects things. 
    First see what is needed to correct the Hormone System. The vaccinations
    might be a major causal factor as well as possible Whiplash.
   
    Anti-Tetanus and Poliomyelitis alone might give a lot of improvement…. Also
    use Spascupreel and maybe Atropinum as support. 
   
    Calcium metabolism (Parathyroid) is very important to restore in dystonia,
    as well as circulation, but of course you will get to that anyway when you
    follow the right order of treatment.
   
    When the Hormone System is completely balanced please come back and discuss
    the symptoms and drops that are still there. 
   
    Muscle strength and control is Liver/Gallbladder, so for sure you will find
    problems there too.

EES - The Energy Enhancement System

YelyenaYelyena
February 2015 edited February 2015 in Other Therapies & Instruments Flag
The Energy Enhancement SystemTM
1.Can anyone share experience with EES systems? Please.

2. Has anyone tried to measure a person before and after attending EES system
session?

I was told that it does not have magnetic field (0 gauss).

Below is some information from the SSE website http://eesystem.com/
what-is-ee-system/

You may not have heard of Scalar fields, but they are well known in
astrophysics, geology, and hydrodynamics.
A Scalar field is known as a fith-dimensional non-linear field. Scalar fields
exist out of relative time and space, thus they do not decay over time or
distance from their source. They are unbounded and capable of passing through
solid matter
The human body has crystalline structures in every cell wall that are capable
of holding a charge. When the human body enters a Scalar field the electro
magnetic field of the individual becomes excited. EESystem uses Scalar
technology to return the body to a more original and appropriate electrical
matrix.
The EESystem has been clinically proven to boost human cell regeneration,
immune fuctions, and neurotransmitter functions. It can help eliminate and
nullify effects of disruptive frequencies in the body while optimizing cellular
energy levels to 70-90 millivolts.
This means that EESystem can significantly increase your energy, mental.....

I understand that human body creates and works with scalar ways (biophoton
property) to transfer energy and information but I do not know what kind of
wave is created by EES system and what is result of "excitement" of a human
cell by not living thing might be. 

I am researching this because it may help with structural issues where the
Chiren cannot.

    Yelyena, I experience scalar wave treatments before light therapy. It's
    intense, but it was helpful. 
    I had 5 treatments. 5 days in a row. It was too much for me, lots of detox.
    But I think it could have been a way to go rather than the light. I had to
    choose one of the other. I chose the light.
    Hope that helps,
    Barbara

  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel

    With most of these systems the "improvements" consist generally of
    SUPPRESSION of symptoms. And what is called "detox" is often a severe
    stress response of the body. The "excitement" of cells also is not
    something that is suspect.

    One needs to investigate the workings and effects to see what it really
    does. The mention of improving immune functions is already very suspect.

    Please don't combine anything with the Chiren treatment. It should always
    be either/or. ESPECIALLY when another system causes a reaction, you don't
    want to combine it. 

    As long as improved function of the body can heal "structural" issues, the
    Chiren can help with this too. 
    You need to realize, however, that there are structural issues that the
    healthiest body cannot resolve anymore.
   
    What I mean with structural issues that the Chiren cannot heal, is what
    cannot be healed by even the healthiest body because the structural issue
    prevents it. 
    When an organ has been removed for example, no holistic method will be able
    to assist to grow it back, when bones are broken and not aligned restoring
    self-healing ability will not align them but only speed up healing, when
    there is a wound where borders don't touch this will also not heal, when
    bones have grown together they will not all of a sudden separate again etc.
   
    Barbara: If you used scalar therapy before the biophoton therapy, you must
    have noticed that still the Pituitary and Parathyroid dropped and needed to
    be corrected with Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus in your first session. No
    matter what people claim that has helped them in the past, I have never
    seen any system that corrected this imbalance caused by these vaccinations.
    Without the Pituitary being balanced the self-healing system never
    functions optimally. This alone makes the claims about scalar therapy
    suspect to me.

    The main question is: HOW do you know that reactions are detox? What were
    those reactions? I have noticed that "detox" is usually another way of
    describing severe stress of the body. 

    In Biontology these severe reactions should not happen, that is when you
    treat the right way and respect the body.

    Thank you, Johan

    I agree with you on that EES system does not seem to "restore"  endocrinal
    system and other systems at all. I had client who have had EES session some
    time ago when she had broken ankle and had swelling below o  her foot every
    day for 15 years. After just one EES session the swelling went away and
    never came back. That was one "tangible" effect of EES system on the body
    after injury. I do not know how her body did that. I did not measure her
    before and after EES session at that time.

    With her we started to "clean" energy body by Biontology protocol and  it
    was the same process as with anybody who did undergo biontology sessions
    before. The endocrinal system (severely undermined), digestive system,
    reproductive system, etc. Regardless of her improvement after EES session I
    still did scar treatment on her right ankle and sure enough after this I
    could measure non existent before drops on Bladder, Kidney and Stomach
    meridians. It tells me that the scar tissue has not been corrected by EES
    session but why her swelling went away and never returned back (even after
    biontology sessions)? I would like to know that.

    I am curious about claims of other people whose  injuries seems to get
    better after EES sessions. But I never measured them before and after.

    Yes, it true. I was treated by an experienced practitioner and he measured
    the pituitary and parathyroid even after scalar waves. My pituitary is
    stable (unless in spin) my parathyroid mostly stable, and thyroid dropped.
    For months I, tried to find cause, work on the terrain, etc., to avoid
    taking thyroid, but decided to take a low dose when symptoms remained and
    blood tests indicated very low thyroid production.

    I've been able to gradually reduce levels of thyroid supplementation and
    still maintain normal thyroid blood levels and light measurement. But it's
    a slow process.

    With all due respect to all experienced practitioners who have treated me,
     I still haven't reached sustainable hormonal balance. I am however, able
    to help others do so. That is very rewarding to see.

Q&A - Tapwater, UVB, Life Blood...

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
December 2013 edited December 2013 in Q&A Flag
Questions:
1. Is it possible to treat 1 specific meridianpoint to stimulate or to
unstress, for example in case of pain? If so, how can it be done (e.g. with
just only the blue light?)

2. Can we neutralize our tapwater because of all the hormones and toxins in it?

3. Is it safe to use an UVB-light?

4. What do you think of the Live Blood Analysis combined with Biophoton
treatment?

    Answers:
    1. There are ways like we do with the treatment for shorter/longer leg
    (described elsewhere in this forum). This must however be done with the
    electrical system. BUT be ware that this would be symptom treatment and
    that you still need to treat the real cause. (With the difference in leg
    length this would be a Gallbladder issue).

    Pain is generally caused by meridians, So have a look on which meridian the
    pain is, then pay specific attention to this meridian. For example: Bladder
    /backache, Gallbladder/hip pain, Intestine/Shoulder pain.
   
    The Light Rods are not small enough to target specific points. In case of
    symptom treatment for pain you can put the light rods around the pain area,
    if you want to do this.
   
    2. In tap water the Toxins or Bacteria will always remain in the water,
    since they cannot get away. A lot of quality improvement can be obtained by
    just treating the water with the program 2-7 years. 

    3. The UVB light is reported to kill bacteria. If it really does, or what
    else is done to the water, is not known by me.

    4. The life blood analysis is very unreliable as diagnostic method. Often
    practitioners "see" things they interpreted the wrong way. 
    However, there are practitioners of dark field microscopy that are using it
    to detect changes that the biophoton treatment causes.
    In a general sense and for showing the client what Biontology does, the
    phenomenon of rouleau formation (clotting together of red blood cells)
    might be interesting since it tells something about the overall condition
    of the body. Research in Graz has shown that Chiren treatment immediately
    resolves the rouleaux in blood. 
    But you might ask yourself whether the client needs this kind of proof
    still when he/she feels better anyway.

    Regarding Answer #1: I understand that it would only be symptom treatment
    but helping someone get out of immediate pain may help them to relax while
    the standard treatment takes effect. I’ve done that with the glass rods
    locally, in an area of pain, many times and have found it particularly
    helpful with headaches and backaches.

    I can see how removing energy from a meridian with pain might be helpful.
    Would adding energy into a supporting meridian that is deficient, based on
    5-element theory, be appropriate? 

    I would like to know more about what instances you would opt to add energy
    vs remove energy from various meridians.
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    December 2013 edited December 2013 Flag
    That is exactly what I meant to say, sometimes it can be helpful to have an
    extra possibility for symptom treatment when the normal treatment doesn't
    reduce the pain enough. But usually when the underlying cause is addressed
    a reduction of pain is immediate.

    Remember to first treat causes (protocol!) and then if necessary do symptom
    treatment locally (without remedies). 

    Adding energy to a meridian always increases the pain. 

    All meridians are connected and points have specific meanings and
    influences. Since you can't measure the effect of what you are doing and
    you don't have a full understanding of acupuncture I am strongly advising
    against what you are suggesting. It is not Biontology, which has at its
    core asking and listening to the client to prevent assumptions and causing
    further imbalance.

    Please don't get distracted too much. Some local treatment with the light
    Rods will be sufficient to reduce pain.

Chikey in the Fridge

I found out that there's too much Dioxin in the Food where I live (Spain) and
am trying to find solutions all day.
Treating with Dioxin in the Chiren, sure does work. But since we're a big

    You want to place a Chikey in the fridge?
    This is a new idea of which I have no idea how and where you want to work
    this. I do not think Chikey or anything else for this matter will have any
    influence on the fridge. But perhaps I misunderstand you completely.

    The best way is to treat all products individually, or alternatively to put
    for example all vegetables in a bowl of water and treat the water. Water is
    a great conductor and it will influence all products that are in the water.

    Otherwise put the products between the footplates or stick the ends of the
    fiber optic cables into the food or drinks.

    1. Rods and Cables won't be damaged by liquid.
    2. Water communicates very fast and in theory very, very large amounts of
    water can be treated by just one Chikey/Chiren...  more than you'll ever
    put in container. 
    You could also treat a swimming pool... the maximum has never been tested
    though...
    3. When treating Food/Water, you should use the Standard 2-7 Years Program
    on your Chiren, or Program 2 on your Chikey.

    It is more an understanding about how the Information is transmitted most
    effectively with the Chiren. So it is about the technology... and there are
    things that work and don't work. Johan is the inventor.... isn't he? He has
    done many tests over the last 30 years. So if he is not completely
    convinced about it.... 

    Why Johan says this is most likely not going to work, has the same reason
    as to why homeopathic pellets, when brought into the Chiren, don't have the
    same effect as dilutes/liquids have. Although you can test the Information
    of the pellets when brought into the Chiren, when you treat with them they
    are not potent at all..... 
    Water seems a necessary medium to transport the Light and Information of
    the Chiren most effectively!

    To get more understanding, I would suggest you go and read other comments
    about this on the forum. Sometimes what you measure is not what you get....

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    May 2013 edited May 2013 Flag
    That is true....results are real and this is what you have to look at....
    and within the field of intention everything can be created. When you
    consequently get similar results you know you have found something that
    really works.

    Photo's do work, the energy in them is strongly connected to the person or
    animal. Many practitioners and I too have treated photo's with great
    results, but then names with birth dates have less effect... Also there's
    hardly any distance between photo and the plates, so no medium is really
    necessary.

    Unfortunately we also have to look at the reality of working with the
    Chiren, and not everything works the same. We actually have a recent
    experience with a program that was created for Chikey cards and the
    Information, although it should have been properly transmitted, just wasn't
    and this was visible in the results with the cards....
    So in the Chiren it is not only all intention. There is technology that
    follows certain rules, that we still not know all about...

    I do hope it works! But we'll just have to experiment with it some time
    before making definite conclusions. Measuring alone is not enough proof...
    if we would agree with this right away and then find out it doesn't work

    molecules in the water are restructured in a certain way that attractive
    forces between molecules become stronger (cohesion?) . Therefore, the
    Chikey treatment of water affects hydrogen bonds in the water? 

    2. Does it mean that treated water increases ability to hydrate a body and
    therefore a body might be hydrated with lesser amount of (treated) water? 

    3. Does it mean that drinking treated water might intensify cellular
    processes?

    I too have noticed that treating water and other liquids makes them more
    “full bodied” and improves their taste.

    However, my understanding is that liquids with high surface tension have
    lower absorption ability. This is why surfactants are added to laundry
    detergent.

    I’m wondering if there is a way to know if the Chikey treated water is
    better absorbed by cells regardless of the increase in surface tension?  If
    that is the case, I’m hoping that Johan, with his knowledge in physics, can
    explain the paradox.

    Yes, Renate, you are correct on that. To lower the surface tension one has
    to add laundry detergent or just wash clothes with hot water because the
    surface tension is greater when water is colder.
    If people can be hydrated better with treated water ( and I do not know
    this yet) which seems to be contradiction but since the water is such a
    great mystery it would be good to know how the water really works in a
    body.
    When water "records" information it acquires new properties. The structure
    of water is much more important then chemical composition.When structure of
    water changes the water molecules are organized in so called "clusters",
    those clusters behave as memory cells. Within of each of water memory cells
    there 440.000 information panels each of which is responsible for certain
    type of interaction with environment.
    Since we do not put any remedies during water treatment process but still
    can sense the change something is at work.
    One person who has been drinking treated with Chiren water noted to me that
    her craving for sweets has diminished and she is not in any way food
    "junkie".
    What do we DO when we treat water with Chiren with program 2 to 7?

    I wish that I knew exactly what happens to the water but I don't.

    What I do know:

    1. The surface of the water molecules changes and becomes a lot bigger
    making more space for absorption.
    This could apply both to toxins and to information. I believe water changes
    properties once the angle between the hydrogen atoms changes in the water
    molecule.

    2. High frequencies reflect on water while lower ones penetrate the water
    => coherent waves reflect on the water surface (creating a straight line)
    and chaotic waves penetrate the water (creating a hyperbole = curved line)

    3. Biophoton treatment => chaotic waves are inverted => less and less
    chaotic waves penetrate the water molecule => my theory is that this
    relaxes the water and as a consequence relaxes us. 
   
    4. Changing the surface of the oxygen atom will automatically change the
    angle of the hydrogen atoms that connect to that surface.
   
    5. Change of angle => change of properties.
    The angles of the pyramid's sides are also crucial in obtaining effects,
    the angles between planets are very important in astrology. Everything
    simply depends on angles.

    6. I needed exactly the same settings of the Chiren to make an effect on
    cement and to get a perfect biophoton emission on milk. The only thing
    cement and milk have in common is water...
    So I believe that both the Chiren and the ChiKey work on the water in our
    bodies and in all living systems.
     
    Light and Water are the soul and the reflection of the soul.

    Just to clarify: 
    The experiments that were done on water after treatment with biophoton
    instruments showed an increase in surface. So not an increase in surface
    tension.

    I definitely feel the difference in the taste of water after I treat the
    water. It's very obvious to me.

    Once a guest who visited my house asked me the brand of the water after
    drinking it even though I did not tell anything about water treatment.

    Candace: There was never a follow up on this discussion, and thus it
    remained in the realm of ideas.

    If you want to research this you first need a known source of contaminated
    food that you put in the fridge. Then you treat it and then you can test if
    it still affects you...

    Hi Sandra,

    Diane has been working on a new Chikey instruction manual, so it is on his
    way...

    In the mean time I'll try to answer your questions:

    1. In the Chikey the sockets that are used for the Fiber Optic Cables
    (light cables) are also compatible with the Scar Cables (orange and blue
    electrical cables). 
    So for Scar Treatment use the two outer sockets.....

    2. The split-end cable is the "measuring" cable that is used for the
    Biofeedback function of the Chikey. The two end caps can be connected to
    electrical pad that should be connected to the body and should be used with
    conductive gel.

    3. Although the color of the two pad connectors are adjusted to the
    Biofeedback Measurement Cable, they can also be used on the Scar Cables. 

    4. Yes, you have understood that correctly

    5. This is about the Biofeedback measurement, which measures overall Stress
    Level. The Measurement Cable (split end) connects with the black socket.

    6. We have a 9 hour time difference with the Netherlands in Walnut
    Creek.... 
    The Office opening hours are 9am to 5pm... which would be 18.00 - 02.00
    Dutch time.

    Thanks for answering the questions.
    it is just not clear to me the biofeedback option, i understand how to put
    the cable, but what and how exactly does it measure ? what program ? how to
    read this ? the electrical pads, are the pads, that i use for scar therapy
    ??

    Biofeedback function:

    - Works simultaneous with the programs that you are running, so you can see
    your reaction during treatment.

    - The pads are the ECG pads, which you can also use for Scar Treatment. In
    order to get a proper Biofeedback reading you need to use them with extra
    Conductive Gel (even if they are pre-gelled).

    - The reading you can observe in the screen as Vertical Stripes, that are
    further apart when more relaxed and closer together when more stressed...

    - What day and time have you tried to reach the office in Walnut Creek?

    Question: 
    1. Am I right in my understanding that the Biofeedback Graphs on Chikey and
    Chiren read differently?
   
    Comment above states more Stress => Vertical Stripes on Chikey closer to
    each other. 
    Optimal Stresslevel in the Chiren => Graph (comprised of vertical stripes)
    stays in the middle zone.

    2. With several of my clients the Biofeedback Graph of the Chiren never
    reached the middle
    What does this mean? A lack of energy?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    May 2013 edited May 2013 Flag

    The Stress Graphs on the Chikey and on the Chiren are indeed different.

    Chiren: the size of the Graphs 

    Chikey: the togetherness of the Graphs

    If the Graphs do not reach the middle, it is probably due to conductivity.
    More gel might help.

    Does the same amount of light come through the thin cables used with the
    Chikey as with the 2 mm cables used with the Chiren?

    For those that prefer the softer 2mm Chiren cables:  Is it possible to get
    different adapters that will connect them to the Chikey?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    May 2013 edited May 2013 Flag
    The cup cable of the Chiren is the same as the cables used for the Chikey,
    and this cable fits into the ports that are used for the soft fibre optic
    cables too. So they all have the same plug/end ==> the adapters should fit
    on the soft cables too.

    I think this will be more a matter of convenience that a matter of
    improving effectiveness... As far as I had the chance to observe, the
    Chikey is as effective as the Chiren with regard to the light treatment...

    I Chikeyd the whole Kidney meridian of a friend two days ago (Whiplash
    treatment) with great effect on her Symptoms. Of course this would be
    similar to acupuncture and just unblocks the energy for a while without
    addressing the deeper cause.... but I didn't have a Chiren with me...

    Hi Karolina,
    I would like to use my 2mm Chiren cables because they coil up nicely and
    don't take up as much real estate as the thinner wire cables that tend to
    have a mind of their own.

    I've tried attaching the Chikey adapters to the 2mm soft Chiren cables but
    the adapters are just a hair too small.  I pushed really hard, to the point
    of forcing, and was only able to get the adapter part way onto the soft
    cable.  Then it got stuck half way on and and it took a lot of doing to get
    it off.  I've tried it three times just to be sure that I had it aligned
    properly.  It seems that my 2 mm soft cables are just a fraction larger
    than the adapter. 

    Are you able to connect your Chiren 2mm soft cables to the Chikey adapters?

    The wires are "same size", since they are made for the same sockets.
    However I understand what you mean. I have tried the adapters and they do
    fit well enough to work I think (you can check this by putting the wire in
    the port with blue light and see if it comes through), but they are a bit
    tight...

    Several of us have noticed less blue light coming out of the Chikey. I’m
    posting Karolina’s explanation to me so that other therapists may benefit
    from the information:

    “There's no connection between the amount of blue (led-light) and the
    amount of biophotons (invisible) that shines through the cables. The output
    of blue light has nothing to do with the effectiveness of the Chiren or
    Chikey. The blue light is only an indication of what is the output side of
    the Chiren/Chikey and because the Chikey is battery operated it has a
    slightly weaker output of led-light. The bio-photons are not induced by the
    instruments themselves (no electricity involved), so no difference
    there.....”

    I found this helpful as I had no idea that both instruments emit LED light
    in addition to biophoton light.

    The best way to explain it must be that the chip card holds information to
    the filters and amplifier in the chikey who then transform the info to
    light. You can use the television or internet metaphor. Programs are
    translated to info send by light cables to the receiver(TV)

    I believe you can make cards with the Starlight, but you must have the
    cards for chikey to do it.

    You can make cards for the Chiren with the StarLight the same way you would
    load information (a remedy) into salted water/alcohol. 
    However, the cards have to be named in order to be received by the ChiKey. 
    And this naming is only possible with the Chiren.

    A healthy immune system is capable of dealing with all infections.

    We can never say that Biontology can "cure" a specific disease, since this
    is not what is done. The "only" thing that Biontology does is balance the
    body in a way that the immune system starts functioning properly again and
    this usually results in recovery from infectious disease.

    Depending on the response of you client to the Biontology treatment the
    answer to you question is: 
    Yes, it is possible to help a client with this infection, but there is no
    guarantee.

Too Much Potassium - Is This Possible?

liselottewliselottew
February 2013 edited February 2014 in General Questions Flag
Client:
Girl 20 years, 

Diet:
Most ecological Green food 
Some times Meat. 
Only little Salt
Lots of Broccoli, Squash, Avocado, Beans and other Potassium rich food. 

Symptoms:
Joint Pain and Knee Problem/Pain => since 5 years old. 
Urinary tract inflammation => recently => used Penicillin
Tired all the time
Potatoes => cause aggravation of her symptoms

Session:
Suppression => Galbladder Remedies were needed for drops to show

Measurement: 
Circulatory system: Ani-Tetanus and Serum Ovile,   
Nervous System: Mercury,
Large Intestines: Chronic Appendicitis, Chronic Tonsillitis, Tonsillitis,
Appendicitis, 
Adrenal Glands: Penicillinum 
Bladder: Brucellosis   

Research:
When Adrenals did not drop anymore => measuring with Natrium Homaccord (Sodium)
created a drop, Selenium did not create a drop

Question:
1. Is it right to conclude that the body doesn't want more Salt, but needs more
Potassium right? 
2. I am wondering if I can give her the advise to eat more potassium because of
the pain in joints and body. 
3. Potato is one of the biggest sources of Potassium, can she maybe get too
much of it?

I won't measure her in a while now because she doesn't live near me, so I cant
report at once. But I'm very interested to know more about these potassium
questions.

    * If she would react on the potassium in the potato, she would react in a
    similar way on all potassium rich foods. And since she's eating a lot of
    that I don't believe it is the potassium that she's reacting to.

    * Vegetables of the Nightshade family (tomatoes, potatoes, peppers) are
    actually known to cause joint pain and inflammatory reactions in people who
    are sensitive to it. You should try to work on the underlying cause of the
    food sensitivity/allergy though and this is most likely the compromised
    digestive system (Chronic Appendicitis!).
    Interesting that you find both Anti-Tetanus and Serum Ovile on the
    Circulation. They are both indicated for allergic reactions (and are by the
    way not commonly measured on Circulation…)  
    => see Heel Site for remedy indications

    * Penicillinum on the Adrenal Glands is very strange (Johan's comment). Why
    are you even looking for this remedy on the Adrenals?

    * The Natrium Homaccord in the Chiren is high potency, which would mean
    that it's effect (and measurement) would work opposite from Sodium
    (Natrium) in the body. Of course the opposite information of Sodium is not
    good for the Adrenals since they need both Potassium and Sodium.

    Belladonna is a great remedy to take because it also comes from the
    nightshade family. 
    This is how homeopathy works. Cure like with like.

    Belladonna in the Chiren is high potency and will have the opposite effect
    in the body as the original plant would have. The effect is inverted from
    potency D9 (9X) and up.

    Ok great to get that straightend out! Yes I will when I see her again. 

    But can you get to much potassium? And do we need to add salt to our food,
    how much if that's the case? How does one know if one is eating the right
    amount?

    Where would I look for Penecillinum then, except the liver? I thought that
    it could take energy from both Kidney and Adrenal Gland, since it s to big
    molecule for kidneys to handle. But then I wont anymore,

    I would ask myself: how does that symptom match with what drops you
    measure? 
    In this case I would keep my focus on the App and Tonso (all degrees
    checked?)
    A part of that treatment would be to measure on Intestine Flora too. 
    Intestine Flora (bact. coli, bact. pyo, bact, proteus, bact, lactis)  it is
    indeed needed in balance, and some of them;  can cause a Bladder
    inflammation that she had before. Two symptoms with one cause , so you can
    work after the principle: minimum number of nosodes with the maximum
    effect. Lack of intestine flora makes people tired also.
    You measured different elements: and I wonder: did you only measure
    Penicillin on the Adrenal Glands? did they (Adrenal Glands)  not correct
    with the Chron App and Chron Tonso? 
    The body needs balance on Natrium (Na+) and Kalium (K+) in its
    energyprocesses.. So Why would the Adrenals have a drop if it did not
    correct with Chron App and Chron Tonso? Did you check on Berberis and
    Selenium for potassium unbalance?
    Also Penicillin can cause drops on the Adrenal Glands but also correct more
    of the other drops as well, IF it is a cause. 
    Too much Potassium? you ask: well the question is if she ever kan eat
    herself into that situation if she is eating normal. The opposite though is
    more common, a lack of Potassium.
    Everyone needs a balance of Natrium/ sodium and Kalium/ potassium. it is
    part of good health.  
    We are what we eat so a focus on nutrition is healthy and as a
    bionotologist we talk to people who might not be as aware as we are of the
    dangers in food industry. I am not an expert on nutrition  - I leave that
    to others and focus on Chiren to have results but to encourage potassium
    food I do if neeed but never instead of treatments.

    I have measured on all the different forms of Appendicitis => Appendicitis

    Should I give/measure on Intestinal Flora when the Large Intestines are not
    healed? 

    She matched on Chronic Appendicitis. I remember Johan saying to wait with
    correcting the Intestinal Flora until the Appendicitis doesn't show
    anymore...

    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    February 2013 edited February 2014 Flag
    Regarding Appendicitis and Intestinal Flora:
    Yes, to use the Intestinal Bacteria for rebuilding the Gut Flora you need
    to wait until the environment of the Intestines is welcoming again for them
    to live there (Appendicitis gone…).
    However the Bacteria can be necessary to correct infections they cause
    elsewhere in the body because of the Dysbiosis in the gut. 
    So you could for example measure Bact. Proteus on the Bladder while there's
    Chronic Appendicitis in the Intestines.

    Regarding too much Potassium:
    It is possible to get too much Potassium in your system especially in
    certain conditions. The balance of Sodium and Potassium is regulated by
    your Kidneys (and Adrenals) and if there's an issue with them it can cause
    high Potassium levels in the blood. Symptoms are muscle weakness and heart
    problems like slow heart beat and arrhythmia.

    Overeating Sodium/Potassium
    Both overeating on Sodium and Potassium wouldn't cause immediate problems
    if all organs function properly. The balance in the Cells, Tissues and
    Blood are regulated well by the body. 

    In the long run it might cause problems, but I can only imagine Potassium
    intake to become a problem if it is taken in a concentrated form like pills
    or salt. Potassium rich food always have some Sodium in it too and if you
    get both elements into your body like this I don't think you can cause a
    real problem. 
    Only if there's a disease that interferes with regulation you can
    overdose... but then of course this Cause needs to be addressed in your
    treatment.

    I've never needed (measured) Penicillinum on the Adrenals. There are other
    things to look for first. 

    The problem is more the destruction of the Intestinal Flora than the
    substance itself in my experience that needs to be addressed. If the body
    starts detoxing, also toxins that you don't treat are going to be expelled.

    Measuring Penicillinum anywhere on the Hormonal System is very unlikely.
    And even if this was the case, Penicillinum only matching the Adrenal
    glands is impossible. It must match elsewhere too. 
   
    It must match the Bladder or Kidneys too, that is if it had an effect on
    the infection there, because Penicillin suppresses infections. And the
    infections will still be there underneath, this causes imbalance in the
    Kidney or Bladder meridian. 
   
    The side effect of Penicillin is that it destroys the Intestinal Flora and
    this far more important to consider and to work on then the toxin itself.
    If the basic function of the body and organs is healthy, then toxins are
    going to be expelled automatically. Focussing on toxins is a distraction.  

    Once the Intestinal points are asking for the Intestinal Flora, the
    suppression (of the Penicillin) is not there anymore on the Intestines and
    for this to happen the Appendicitis has to be gone too. The body asking for
    Intestinal Flora is only going to happen when the whole Appendicitis
    condition is gone. So using the Intestinal Bacteria Remedies to correct the
    Intestinal Flora is not going to work before the climate in the Intestines
    is welcoming them. 

    The Intestinal Bacteria can however be measured as a Nosode (counteracting
    the disease causing effect) on organs where the Intestinal Bacteria don't
    belong, but migrate to because of the bad climate in the Intestines. For
    example the Bladder in this case.

    It is far more likely that Penicillin measures on the Bladder instead of
    the Adrenals... I don't see any reason for suspecting Penicillin to match
    on the Adrenal glands, because the interaction between Adrenal Glands and
    Kidney/Bladder/Large Intestines is that the Adrenals influence those organs
    and not the other way around. And the effect of Penicillin is in the
    Bladder, Kidney and Large Intestines..... 

    Physiologically there's no apparent root for Penicillin to move to the
    Adrenal Glands or to influence them.

    Conclusion: 
    Don't try to build the Intestinal Flora, when there's still Appendicitis. 
    Look for Nosodes of diseases/bacteria first before you try toxins.  
    Don't focus too much on toxins, focus on the terrain (overall condition of
    the organs).
    Penicillinum is hardly ever needed as a remedy.

    There is however a problem with the pages where biophoton highways on body
    and finger/toe are combined. They were supposed to be copies of the
    complete hand and feet maps that I created myself, but with some of them
    there has been made a mistake. They were added last minute due to time
    pressure and were not checked. I am sorry, it was my assumption that if the
    original was OK, the copying would have been done without mistakes too…

    The Nervous System biophoton highway is on the wrong finger
    The Veins are missing
    The order of photon highways is a little confusing.

    These pages in essence are an additional illustration that you can also do
    without. So personally I would take them out if they are too confusing.
    I will try to find someone who can redo the pictures. I would also like to
    see the hands with the fingers down instead of upward….

Just to be sure to get all misunderstandings out of the way....

Question:
Can we "trust" this book, at least the English pages? The remedy part is OK,
but can we trust the rest?

I understand that things might change and that misunderstandings happen all the
time, but I can't understand why on the English pages the Footplate/Dyslexia
thing was written without Johan knowing this.

    Norwegian is not Johan's language, so I figure someone else has written it.
    Probably both the Norwegian and the English part. I have no insight
    whatsoever about what has been taught in Norway, unfortunately that was
    before I joined the party :O). And of course I don't read Norwegian
    either...
   
    Johan always had a lot on his plate, with running the whole business. Until
    now he didn't find the right support in lightening his burden..... and
    sometimes he has been a little bit too "trusting"... So I think he only
    glanced over the book and didn't thoroughly read it. 
   
    A possible story of what might have gone wrong, considering what I have
    observed:
   
    Johan says/writes one thing without enough explanation and emphasis on the
    most important facts => assumptions are made by the listener/reader => this
    becomes a "knowing", or in other words, there are no questions asked
    anymore about it.... => It was integrated in courses and manual => Johan
    trusted that he had communicated the right information already, so he
    thought it should be right and because of this reading was not necessary
    anymore (no time anyway)...
   
    Anyway... now there is assistance and he has a bit more time for details.
    And when I hear/read something that is not clear to me, I ask, ask and ask
    until I know for sure what Johan really means and why. And then on the
    forum I share all these things I thoroughly picked Johan's brain for.... ;
    -) So the most reliable information is actually here on the forum. The
    books for the most part are still valid, but there are definitely mistakes
    in them too.... I would suggest to use the forum as the main teaching tool
    in combination with your remedy pages.

Allopathic Medicine in Biontology

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
January 2013 edited January 2014 in Medication Flag
There are some misconceptions about whether allopathic medicines have to be
stopped when people are treated with StarLight or with Chiren.
In principle no allopathic medicine needs to be stopped. In general the
biophoton sessions work anyway, although it might take more sessions than
normally.

There are only a few categories of medical drugs that seem to inhibit results.
The main one is acid inhibitors. These are drugs that stop the production of
stomach acid. Antacids (e.g. Alka-Seltzer or Pepto-Bismol) only neutralize the
acid and will not significantly interfere with the treatment.
Another problematic category is steroids. When people are taking these, the
results will be delayed and sometimes blocked. It is advised to just treat
through the steroids but explain to the client that it is to be expected that 3
times more treatments are needed.

The most important question that you have to ask your client is : does the drug
work? Or do the drugs work? If they have the desired effect, then there is no
reason to stop the drug. If the drug does not work, then the client could
choose to try to reduce the intake of the drug or to stop it completely. This
is a very individual thing.

Overall, i only tell people to stop once the problems for which they take the
drug have been resolved.
Like anti-depressiva. They can keep taking the drug, until they get high on the
drug. Then it is not necessary anymore.

Only certain medications that are not helping clients with any of their
experienced symptoms or are prescribed as preventative like anti-cholesterol
drugs are advised to stop after the first treatment.

There are also cases where the drugs that people take are actually the cause of
the problems. But overall i can say: first get the problems away, then ask the
people to try to reduce their medication. But always ask the patients
beforehand if they have the courage to do this. It has happened more than once
that when the time comes to reduce the drug, they do not dare.

    When I was treated with the Chrien I took 20mg of omeprazol for reflux and
    esophageal hernia. After my 3. treatment i started to reduce the intake,
    and did not take any after treatment 4. I was treated for astma manly.
    Great succes and now I practice on my own :-)

    Thank you very much for clarifying this because there  has been much
    confusion about it,  and confusion in thinking about it ....  as most
    antibiotics and medications cause suppression and we are creating
    "expression" of dis-ease. So, it seems like we are doing the opposite,
    which is why you say it must take longer if they continue to stay on.
     
    It does seem like when many clients hear this explanation, or hear the
    question you highly suggest to ask..."is it working?" (their medication)
    and the answer is no, (which is why ther are here) they will willingly
    taper down or stop.

    I also stopped taking everything while I was being treated with biophoton
    for my very serious illness and still take nothing and the freedom from
    that is wonderful!

Blood Transfusions

Ellen Sauer Draeger
December 2014 edited December 2014 in Client Safety Flag
Potential client:
Man who came from Peru to the US for treatment options. Because they aren't
able to get the drug of choice to him in Peru, they are waiting on different
drug options at this time.
He realizes that it isn't a treatment option, but that the Chiren will balance
his system and is very willing to have sessions if appropriate. 

Diagnosis:
Leukemia (7 month ago)

Medical Treatment/Drugs:
Blood transfusion (3 months ago)
Has not had any radiation, chemo, or drugs 

I was planning on doing only the Spin Inversion and Whiplash treatments for
him. Considering that he isn't receiving any treatment at this time, I felt
that this may be a perfect window of opportunity for him to have some sessions
so that the body can balance without the interference of other treatment
options at this time. 

Questions:
1. Due to the fact that clients with Leukemia usually have an inverted electron
spin, I was wondering if I could at least work on the Spin and Whiplash even
though he had a blood transfusion 3 months ago. I realize that the blood will
replenish itself within 3 months. 
2. Please advise on how to approach the sessions as well if you find it
appropriate. If not appropriate, please let me know the reasoning behind it.
3. At what point does the Chiren sessions outweigh any detriment that may come
from the blood transfusion, and how long should I wait to start to treat him? 
Please let me know when you think that I could safely start to run regular
sessions on him, and if I could start right away with the few supports above,
as time is of the essence with this case.
4. I realize that the Pituitary being the discernment center is an issue. Could
I even run Ozalite, Tonico, Fringed Violet, Selenium, Berberis, Causticum,
Space and Electroessence on the rods on a 2-7 as a treatment option to help
make it last longer while helping him to look for the cause of the Spin
Inversion? 

I would like to try to help him as soon as possible if I am able, as he may be
traveling elsewhere to find other treatment options by Jan. 12th and if I could
work on his spin, or possibly give him some sessions before he leaves, I feel
that it would be in his best interest to balance what can be done before he
goes elsewhere.

    Welcome to the forum Ellen. 

    In order to make your post easier to read for everyone, but mostly for
    Johan who needs to answer it, I have put your text in the format that is
    used for posting cases on this forum. The questions will be answered by
    Johan the coming week.

    Answers:
    1. You can certainly do Spin-Inversion treatments. In fact, you can treat
    all organ systems but the important thing is that you do not treat/balance
    the Pituitary.
    2. Just follow the protocols as given in your manual. Leukemia is normally
    a Liver/Gallbladder issue, but wait with the Liver until it is the right
    moment (the Liver is the deepest layer). In the mean time the Liver will
    improve anyway
    3. I think you can start regular sessions on him immediately, just do not
    treat the Pituitary gland for another 2 months or so. But everything else
    you can safely treat.
    4. There is no need to restrict yourself to support remedies. 
    5. You need to be aware of possible Spin-Inversion every time, and when it
    keeps showing up pay a lot of attention to finding and eliminating the
    cause.

    Feedback:
    Thank-you for your advice Johan!
    I'd like to share a recent experience with treating someone who had a blood
    transfusion.

    Client:
    Man, who had been treated 10 times before and had frequent Spin Inversions.
    He quit before he was 'balanced' because he wanted to prioritize other
    things.

    Work Environment:
    Works in a San Francisco news room => a high EMF environment.
    He is not going to work anymore right now.

    Diagnosis Now:
    Kidney cancer with spread to bone. His doctor says he has 18 months to
    live. 

    Recent Medical Treatments:
    Blood transfusion => after his surgery to remove the bone tumor (kidney
    metastasis) from his spine.

    Biophoton Sessions:
    He is easier to treat now because he is able to stay out of Spin Inversion
    between sessions (he is not in his high EMF work environment anymore)
    I did also not rush to treat the Pituitary.
    His biophotons are now intermittently balanced or he has only a few drops.
    He has done well in terms of no problems with rejecting the blood
    transfusion after biophoton therapy.

    If he chooses to return to the high EMF newsroom he will again struggle
    with frequent Spin Inversion and probably relapse. 

    Questions:
    1. Do you think it is now possible for this client to have long term (> 5
    year) survival if he can stay out of Spin Inversion even though the cancer
    has spread to his bones? 
    2. Do you think the doctor may be right about his survival chances?

    These questions were overlooked. I am sorry.

    Because others may have similar questions, I will not leave this post
    without answers although it may not be very useful anymore for Toril.

    Answers:
    As with anybody it is essential that he stays out of Spin Inversion.The
    doctor's prognosis might be right if he stays in the present conditions.
    I would treat him normally. But there is an absolute need to find the cause
    of the cancer.

Tetanus Vaccine Living on a Horse Farm

DennisOwensDennisOwens
March 2014 edited March 2014 in Medication Flag
Client lives in a place with horses, and lots of old wood, old nails and is
worried about Tetanus
Two boys, ages 7 & 9 were never vaccinated.

Question:
1. Would it be advisable to get a Tetanus vaccine for her boys and then reverse
it with Anti-Tetanus Nosode or wait until something happens then treat with
Anti-Tetanus or Pertussis

2. Or will treating with Anti-Tetanus act as a preventative?

    Answers:
    1. The (Anti-)Tetanus Vaccination is the cause of many illnesses. When
    someone is vaccinated an then treated, functional damage can be corrected
    but it will not be the same as someone who is not vaccinated. 
    My personal choice would be not to vaccinate, but I believe in natural
    selection. 
    There is absolutely no guarantee that someone living on a farm would be
    infected at some point, and even if there's infection this doesn't
    automatically lead to Tetanus. A healthy immune system will overcome most
    diseases.
    So I can't advise the parents. I can only share my point of view.

    2. treating with the Anti-Tetanus nosode does not act as a preventative

    Important: Security does not exist, you only can be secure within yourself.
    People often make destructive choices because they want to be safe and
    prevent all disaster from happening. By doing so they create more problems
    then they would have encountered in their lives if they would just have
    trusted life. 
    Accepting that death and disease are part of life is very healthy.
    Health is not a condition, it is a process and disease is part of it.

    Questions:
     1. So if someone does contract Tetanus, can it be treated with Biophoton
        Therapy?
     2. If so, which nosodes would be used and on which meridians would it be
        measured?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    March 2014 Flag
    Answers:
    1. I have no experience in treating Tetanus, but based on the symptoms it
    can be treated with our system.

    2. I would primarily focus on the Gallbladder and Stomach meridians and
    remedies. I have no idea what nosodes one would find, so I cannot advise
    you on this. But in the Support I would first choose Atropinum, Cuprum,
    Anacardium.

Home Assessment - Dielectric Unions

Candace Hsiao Young
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Spin Inversion & Cause Flag
Reason for this post:
EMR and magnetic field exposure assessment of my home=> Performed last year by
 a building biologist 

Results of assessment:
Strong magnetic field in a corner of my house affected by a water line acting
as a partial neutral current path. 
588 milliamps on the water service supply pipe where it enters the home. 
987 milliamps were measured on the ground wire running from the electrical
service panel to the water service supply pipe. 

Recommendation:
Install a dielectric union to resolve this issue.

Question:
Problem is plumbers in my area are reluctant to install a dielectric union to
resolve this issue as they do not understand how this is related to magnetic
fields. Is this something anyone in this forum has heard of and can confirm is
valid?

    This may be the same problem that I had, and luckily had an electrician who
    was willing to explain to the plumbers what was needed.  There was
    electrical current coming in on my waterline from other nearby housed.
     What they did was splice a 3 foot length of plastic pipe into the water
    line.  Don't know if this is the same issue you are talking about.  It's
    quit frustrating finding any contractors who understand this issue, but
    some of them are interested and willing to learn.

    The building biologist did send detailed instructions and offered to
    discuss this with contractors. Problem is not enough electricians and
    plumbers understand the disturbing effect of magnetic fields on people, or
    that they may be caused by water lines acting as partial or full neutral
    paths. They were trained by their teachers and unions to only address very
    specific technical issues.

    I am currently in contact with a plumber who can install a dielectric
    union, and will do it for his price, but who also doesn't understand how
    this may correct a disturbing magnetic field. Along these lines, many
    Americans still do not believe EMR causes health effects.

    She can eat only small amount of foods at one time. 

    What would be your suggestions on how to address this problem. Is it result
    of liver dysfuction (which did not show so far)? Digestive issue (with
    Gallbladder) or anything else. Any tips?

    Hi Yelyena,

    See the comment of Johan about stomach acid medication.

    The symptoms you describe are both Liver and Gallbladder issues.

    First the excretion channels have to be addressed. So focus on Intestines,
    Kidneys and Gallbladder. It is very likely that after this the Liver stress
    is lessened and it starts showing drops in one of the next treatments. 

    When the Liver shows itself you can start treating it.

    Thank you, Karolina
    Today we had another session and she said she did not take anti-acid
    medication. The picture became clearer.

    Liver - Appendicitis
    Gallbladder - Billary Cirrhosis;
    Stomach - Den Kombi, Anacardium;
    Large Intestines - Diverticulitis, Podophylum.
    Bladder - Myom Uteri .

    She is taking high blood pressure meds every day (High blood pressure comes
    and goes - GB issue)
    She is also taking statins.
    Interesting that she said that she never took any vaccinations but her TW
    showed Polio and Mumps in previous session. Is that possible?

    February 2013 edited February 2013 Flag
    Hi Yelyena,

    From your last treatment I would like to comment:

    Did you check all three Appendicitis remedies? ( Acute, Chronic and
    Necrotic?)
    Did the Appendicitis correct more drops? This could explain the
    Gallbladder, Stomach and Large intestine drops as well. 
    The Tonsils might also be inflamed as the Appendix and Tonsils have the
    same type of tissue so check next time.

    An Appendicitis situation would inflict on the whole balance in the body,
    creating stress and a very unhealthy environment in the whole digestive
    system, which the Gallbladder is part of (excretion of bile, created by the
    Liver, to digest fat).  
    An inflamed or degenerating appendix can cause infections/inflammations/
    irritations in multiple other organs so watch out for this when you measure
    next time. 
     

    You can check the Gallbladder to find out why it is matching on Billiary
    Cirrhosis. You can test on the Samonella's, Appendicitis (any of the 3
    degrees), Calculi Biliaris (Stones), Campylobactor pylori. The last one can
    give Stomach Ulcers and inflamation. 

    If Gastritis matches on stomach drops, it would indicate if she has too
    little acid which would give the same symptoms as too much acid, That is
    the most common mistakte for people with acid problems, they think they
    have to much acid, and take medicine for that, but in fact the body is
    lacking and therefore the medicin is a huge problem in giving signals to
    reduce production instead of rising production of acid.

    Westen Medicine talk about stress as the cause for Acid problems. And to
    make that more specific we say it is the Gallbladder and its emotional
    component Willpower that is out of balance that causes the stressful life
    that is very common these days. People do more than they have energy for
    and forget to rest and restore energy levels after intense times.
    Listening to logic and head is more common now than listening to the body
    and not overdoing it and resting when the body gives signs.
    Sleep and rest is still an underestimated friend to heal, and with the
    Chiren it becomes clear when the Gallbladder and the Adrenal Glands show
    themselves with imbalances. 
    I must say that to sleep away from a chronic condition, might not be
    possible but if people would rest before it went as far, it would help. 

    The Gallbladder is certainly playing a role here, and I would test her on
    Selenium and Berberis for the Adrenal Glands to see if the nervous energy
    from the Gallbladder leading to acid problems is caused by stress She has
    no normal energy but still keeps going.... 

    The Gallbladder causes all kinds of cramping and can also cause the blood
    wessels to cramp, leaving less space for the blood and thereby the
    Gallbladder causes the symptom of high blood pressure...

    High blood pressure can also be caused by her Circulation that has too much
    fluid in the blood and then you have to look at the Kidneys AND the Adrenal
    Glands for the Sodium-Potassium balance. If there is insufficient energy
    from the Adrenal Glands check if Selenium and/or Berberis match her drops
    indicating that the normal energy level of the body is low, and
    automatically we run on willpower = Gallbladder energy, the reserve tank so
    to speak. 

    Did she know about the fibroid tumors (Myom Uteri)? 
    Did she have any experience with these or cysts before? 

    A cyst forms because of lack of strength of the circulation, (check Adrenal
    Glands for energy level with Selenium and Berberis)
    and then the Thyroid should be checked for  a cause (why?)  for the Myom.
     Appendicitis can also come in as a cause here.. 

     
    It all goes around in a negative spiral that Chiren treatments can help
    change.

    2nd question:

    Why she matches on Polio and Mumps without vaccinations?
    The Mumps and Poliomyelitis in Chiren are the information of the diseases
    themselves. She can match on information valid in her system due to
    exposure to the disease. 
    It is a false truth that the disease is no longer active/ available in the
    world. Mostly the illness has mutated away from the vaccinations, so the
    vaccinations give false security too. 

    Johan has a theory, based on the experience with a young girl, that
    vaccinations can be transmitted energetically. This girl was the only one
    not vaccinated in class, but all the diseases that were in the vaccination
    of her classmates were measured on her with the Chiren after she came into
    contact with the vaccinated children. The information had transferred to
    her...
    I believe we are more energetic than we tend to think and we measure on
    information that can travel and it influences groups and individuals.
   
    In practical use with Chiren, it means we have to rely on the measurements
    and listen to the signals from the body, instead of "trusting" what the
    Client tell us. This way we do not overlook things (when we assume they are
    not there) and prevent true healing to take place. 
   
    Poliomylitis is one of the biggest disturbances of the TW and lames the
    Pituitary Gland and other glands from operating at their best and true
    potential. It plays a key role in the body's own defence system.

    Hi Yelyena,

    About the DEN Combi you measured

    With the DEN combi matching the Stomach meridian you also have to very
    carefully look at your client's dental health. Whenever there's a serious
    tooth/jaw problem that doesn't go away, it has a major effect on the rest
    of the body and it is observed to completely block the results with Chiren
    treatment if it is not dealt with. Infections in other areas of the body
    often don't resolve as long as there are infections in the mouth

    The thing with combination remedies is that you don't know what you're
    dealing with. It could be an inflammation of the gums, serious tooth decay
    or even jawbone infection/inflammation. Anyway if it is not gone in the
    next treatment, measure for the specific tooth remedy that's needed and ask
    your client if she's having problems with her teeth.... and try to find a
    solution.

    Infections in the mouth can cause bacteria to go into the digestive tract,
    where they cause all kinds of infections or into the bloodstream, which
    directly affects the Heart and Circulation. In cases with serious tooth
    infections I've corrected the Circulatory meridian, Venous meridian and
    Heart meridian several times with Pyrogenium (helps with serious infections
    and blood poisoning). 

    Sometimes the Chiren treatment is not enough to get rid of tooth problems,
    especially when there are tooth/jaw abscesses and then the only thing you
    can do is send the client to a good dentist or surgeon and hope they can
    clean it up. Tooth extraction is usually a healthier solution than any
    other procedure, but of course this is usually not the road a client wants
    to take... 
    Of course you first see for about three treatments with a focus on the
    teeth if there's any improvement there, before making the decision that the
    Chiren is not going to work. You always have to give it some time....
    unless things are very acute of course. 

    About the hernias:

    If the dental issue is not that big and it is gone the next treatment, you
    can continue to treat with a focus on the Gallbladder and the Liver. 
    Although the Liver is not showing, it is most likely involved since the
    diaphragm is a muscle and hernia's there can be caused by muscle weakness.
    Gallbladder problems hardly ever stand alone.... a diseased Liver is
    usually hiding behind it.

    I don't think in her case the acid problems are due to a lack or excess of
    stomach acid although the Gallbladder has a big issue with the Cirrhosis
    that you measure. But with a hiatal hernia the acid flows back into the
    oesophagus, which doesn't have the protection against acid that the stomach
    has and this causes heartburn. As long as the hernia is not gone there will
    most likely be an acid problem. Even the normal dose that is needed to
    digest food can flood into the oesophagus and damage the thin lining or
    even cause ulcers there.

    In this case it makes sense to maybe use some baking soda, this won't have
    the same counterproductive effect on the Chiren treatment as the drugs that
    suppress stomach acid production. It is not optimal since it will get in
    the way of digesting the food and the killing of bacteria by stomach acid,
    but as long as she has those hernia's she's digesting the lining of her
    oesophagus and that's painful and damaging too...

    Hi
    The baking soda should be taken between meals and be sure that the baking
    soda is clean often you will find that it is mixed with aluminium. I not
    quite sure about how long you must take the baking soda. 1/2 a thespoon i
    biofotonwater 3 times a day.

    There's a difference between structural and functional problems. 

    Because there is a structural problem (hernia) that causes stomach acid
    problems, this is not readily resolved with Chiren treatment. So in this
    situation, that might have been caused by a functional problem but now is
    structural, the only thing you can do is take some anti-acids that are the
    least harmful. Baking Soda might be one. I don't know much about it.

    If the Gallbladder and Stomach function well there's going to be a normal
    stomach acid production that even might increase the acid problems because
    of the structural problem. So Chiren treatment is for this not the
    solution.

    The cause of the the hernia (Liver/Gallbladder) of course have to be
    treated. The muscles of the diaphragm can restore this way, but I don't
    think everything will automatically come back in the right place.

    People without this special condition should not take baking soda? 

    Is baking soda good or bad?

    There's no clear cut, black and white answer to that. You always have to
    weigh every aspect...

    Healthy people shouldn't take baking soda of course. It is still not
    natural and why should you take something to neutralize stomach acid if
    this doesn't cause a problem. The stomach should be acidic for proper
    digestion!

    But if because of a structural problem, the acid comes in places where the
    organs are not meant to be exposed to it (the stomach wall is protected if
    healthy, duodenum and oesophagus are not), this creates damage of the
    tissues which can lead to acid burns, ulcerations, scarring and ultimately
    cancer. 

    A structural situation can't be changed by Biophoton treatment alone and in
    this case baking soda can help in damage control.

    Also when the stomach wall is damaged and there are ulcers (but no
    irreparable structural problem), it can be helpful to neutralize the acid
    for a while so the wall is allowed to heal without being "digested" by the
    acid all the time. This is temporary symptom management.

    Thank you very much Nora, Karolina and Johan!

    Session 6:

    Cramps shoulder/neck, pains/stiffness, headaches and migraines all gone.
    Also, she noted that she does not "react to her problems in the same way"
    anymore.
    She was diagnosed with “Silent migraines” (white circle appears in her
    visual field... in the eye?)

    Acid Reflux – only once a day
    Loose stools (not quite diarrhea) in the morning; she was diagnosed with
    Irritable Bowel Syndrome more then 10 years ago

    Measurements:

    Spin Inversion – was reversed with saliva today

    Treatment: >12 Year Program
    Triple Warmer (R) - Little Flannel Flower, Ovarium
    Nervous System – Mercury (teeth with "silver" fillings)
    Veins – Atropinum
    Circulation (R) two points – Barijodeel and Aurumheel (second time; first
    time - month ago)
    Liver (showed up again!) – Hepatitis A
    Appendix Point, Lymph, Small Intestines (Left) - Chlamydia Trachomatis
    (that was very interesting today)

    I failed to restore the Appendix Point and 2 Lymphatic points(R)
    Also, Small Intestines (left) did not match to any remedies on the usual
    list (food poisoning, etc.) and her Bladder and Kidney were not dropping to
    "destroy Small Intestines" so to speak.

    I was looking for “stuff” behind Appendix point because Appendicitis/
    Tonsillitis would not do it and usual suspects (Strep. Staph, Salmonella)
    did not work either, so I remembered that Chlamydia might be behind – and
    Chlamydia Trachomatis matched. Interesting that drops on Small Intestines
    (Left) were restored too.

    I was very puzzled by Small Intestines being restored with Chlamydia and
    went to research correlation/s with my client conditions.
    This is what I found: "Chlamydia Trachomatis = usually found in mucous rich
    environments- single most important infectious agent “associated with
    blindness” (not in my client) - can cause pelvic inflammatory diseases (one
    of them is degeneration of myoma and also enteritis (with diarrhea as a
    symptom)".
    One can find this information under Differential diagnosis that must be
    considered if Chlamydia Trachomatis is present.

    Also, Johan suggested to use remedies Luesinum and Medorrhinum for her cold
    hands/feet. I am keeping that in mind for the future session but today did
    not give them to her because I would like to see how Chlamydia works for
    her. After all it is "the cause of most venereal diseases" (according to
    our manual).

    Footplate Treatment:
    Bacterias 4X
    Connective tissue – Osteoheel, Discus Compositum
    Kidneys were dropping after hand treatment - Albumoheel

    Question:
    Could Small Intestines (Left) being restored by Chlamydia Trachomatis? I
    really want to know but I will see my client in two weeks.
    I will suggest her to use baking soda (Aluminum free) when she has her Acid
    Reflux symptom.

    Dental issue, as inflammation" did not measure so today. Her Liver/
    Gallbladder condition seem to get better and Liver was measurable today
    (down to Hepatitis)

    Karolina, this information also belongs to "Hernia, etc." topic. I do not
    know if I should post it twice. It is the same client. Your choice, please.

    Thank you. Yelyena

    About the Chlamydia Trachomatis on the Small Intestines: If this is what
    you measured it could be a useful remedy.... although it is not the "usual
    suspect". 

    The profile of Chlamydia Trachomatis fits the symptoms in the Intestines,
    so it is not completely strange for it to resonate with the condition of
    your client. 
    However what I do think is strange, is that the Lungs don't drop in this
    case, since a remedy usually fits a pattern pretty well and Chlamydia is
    mostly indicated for the Lungs. If a "Chlamydia Pneumonia type of energy"
    is in the body the Lungs would be out of balance too most likely...  

    You'll just have to wait until the next treatment to see how the Intestines
    have responded on this remedy. It would be very interesting for us all to
    know if her loose stool has changed.


    Your choice of support I don't completely understand. Since the Liver shows
    itself with Hepatitis A, and the Liver is causative in her symptoms, I
    would choose Liver Support instead of Intestinal Flora (or did you measure
    a need for this?).

    Follow up:

    Symptoms: "loose stool" is still present (today she was fine, though)....

    She did not make any changes in her sugar/cakes diet. I stressed an
    importance of changing her diet and gave her the link to watch "Hungry for
    Change" movie; also suggested to use baking soda in case she needs any for
    her Acid Reflux.

    Measurement: all drops on her Small Intestines are gone. & No Spin
    Inversion anymore!
    Gallbladder - Cholecystitis 
    Lung - Coxsackie B-4
    LI (R) - Belladonna,  Carc.Coli (App. point is "clear")
    Fatty tissue - Galium
    After this her energy body was balanced. 

    Coxsackie virus (have tested for this in previous sessions, but now 
    "matched" for the first time on upper 2 Lung points, also tested for
    Chlamydia Pneumoniae  and Coxsackie A-9 but they never matched). 

    Luesinum and Medorrhinum I used for her cold hands/feet.

    Next session is in three weeks but I asked her to Email me if her loose
    stool gets better.

    Also, she asked me if I would make cards for her because "her friend bought
    ChiKey" and she can use it for free. That is another issue that I am not
    clear on. I probably would make card with Atropinum/Spascupreel/Ozaliet for
    her but I have no idea what is he friend is going to use her ChiKey for.

    Yelyena,
    You note your client takes a Statin. That drug alone could account for most
    of her functional symptoms. Diarrhea (as well as other gastrointestinal
    complaints) is a well know adverse effect, especially in small framed
    women.

    Other side effects of Statins: muscle pain (most common), all sorts of
    muscle problems including a breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis),
    ALS-like syndrome, clogging kidneys (could result in kidney failure), mild
    to severe memory loss (incl. periods of amnesia), pancreatitis, peripheral
    neuropathy (frequently a permanent side effect that does not go away with
    stopping the drug), disruption of insulin function resulting in diabetes,
    Liver dysfunction and mitochondrial myopathy.
    Basically any organ system can be adversely impacted by a statin.

Difference Chiren and Other Instruments

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
July 2014 edited July 2014 in Other Therapies & Instruments Flag
1. The Chiren uses biophoton emission = NOT bioluminescence

2. The Chiren works with information of remedies = NOT frequencies

3. The Chiren uses the body’s/cell’s OWN generated light = NOT machine
generated artificial light for therapy (blue light is only a visual
indication!)

4. The Chiren directly monitors and corrects the effect of given information on
biophoton coherence (health) = it does NOT expose to the danger of bringing
unwanted disturbing energies into the body (when used according to protocol)

5. The Chiren is in communication with only the client = the practitioner is
NOT part of the treatment cycle (and could only form a disturbance in
measurement, because of projection but there’s no danger of energies of the
practitioner harming the client)

6. The Chiren only delivers what the body asks = NOT what the practitioner
projects

7. The Chiren has a low pressure probe, causing less stress on acupuncture
points, allowing for a more accurate reading = NOT a high pressure probe like
Voll’s acupuncture system, that causes to get inaccurate readings because of
stressed acupuncture points.

8. The Chiren principle is based on biofeedback of the body’s own light, which
makes the delivery of information targeted= it does NOT deliver information
randomly

9. The Chiren is the only instrument that uses fiber optic technology, which is
the only possible way to transmit light/biophotons = NOT like other
instruments, claiming to work with biophotons, that use electrical wires and
probes

10. The Chiren is probably the only instrument that has been spread solely
through word of mouth for 28 years (hundreds of instruments were sold,
thousands of clients have been helped!), results speak for themselves! = NOT
like other instruments that have a strong marketing campaign and organization
behind them from the start

    Question:
    Can you please explain the concept of how the "information of remedies"
    works in the body? I havehad the understanding (or misunderstanding) that
    inverted frequencies neutralize other frequencies which in turn then works
    to balance the body. 
  •

    July 2014 edited July 2014 Flag
    Frequencies are used as a model to explain and understand what happens,
    since "information" is such an abstract subject that is hard to grasp…

    But the way the homeopathic remedies are put into the Chiren and come out
    of the Chiren excludes the use of frequencies. The remedies are information
    that travels on biophotons. 

    Biophotons can be observed as frequencies though…

    Hello, can this be viewed in relation to the particle vs. wave
    contradiction in physics?  Can a 'wave' be the phenomenon of what is
    observed as a frequency and the information as the 'particle'?  Or, Since
    experiments show that all 'particles'  can be also viewed as a wave and
    visa versa we are left with where the 'information' is ...
    Since light can be seen as coherent, WHITE, ? and as color, maybe the color
    is the 'frequency' that is also the information.  So, biophotons are
    'particles' and the wave is the frequency, when the cell is healthy it
    reflects coherent white or color and when not then coherency is lost?  I
    wonder...
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    July 2014 edited July 2014 Flag
    No, this is not the same. The particle and the wave are both the light,
    looked at from a different perspective. The (bio)photon or lightwave is the
    carrier of information, but not the information itself.

    There will be no tangible answer as to what information is… it is in the
    realm of quantum mechanics.. very abstract, and an extremely frustrating
    concept for the brain to grasp.

    In contrast, the coherency of light, of course, does have to do with light
    viewed as a wave. 

    * Information can cause a response in the cell/tissue/organ that is healing
    => and healthy tissue emits coherent biophotons. So in this way the
    (homeopathic)information indirectly influences biophoton coherence

    * The light filtering system however also inverts the frequency of
    unhealthy biophotons => and influences biophoton coherence directly, while
    at the same time cancelling out unhealthy information
  •

    July 2014 Flag
    Very interesting....
  • 
    SVitale
    July 2014 Flag
    Question:  While the light filtering system inverts the 'frequency' of
    unhealthy biophotons to coherent, healthy ones, when we 'enter' a remedy
    into the Chiren don't we have to enter it either directly (i.e. X) or
    inverted (i.e. 1/X).
    The reason for my question, I am trying to understand the relationship
    between the photon and the remedy.  Even though the Chiren will 'correct' 
    the non coherent photons, this seems independent of the remedy's
    action.?.... Reference to the 'tic' case study.....It seems to me that the
    homeopathic law of similars, which is dose related, enters into the
    situation, but simply inverting a mother tincture in the Chiren is not the
    answer, is it?.  Would one have to actually make a dilution to 10D to get
    the true inverstion?

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    July 2014 Flag
    * Dilutions below D10 are similar in information and action to the mother
    tincture
    * D10 is neutral and does not do anything
    * Above D10 the information and action are opposite to the action of the
    mother tincture

    Potencies have a definite effect on the strength of a remedy. Just
    inverting will not result in an equally powerful remedy. A D30 or D200
    potency both have an opposite effect, but there is a difference as the
    higher potency works on older/deeper problems and also more on the
    emotional level.

    In the Chiren, the remedy is brought into the light after the inversion of
    negative frequencies/information of the own light has taken place. So the
    homeopathic information will be brought into contact with the body as they
    are (not inverted).

    I hope this is the information you are looking for...

Thyroid Meds & Chikey

ecox
January 2014 edited January 2014 in Medication Flag
I'm thinking about using the chikey to help a client taper off thyroid
medication between treatments.

She has been on medication (both T3 and T4) for about 15 years now.  Her latest
test results show that her thyroid activity is too high. I think treatments
have started to get her thyroid working again.

 She tried to reduce just a sliver of a pill and became disoriented .  She went
back on the full dose, but still would like to taper off.

Question:  What do you think of doing the following:

1) Making a chikey card with strumeel, thalmus, and thyroidea that she would
use every day (or every 3 days) on prog. 1 to support the thyroid while she
tries to taper off?

2) And treating the thyroid with the rods on the scar program before each
treatment?

3) Would you add any other remedies to the card?

Or do you have a better way to approach this?

    When the Thyroid level is too high, the Thyroid medication would be counter
    productive, so this is a good indication to lower the dose...

    Questions:
    How does the Hormonal System measure? Are there still any drops? 
    How does the disorientation manifest? Is it dizziness? Dizziness can be a
    withdrawal symptom.

    Answers:
    1) Measurements should be done before and after she reduces the doses. 
    If the Thyroid drops after she has reduced the dose, you should try to
    balance it again and see what remedy is necessary and use this on the card.
    Use the Chikey card no more than once every 3 days on program 2.
   
    2) Scar treatment over the Thyroid doesn't serve any purpose, it doesn't
    give any added benefit.
   
    3) I would also add Viscum and Thalamus to a treatment, since Pituitary and
    Pineal normally greatly influence the Thyroid.

    The specific symptoms of reducing the thyroid for one week (without the
    chikey) were as follows:

    Extreme fatigue
    Brain fog
    Muscle weakness and pain
    Disrupted sleep
    Constipation

    Question:
    Do you think this was just withdrawal?

    I will get a better idea of her status this week when we have her session.
    She is back on full dose of thyroid medication for now.

    It can be withdrawal, but you will need to measure what is going on with
    the Hormone System. 

    If the Hormone System and especially Thyroid and Pituitary are balanced,
    and you try to lower the dose again with similar symptoms coming up, you
    should immediately measure and treat her.

    Of course you could try and use the Chikey for this too, but then you don't
    have the measurement to monitor what is going on...

    I read in the manual that Lymphomyosot has the information of inverted
    thyroid medication. The bloodresults of my client showed that she got to
    much medication. Her doctor wanted her to build off the medication very
    slowly. When I measure her every time her Thyroid and her Pineal gland
    drop, but if I use Lymphomyosot it is corrected....till she takes her too
    high dose of medication ofcourse... Maybe this can be helpful for your
    client too!

    your next project!) will become more and more apparent with the improved
    results I feel we will see in our work. 
    Back in 2011 when I started to walk on this Path of Biontology, there was
    hardly any sort of foundation to stand on; and look at what is available
    now! 
    This is not only helpful for the new students, but also for us, to clear up
    the mist in our heads and the mistakes we made because of our unclear
    foundation.
    None of us want to harm our clients, so it is also important to me that it
    is now clear what NOT to do, and why.
    To know where the risks lie, because we all have seen the brilliance of the
    Chiren and we know we can see results without even having much
    understanding at all, but at the same time, we can also cause serious
    damage when we recklessly treat.
    To keep Biontology safe, this foundation you now have given is priceless!
    Such a big relief...supergreatfull
    (((LOVE)))

    I mistakenly ordered two copies of the remedy book. If anyone would like to
    order it from within the US, feel free to contact me. It is boxed and ready
    to go. Was trying to send back to US Office but waiting for transition time

New Remedy Update

Sophia AlexanderSophia Alexander
October 2014 edited November 2014 in Technical Questions Flag
First of all, thank you all so much for your integrity in this transition time.
It is difficult on all of us, and I am heartened to feel your professionalism.

I have a question about the new remedy update. Is it necessary to install the
previous update (memory upgrade) before downloading the remedy update? I don't
need the extra memory so have not downloaded it. However, I am very nervous to
install the remedy update without knowing the answer to this question.

With love and gratitude,
Sophia

    Hello.
    My update don't seem to work. I did the exact update procedure as written
    in the emails that we received yesterday from IABS. I tried it 7, 8 times.
    But I still do not see the new remedies. Here is the last message on Chiren
    screen. May be this link with the screen image may help with the problem.
    Please let me know if you have any advise.
    Thank you.

    * The new remedy update has the memory update included so there is no
    reason to worry

    * I think that the Chiren does not recognise the USB stick. especially in
    the US sometimes you need to try various thumb drives. The problem exists
    because USB stick manufacturers use different chips. In any case try a
    thumb drive with little memory.

    These two instructions seem to contradict ea. other

    1. After applying this update, it is VITAL that the Chiren only be started
    without external USB drives attached, otherwise user data will not be
    loaded properly. So don't start the Chiren up again with the USB stick
   
    2.

    3. Insert USB-drive with update file into one of the USB ports of the
    Chiren®

    4. Turn on the Chiren®

    1) The thumb drive that you received with the Chiren, must be made clean
    before you put the new update on it. Please use this USB stick because we
    know it works

    2) I do not think it contradicts. Instruction states that AFTER you do the
    update, you remove the thumb drive.
    Your point 3 indicates merely the instruction to insert the thumb drive to
    do the update.

    I still have not been successfully in getting the new remedies installed. I
    first tried the USB drive that came with my Chiren, several times. Then I
    went out and bought a Kingston USB drive, still no luck. What to try next?

    I did notice right after the "Update from USB Drive" screen, that it says
    to take out the USB Drive and insert a USB Drive. I even tried that once.

    I'm expecting the new remedies to end up in alphabetical order with the old
    remedies, right?

    I think Sophia and I are having the same issue. We had the same USB sticks
    from Europe. And I emptied it before using it. I took a picture of Chiren
    screen message right before closing . If you click on the link below you
    will see the message. I don't know if that is an error message but I
    thought it may help.

    The updates need to be exactly done via the update procedure as explained
    in the manual. 

    The USB stick needs to be inserted in the Chiren
    Then you need to start up the instrument using the admin card.
    Then you start the update procedure.

    Kingston 4GB is indeed one of the sticks that seem to work well.

    Well, if anyone else is having a problem getting the new remedies
    downloaded, here is what I finally discovered after trying about 6
    different USB sticks. I have a Mac and when I would put a USB stick in my
    Mac to download the update onto, it would format it for a Mac. Thus, it
    would not be compatible with the Chiren. I had to get a neighbor with a PC
    to download the file for me, and Voila! it worked fine. So for any of you
    with Mac's, this is probably a solution for you.

    I also request a description of the new remedies that are not in the new
    remedy book.

    Thank you! Love to all

    Whether you have a Mac or a PC, it should not make any difference.
    The computer is only there as a transfer medium and should not get into the
    formatting mode at all. The computer language in the updates is
    incompatible with both Apple and Windows.

    All that one should do is to drag it from downloads to the USB stick.

    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    November 2014 edited November 2014 Flag
    Here's the follow up about freeing up space with the update:
    What the memory update does is release stored items that are no longer
    necessary.
    Stored client data will not be released, so if there is a lot of this, a
    lot less can be released.
    In this case the patient data should be exported and then deleted on the
    Chiren.

    Client data can be exported to a USB drive. We have a computer program
    available that can read the data. You can then look at client data at your
    PC. This PC program, however, is not available for Mac.
    In this case the data cannot be reimported.

    One can however also store all the data of a patient on a chip card, which
    makes it possible to reimport the data.

    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    November 2014 edited November 2014 Flag
    Some new insights about the update:
    The memory update does not automatically increase your memory.
    What I have understood now, one has to first free up memory by exporting
    data to a USB stick or to a card.
    The update only allocates a different space to store things. After this
    update has been installed things will be stored more efficiently.
    The present data base will remain in tact however, and thus the indicated
    memory space too if you don't remove anything yourself.

    Probably been asked a thousand times, but is there a way to cover metal, to

    Magnetic fields penetrate everything. The bed also acts as antenna for
    various frequencies.
    The bed is probably made with different metals which are in contact with
    each other.

    Possible "solutions":
    A. One can limit the effect by sleeping on a sheepskin.
    B. You can ground the bed by connecting it through an electric wire to the 
    ground plug in a wall socket.
    C. I have also been told that an iron stick under the bed may help. This
    iron stick is said to draw the field downwards, thus not exposing the body
    to the field as much. 

    Perhaps best is to try all three systems simultaneously 

    Best solution:
    But the best solution, of course, is to sleep on a metal-free bed.

    You know I emailed lessemf.com and they said a solid anti megetic alloy
    would do the trick, but I'm confused.  It seems yet another metal on the
    metal would just create another magnetic field.  I think the best is to rid
    the metal bed.  The complaint of the disturbance is on one side of the bed
    but not the other so I think there is a Hartman or Curry lines that are
    either the cause or the combination of the metal and the ley lines....

Explaining Biontology

Beate
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Biontology Insights Flag
Questions:
1. Copying remedies was and still is very popular among practitioners. How can
we be sure that the Remedy is an "identical item"? 

2. When neutralising something, does it disappear and become unmeasurable in a
blood sample, or does it only change the energetic field? 

3. What would be the best way to explain the "energetic field" to a person not
familiar with this terminology. 

4. I'd like to know more about how to explain the miracels brought to our
gestalt with Biophoton Coherence therapy.

    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    April 2013 edited June 2015 Flag
    Answers:
    1. As long as you follow the instructions for copying, the Information of
    the Remedy will be on the card. When something has gone wrong, you will
    notice a lack of effect of the Remedy soon enough.
   
    I am Not Advocating any extra Remedies though. One can compare the Symptoms
    to the leaves of a tree, whereby every Symptom is a leaf. There might be
    many sick leaves and you might find a different Remedy for every sick
    leave. Every branch of the tree, every leaf is slightly different. But in
    stead of treating the leaves, one should concentrate one the stem, the
    roots or the soil. The Cause of the problems is there. 
    In this way one does not have to treat the leaves, the Symptoms. For
    Treating those areas, there are plenty of Remedies in the system. I
    generally use only a fraction of the remedies in the system and in practice
    have always gotten excellent results.
   
    2. If there are for example Heavy Metals, Chemicals in the Tissue than the
    Remedy which contains the opposite or Homeopathic Information of the
    particular Metal or Chemical, the body should release the Metal/Chemical,
    since the Metal / Chemical becomes neutral and therefore loses its binding
    properties. Everything that is neutral cannot bind it self.
    The Metals or Chemicals can then be seen in the blood and later in the
    urine to be expelled.

    3. All Information and Memory of the body is stored in Biophotons.
    Biophotons are Information Packages,
    Einstein has already said that Matter does not exist, everything is Energy.
    Once certain Energy is at its most Dense state, it appears Matter and one
    can see it.
    We are Energy, we are Light, in an ever decreasing Field (counting from the
    Body which is the most Dense). 

    For example:
    If the Centre (the body) is a strong red, then it fades more and more the
    further you go away from the body. There is no end to this. All
    Manifestation moves in Vortexes, whereby the end of the Vortex, the Point,
    is the Manifestation. Before this Point of Manifestation, everything is
    Energy.This Energy is a Blueprint for everything that comes into Existence.
    This Blueprint is Information, that can or can not come into Existence.
    This depends on Resonance and Circumstances (other Information). 
    Memory cannot be found in the Body. Memory is stored on Biophotons which
    for ever are Bonnected to the Body. Because they are Light, they move with
    the speed of Light. An event that happened 20 years ago is stored on
    Biophotons which now are twenty Lightyears away. Yet you can get this
    Information back in a split second. 
    This is what we call Quantum Mechanics. In Quantum Mechanics there is no
    Time and no Space. We are all Sending and Receiving Stations. In order to
    Remember something or Recognize something, all we have to do is "tune in".
    This Tuning In can happen both Consciously and Unconsciously. If somebody
    says particular words, a whole range of Memories can be Triggered and
    entering your system and everything related to those words will come, often
    far more than you thought was possible. Often there are Memories that you
    thought were Unrelated, but they suddenly are Related and you suddenly
    Realize.
    Suddenly you are Remembering things that you had Suppresses or Forgotten,
    but the Light does not Forget. All it needs is the Right Trigger.

    If something Matches in Measurement, it means that there is Resonance with
    the Energy, with the Information of the Substance.
    This can be only a small part. If Memory happens to be this part, it will
    also Match because Memory is Information but there has to be Resonance.

    4. The Chiren and Starlight work so well because they work with the Body's
    Own Light and return it in the System of Biofeedback. Because it is all the
    Body's Own Light, it automatically has a 100% Resonance to it, also to the
    Disturbances. 
    The light filtering itself can be compared with blood dialysis. Karolina
    often explains the basic Chiren/Starlight function by saying it is a "light
    dialysis".

    The Remedies (=Information, not frequencies) we load into the System, are
    then Modulated on the Lightwaves that are emitted from the Body and sent
    back via the Fibre-Optic Cables. Because the Light waves are the Body's
    Own, the Information of the Remedy is Available Everywhere. If Any Part of
    the system has a Resonance with it, it will Receive this Information and
    deal with the Instructions that this Biophoton contains.

    There is always the big problem of "Projection". Very often the
    Practitioner Projects his/her Energy onto the Client. All Memories of the
    Practitioner are in the Energy Field.
    That is why I Advocate total Objectivity and try to take a Helicopter View,
    Totally Separated from the Client.
    For this Everybody has to set Boundaries to him/herself, to Respect him/
    herself and the Clients.
    From the Helicopter you see everything a lot Clearer.

She had a Car Crash (concussion and neck)

Medical interventions: Tonsils (tonsillitis),

Diseases: Borrelia?, MS, high cholesterol, Pfeiffer, Herpes ( both) , possible
Gonorrhea (Medorrhinum) long time ago, trouble with Thyroid gland,

Symptoms: Eye trouble, Coordination problem, Constipation (sometimes)

Medication: Cortison intravenously, lots of Penicillium( because of possible
borrelia),
She's still taking Simvastatin (high cholesterol) and Levaxin (for the thyroid)

chlorum weekly( because of her job)

Treatment:
Whiplash, Spin Inversion, Neutralized medication and mother and other mental/
emotional stuff ( a lot of talking),

Remedies used:
Vaccines, Child Diseases, Heavy Metals, Bacterias, Viruses, Appendicitis,
Tonsillits, Thyrodea, Strumeel, Lyme, Rubella, Penicillin, Cortison,
Chlorum, Medorrhinum, Luesinum, herpes S +Z, Polyps, ++++, Procrainum,
Trichonomaden, Standard Lyme treatment and others support and more

She has low energy and is often in Spin-Inversion

I haven’t used the Whiplash program from the perineum, only to the lower back.

She is sleeping on matress with coiles, and she’s wearing glasses, she has no
clockradio. She uses the mobile phone beside the head. I have told her to move
the phone away., etc

But she is telling she got more energy after a treatment.

Lately I found drops on Organ Degeneration. (Polyps and Mastopathia match)

I want some expert help ,because it is always a lot of disturbance and not easy
to find few thing that’s correct many places.

    Hello Tone,

    Your assessment and treatment are scattered. It goes all over the place and
    then you get nowhere. 

    * First thing we have to focus on is finding out what her symptoms are. If
    she is diagnosed for possible Lyme, MS, Pfeiffer and low Thyroid, she
    should have far more symptoms than just the eye-trouble, coordination
    problem and occasional constipation....  The list of diagnoses is longer
    than the list of symptoms.
   
    * You focus too much on diseases she was diagnosed with and too little on
    what her actual symptoms are. Diagnoses are distracting and not very useful
    to us. People are misdiagnosed all the time and what does MS actually
    mean....? So look at the symptoms and make your own assessment. 
   
    * I also like to know where you measured all those remedies. What meridians
    were showing drops and what meridians are still showing drops. 
   
    * And what emotional stuff is your client experiencing?
   
   
    Then some remarks about the treatment:
   
    * There is no Lyme protocol, just a group of remedies that have indications
    for symptoms that are caused by Lyme. They can be tested by measuring them.
    Never use recipes!
   
    * Don't neutralize medication that is still used and especially not the
    thyroid medication. The other medication you only have to neutralize once.
    Please read all my comments. There's a lot of information in there. If I
    read your case study, I think you missed a lot of that information.

    * I hardly ever treat the back with the Whip Lash program unless people
    experience pain there, then I treat the area of the pain locally to give
    some symptom relief for the client. I do this at the end of the session.

    * When she's in Spin Inversion all the time you won't get any real results.
    Somebody who's low in energy easily gets into Spin Inversion. How are her
    Adrenals? Cell Phone radiation weakens the aura and thus the ability of the
    body to protect against Spin Inversion.
   
    * Also you have to focus on finding out the source of the electro magnetic
    field that is causing the Spin Inversion. I would suggest her to put sheep
    skin over her mattress or buy a new one. If this she then again has a Spin
    Inversion you have to look at another source. The glasses can cause Spin
    inversion only when the frame is metal and this is rare, but it does happen
    sometimes.

    * You write, you use Chlorum in treatment because she is exposed to
    Chlorine a lot, is this because of her work? What is her work. Is she a
    cleaning lady? Or does she work at a Swimming pools?..... 


   
    So I need more information. What I can say about the symptoms you
    mentioned:

    * Coordination problems can be caused by the Spin Inversion alone.

    * Eye problems are usually caused by the Stomach and Duodenum.

    don’t want to quit swimming in the pool with the pupils.

    She has put the cell phone away from the head but still use it for wakeup.
    And I told her that you Looks like old trauma ( alcoholic mother and all
    around this has given a lot of problems. She got into spin during the
    measurement and I ask “what are you thinking about”. – an old car accident
    with her sister, a boy went to visit her and he got hit by a car and died,
    Her mother was chocked , and she maybe felt her mother rejected her. ( she
    told me) . She is also an psychodrama therapist ( more like a hobby).

    This time: Drop almost every places as usual.

    treated with pyrogenium, psorinum, app nec, tonsilitils,ulcus duodeni,
    granuloma denti, hepar, and (1/trauma in the cup).

    Adoma mammae, selenium, glyoxal, ubichinon, coenzyme, atropinum and support
    .

    She alsotake the bus 20min *2 to work , could this get her in spin? (I have
    told her to not sit over the engine)

    After this treatment she said that the energy got better. She is going to
    take a treatment with another biontologist, a friend of mine- with lot of
    experiences.

    Her eye problems will disappear when her Stomach problems have been
    solved. 

    I believe they are the cause of her eye problems. I would concentrate on
    treating the Stomach/Small Intestines problems plus their causes.

    I do not think that the bus drive is causing her Spin Inversion.

Therapy Resistance and Lyme's Disease

kathrynhowardkathrynhoward
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag

Client: Woman with "Lyme's Disease" (referred by Barbara from Connecticut), who
seemed to be Therapy Resistant. She came 4 times and said she didn't have any
response at all, although the 5th session she mentioned having less anxiety
attacks, better sleep and a few other good things.

Previous Treatments: I don't have her file right now, but I have done what you
have always said about this particular health issue -test -test -test. I've
treated what I've measured. She resonates (and I've treated her with) all the
right nosodes and supports for Lyme's disease and co-infections (Lyme's,
Bartonella, Borrelia, Q-Fever, Brucella Abortus Bang). I also found:
Leptospirose, Medorrinhum, Mezereum, Trichomonaden, and the list is long.

She does not take drugs, but was addicted to cocaine for one year (a long time
ago), Treated her for this when she resonated with it.

Each time she left my office, all points were balanced. And the next visit
there were less drops. She continued to have drops on: Liver, Lymphatic System,
Circulation, Gallbladder.

Until the last visit - no wonderful results.

5th Session (last time I saw her)
She started to talk about her mother for the first time. Mother was a control
freak, who pushed all the time when she was a child.
She also suddenly mentioned that she had terrible jaw pain. She had mentioned
before that she doesn't have great teeth, and I realize now that I should have
questioned her more deeply about that... Now she told she had 13 root canals
and 4 titanium/metal implants (novocaine every time!).

Symptoms:
Jaw Pain, Inability to sit still, must be on the move all the time, talking
negatively about herself,

Treatment:
On this 5th session, I finally treated her with everything we've got for the
Teeth, Gums, Jawbone.

Reaction:
She feels really awful, even dizzy (just received a text).

Support:
She lives to far away to give her any Supports in between.
But I told her she is finally detoxing and to try to work through it.
I even told her to take an Epsom salts and Baking Soda bath to help get the
toxins out.

Wish I had her file in front of me....
But since she texted me on a weekend and I am wondering if I need to worry
about her...

Questions:

1. Do you think it is okay that she feels so awful?

2. Do you think this is a real detox she is having?

3. Is it possible that the infection was encapsulated in her jawbone and
implants and root canals, sort of paralyzed there, and I have opened the
Pandora's box now to release all those infections?

4. What should my next move be?

    I will return Tuesday night with the exact treatment details. She returned
    my text offer to give her a short support treatment before I see her next
    Thursday, if she doesn't feel better by Monday afternoon.

    She is dedicated to continuing and seems to understand that it will take
    time. Hopefully, she will be able to tolerate detoxing enough to do this.

    1. I think it is normal that she feels awful. Any root canal will forever
    give infections and a lot of time abscesses and it is very difficult to get
    rid of. Those abscesses and infections are locked in the jaw and have
    nowhere to go. The only thing to try is the jaw remedies, Lymphomyosot and
    Myristica Sebifera (if you can get it)

    2. It is more likely that all the problems were pre-existent and should
    have been dealt with in the past. Instead they have been suppressed. Now
    suppression was lifted because of the Chiren treatment, the old problems
    become more acute. The body is working on solving the infections...
    Her restlessness can very well be caused by the Gallbladder, but something
    else you can try is Tuberculium.

    3. It occurs frequently that people feel worse the few days after a
    treatment.

    6th Treatment 3/28/13
    Not as many drops.

    Conversation:
    She repeats that she still has "No response."
    I ask, "Do you still have such anxiety?" "Oh no! That is much better."
    I ask, "Are you still not sleeping?" "That is better, too."
    We talk about why she is therapy resistant. I ask again for an outstanding
    symptom she hasn't talked about, and she tells me about her severe jawbone
    pain. "I've had 13 root canals and four implants." I tell her that I am
    going to work on that area of her head to try to unlock what is 'stuck' in
    there.

    Measurement:
    No drops on left hand.

    Heart (R) - 2nd point from bottom
    Organ Degeneration (R) - top 4 points
    Circulation (R) - 2nd point from top

    No drops on left foot.

    Stomach (R)

    (Clearly, there were less drops now than ever before.)

    >12 year Program:
    Plumbum Met (again), Mercury, Aluminum, Kieferostitis, Den Kombi,
    Paradontose, Lyme's, Bartonella (own remedy)

    Footplate Treatment:
    Arnica, Aesculus, Cat's Claw, Oculoheel, Otitis Media, Barijodeel,
    Aurumheel, Cerebrum, Viscum, Crowea, Southern Cross, Apis, Geovita (own
    remedy)

    She texted me after this last treatment, because she got so sick. I tried
    to get her come to me, but she is going to a neurologist ENT on Wednesday
    and seeing me Thursday.
    I told her that if the doctor puts her on strong drugs, I could not see her
    until she was finished with that. I am choosing not to treat this patient
    if she is on drugs.
    She asked me if I could get rid of her vertigo. Everything is 100%
    symptom-oriented with medical terminology - which I know is typical for
    Americans. Her daughter is studhing to be an M.D. This woman has done
    everything. She told me if I could fix her, she'd make me famous, because
    she hasn't been helped by anyone. She never went into all the things she's
    tried to do, but said she does not take drugs.

    I will add Tuberculinum and Lymphomyosot and Myrstica Sebifera, as you
    suggested, when I see her again - unless the Neurologist convinces her that
    the Chiren is not something she should continue. That would not surprise me
    either.

    Hi Kathryn,

    Thank you so much for your elaborate description of this case. It helps a
    lot in understanding how you work and makes it easier to help you with
    improving your therapy. There are several things I've noticed in your
    treatment:

    1. In your first treatment you say that you "Continued to use what had been
    measured and matched" on the footplates. If you filled 8 slots with
    remedies and just left them in how can it be that you use on the footplates
    what had been measured, did you take remedies out during measurement? Sorry
    I don't understand, in writing sometimes it is hard to figure everything
    out....

    2. The Parathyroid kept dropping several times and also the Circulation...
    When the Calcium metabolism is off like that you're likely to find
    Barijodeel or Aurumheel on the Circulation and also Kidney/Gallstones.
    Neuropathy and tingling according to Johan have a lot to do with
    Circulation.

    3. If there was no reason for the Whiplash to come back it might also be
    the Tonsils that cause disturbance in the throat area. But in this case it
    might have been the dental work too...

    4. Den Kombi is a remedy that we don't use anymore because we prefer to
    identify a problem as accurately as possible. It is a combination of
    Kieferostitis, Granuloma Denti and Paradontose, so it is strange to use Den
    Combi + two of its components... 

    5. Lyme's = Borrelia, so why the double?

    6. Spin Inversion is not measured only on the Pituitary. All 6
    Spin-Inversion points need to drop steeply.

    7. Whiplash is measured on both Thyroid and Parathyroid. If one of these is
    not dropping there's no Whiplash. Johan sometimes says he only measures
    this on the Thyroid, but that is because he knows that in the first
    treatment the Parathyroid almost always drops.

    8. With that many drops in the first treatment (even after Spin-Inversion
    and Whiplash) it is very likely that you've overlooked Appendicitis
    Necroticans. Even when all of a sudden there were less drops, that might
    have been caused by suppression. I've personally never seen severe tooth
    problems without severe Gastro-Intestinal problems.

    7. Considering your choice of remedies, I feel you were not completely
    objective in your testing.  It is easy to go with the diagnosis of Lyme and
    think you need to treat it. It looks like a Lyme-recipe you've used. In
    Biontology the diagnoses should not have any focus. The way to go about is
    to look at the symptoms and measure and treat in the sequence that is most
    helpful to the body and in this case nosodes of Inflammations (-itises,
    ulcers or cirrhosis) of Yang organs were very likely to be needed. The
    measurement protocol shows you what to test for first. 

    8. I don't understand your choice for all the "own remedies" (outside of
    the standard package), while you don't use the most important and effective
    nosodes in the Chiren. Especially if after one treatment you see that your
    own remedies didn't have any effect you should discard them and look at
    something more effective. Repeating remedies several times is something you
    should not do if there was no result (shift in the wellbeing of the
    client). Even if a remedy seems to balance a lot of drops, if it doesn't
    have any effect in changing the situation of the client it is not an
    effective remedy....

    9. Relaxation and less anxiety are common effects of the Chiren treatment,
    but if other severe symptoms don't clear up something is overlooked. In
    this case, you made a big discovery about the dental problems that were
    overlooked earlier and this is obviously the first thing to focus on. 
   
    So Therapy Resistance might not be the problem.... now you shifted your
    focus to the dental problem all of a sudden something is changing in her
    body. Probably what really needs to happen is that her mouth is cleaned up
    physically, which means that the root canals have to come out... I don't
    think many people will be happy to do this...

    10. When you put in the Dental remedies, did they correct most drops on
    Heart, Circulation, Organ Degeneration and Stomach? All of these organs can
    be affected by Dental problems..... I'm just wondering and try to see if
    patterns I've found are found by others too... 

    Very good case to learn from and I'm very curious as to how it evolves with
    such a "sick" mouth... Even though there are some things that could have
    been done differently to be more effective, I'm wondering if your client
    can be helped as long as the root canals and implants are still in place..

    Karolina - Thank you very much for your long response. I just want to
    answer some of your questions to make sure we are clear about a few items.

    #1: I did not continue to use any of the remedies that I used in the 8
    slots for the footplates. I never do that. Because she had so many health
    issues (more than I have ever seen before), I went ahead and tested and
    matched other remedies after I cleared her with the 8 slots, because I
    wanted to be sure I didn't use anything on the footplates that would cause
    her to have drops again. I listed the different remedies that I used on the
    footplates, so I thought that was clear. Sorry about that.

    #2 and #3: I thought when the Parathyroid and Circulation points dropped
    (the two near the hand on both), one was always to do Whiplash and Spin,
    not only during the first treatment. I have completely misunderstood this,
    if this is not the case. Do you mean that one should not be repeating Spin
    and/or Whiplash when these points drop - except on the first treatment? I
    need to be really clear about this, as I think it is so important and
    always plays such a huge role in the drops. Her drops disappeared after I
    did the Spin and Whiplash.

    I will see her tomorrow. I will test her for Barijodeel and Aurumheel to
    see if they resonate. Thank you. I do know about these and have used them
    on many of my clients with great responses. I just didn't get there with
    this client, because she responded so well to all the Lyme's remedies.

    #4: I did not know that Den Kombi was a combination of the other three.
    Thank you. I will not use it anymore.

    #5:Again, I did not know that Lyme's was the same as Borrelia. Thank you
    again! I thought Borrelia was a co-infection. This is why I prefer to do
    research on many of the remedies, but I did not do it for Borrelia.
    Question: If the Lyme's remedy is supposed to help, why do they resonate
    for both of these?

    #6 & #7: Yes, I do know that. I always measure the 6 points first before I
    do anything else. I only wrote this for you to know that the drops cleared
    on these two points immediately. She had all points dropping on the
    Circulation and Heart, and those also cleared with the Spin and Whiplash.
    Should I have tested her for Barijodeel and Aurumheel after these points
    cleared, just to see if she resonated with them?

    Note: In reading what I sent you, I noticed that I forgot to list what I
    did on the 5th Treatment... I don't have her file at home. Sorry. IF you
    want to see that, let me know and I'll bring her file home again. You might
    not need this now.

    #8: I will definitely try the Appendicitis Necroticans tomorrow.

    #7: (repeated number in your list) I will do the Yang organs and what you
    wrote when I treat her tomorrow. Thank you very much. I agree that I used
    too much of the Lyme's protocol. I don't usually like protocols!

    #8: (repeated number in your list) I did not mean "MY own remedies" ... I
    got these while I was in Walnut Creek (I thought these were from Johan and
    his students out there). I only wrote "own remedies" because I had to
    download them into that category in the Chiren, and wanted you and Johan to
    know that. Sorry. I should have explained that better.

    All of the following I downloaded into "own remedies" while in Walnut Creek
    in December: Herpes formula, Borrelia, Blue Belly Lizard, Bartonella
    Lyme's, Cat's Claw, Myrstica Sebifera, along with the 22 cards (some of
    these come from those, too, I think).

    The only remedy that I have downloaded into the Chiren is "Geovita" - which
    is a high-quality Pleo-Sanum homeopathic remedy used to test for geopathic
    stress. I have found this one works very well. It helps me to know if a
    person has severe geopathic stress in their home and/or office and if I
    need to go and check that out for them (since I do geopathic stress
    consultations - which have nothing to do with supplements or other healing
    modalities). I asked Johan one day about that in class, and he agreed that
    geopathic stress can be a major problem. I have found that to be true since
    the 1970s, when I first studied about earth energies and learned how to
    measure them by a renown scientist in Stockholm, Sweden. He took
    military men out into the middle of nowhere and taught them how to survive
    based on Stone Age methods. Dowsing was one - to find water.

    #8 continued: I did have some remarkable changes in her drops after a few
    of the sessions, but she still didn't have any response until I hit her
    hard with the remedies for her mouth.

    This woman is not going to remove the root canals, that much I am sure
    about. Question: HOW does one take out a root canal? What is left after
    that? Don't you have to use an implant to have a tooth there?

    #10: Yes. However, the drops all went away before she left my office with
    each treatment. It was after I worked on the mouth that she got so sick
    though.

    Outcome today: She did go to a Neurologist ENT. We texted back and forth,
    and when she came out of his office, she texted me that his diagnosis is
    "positional vertigo." !! I asked her if that was all he said was wrong with
    her. Yes. Unbelievable. Her son is driving her tomorrow and I will treat
    her. This time, I will treat her for her drops specifically - using the
    list from Johan that he sent out, and then test what I have for vertigo,
    too. He did not give her any drugs, thankfully! I think this woman is on
    the road to better health, but I agree with you that it might be an uphill
    battle for her with a mouth full of such toxins. I will test her for
    infection, abscess, and everything Johan wrote yesterday.

    Again, big thanks to you and Johan for all that you have written about this
    case. I so appreciate it.
    Kathryn

    1. This was just not completely clear to me, thank you for your
    clarification. If you still have drops after the Hand Treatment, you can
    continue to measure for remedies to correct the points that drop. There's a
    self-corrective cycle in the Footplates, so even if a component of a
    support remedy would cause imbalance (which could happen when for example
    taken orally) this is not a problem. This is why, when everything is
    corrected, you can just add support for the organ systems that need it
    without further measuring (there are no drops to match them on anymore
    anyway). 

    2 & 3 Good to get some confusion out of the way ;-) It is all in the
    Measurement Protocol....
    Whiplash and Spin Inversion are not a combination package. They must be
    properly identified before you used either of them. They are not to be used
    as a standard treatment. Any treatment that you'll do before complete
    measurement will balance drops, because this is the inherent effect of the
    filtering and amplifying of ones own light. 
    Spin-Inversion is diagnosed when on the left hand all following 6 points
    drop steeply (energetically):
    2 points close to the hand of Hormonal System
    2 points close to the hand of Heart
    2 points close to the hand of Circulation
    Whiplash is diagnosed when both Parathyroid and Thyroid drop.
   
    The Lyme remedies responded energetically, but didn't have a physical
    response. Usually they are not the ones that are going to clear the
    condition when someone has Lyme's Disease. They can be used maybe as a kind
    of support but the focus should be on remedies that have a more potent
    effect in her healing.

    4. It is not in the Manual, so how could you have known. Although I did
    address it somewhere else on the forum.

    5. They resonate because it probably is in her system and is
    opportunistically creating symptoms. 
    But to really make a change, a more causal level has to be addressed.
    Lyme's is the result of a severely weakened system.
    Through trial and error and seeing lots of clients over the years of
    research Johan has found which order of treatment and which remedies are
    most effective... The bacteria, viruses and parasites are never the main
    problem, they are an expression of an unhealthy terrain. This doesn't mean
    that these remedies are not very important, but they should not be your
    main focus. 
    Focus should be on the organs that are most affected (teeth maybe? ;-)),
    and work from the Yang organs toward the Yin organs. Not everything at the
    same time or "all over the place" like Johan calls it. But make a good
    assessment on what is going on and then support according to that.

    6 & 7. OK good ;-) I think I've written that double now on point 2&3, but
    well for whomever needs it and arrives at this discussion I'll just leave
    it.

    8. No you didn't write "own remedies". I did, because these are not
    standard in the Chiren and are not the ones that come from Johan directly.
    Exchanging cards in class was always done (about 5), but not in the extreme
    numbers as in the US. 
    It was addressed in the Refresher that only very few of them are considered
    to be useful and others are not part of the standard set to work with. If
    you want to experiment with new remedies do it only one at the time. To
    really know if something works you first have to have the experience of
    working without them, just with the regular protocol. Then if you see how
    effective that is and gained experience with several clients with similar
    conditions, you can add one new remedy in certain conditions and see if
    that makes a positive difference. Before that you are not able to state
    that something is effective, because there are so many factors in play...

    Yes this is a good way to use it. If you use Geovita for diagnosing this
    can be really helpful. But again, not everything that resonates (although
    it does show it touches on a problem) is the remedy that is going to do the
    deep healing. Assessing geopathic stress is an important aspect of
    Biontology, just like assessing exposure to other disturbing fields is. If
    you know it is a problem, you can work on the environment of the client and
    that is often very much needed.

    When root canals are taken out a hole is left.... implants will create a
    new problem. This is why she is not going to do it... because she'll
    probably needs dentures then. Some people who take control of their own
    health and make this choice have some spectacular changes in health
    though...

    10. Hopefully you picked up from the comments that unfortunately it is not
    only about balancing drops. Sometimes remedies seem to correct things
    because they balance points, but then no result is seen. This is not only
    the case in therapy resistance.... It can be caused by the wrong sequence
    of treatment, the wrong assessment and focus, right remedies that are not
    potent enough (Johan tested many brands and Heel and Stauphen Pharma were
    superior in effect). So along with balancing the energetic system (drops),
    you should always be aware of the effect/results the treatment has. 

    I've seen with my own father how a bad mouth can ruin a life. I told him
    about the woman with 13 root canals. He said he used to have 11! I didn't
    know he had this many.... 
    Johan treated him in 2005, when he still had them without any effect. My
    fathers dentist was stubborn about getting his teeth out. One infection
    went up to his eyes a couple of years ago and destroyed his eye-sight. Now
    his response is very good to the Chiren, although he is so weak that he
    really has to come back from far... I don't know if it is possible at all
    (energy and activity are important for healing and he doesn't have that).
    Intuitively he was ready to pull all his teeth years ago, but the dentist
    wouldn't allow it. He told my father his teeth were still too good for
    this!

    Hi Everyone,

    2 weeks ago I went to a naturapathic doctor who is also a dentist. He has a
    device to check if you have galvanic current running from the metal in your
    mouth. I wanted to check this out because of all of our discussions in
    classes about metal in the mouth. I have a bridge,(10 years ago) one root
    canal,(20 years ago) one extracted tooth(10 years ago) and my 4 wisdom
    teeth ( extracted 30 years ago)
    The device registered that there is not a strong current from the bridge or
    the composite fillings in my mouth. All my amalgoms have been removed.
    However he registered that I probably have cavitations in 3 of my
    extraction sites(the root canal did not register as a big problem at this
    moment.) Then he looked at a panoramic xray from 2009. The xray showed to
    him 5 cavitations. He had me do another digital panoramic xray because he
    only detected 3. 2 of the 5 cavitations are gone! He doesn't see them on
    the xray I just did, and his device does not detect them. The only
    explanation I have is that the chiren helped my body get rid of the
    infections over the past year. I do not know what remedies were used on me
    when other practitioners treated me, but I have found and used keiferotosis
    on myself.
    I asked him how he treats cavitations. He does not open them up but injects
    them with homeopathic remedies 1x a week for 3 weeks. he also injects
    medical ozone into the sight. He also says to lay inverted(head below
    heart) at least 10 mins every day, to increase blood flow to the mouth, for
    the 3 weeks. He learned the technique in Germany. I asked him what remedies
    he uses. There are 5 remedies, procaine is one of them.

    Please remove my post if this is too much nonbiophoton info. The main point
    is I have clear evidence that the chiren helped me heal 2 cavitations and I
    am sure will help me with the other 3(which were bigger).

    Of course this has to do with Biontology. I hope we didn't scare you too
    much with the specific requests for posting on the forum ;-) 
   
    You write about a diagnostic tool that can more specifically register if
    there's a current running in the mouth. Very interesting to know about
    this.  

    And also the discovery and spontaneous healing of your cavitations... 
    Dental problems and solutions are very important to restoring ones optimal
    condition. It is wonderful to hear 2 of the cavitations were healed by your
    own immune system, these things take a long time... 3 are still there, but
    you're on the right track.

    Only the ozone and homeopathic injections wouldn't combine well with
    Biontology. Laying inverted I'm not sure about, I've heard that invertion
    stimulates endorphin production. So it must be stressful for the body...

    Thanks Karolina.  I also was not sure about the therapies he uses...    
    And I should of said at a slant rather than inverted, but that probably
    would cause endorphins too. That is good to know!

    This is very interesting, and I think instead of laying inverted we have
    the Chiren, and the possibility to put in circulations remedy  and do a
    local treatment :)

    Update 4/4:
    Client came today.
    Only had drops Large Intestine points of left hand.
    No Spin Inversion or Whiplash. After treatment, she texted that she feels
    much better.
    I suggested she goes to Upledger Institute, a highly regarded school/clinic
    that does craniosacral techniques. She has major structural damage to head
    and neck from everything. I think it could be helpful. Will see her again
    next two Thursdays for sure.

    Comments:
    1. I never use Footplates until all the drops are gone with the Standard
    Treatment.

    2. You wrote: "Whiplash and Spin Inversion are not a combination package.
    They are not to be used as a standard treatment."
    I never do Spin and Whiplash as a combo. I only use them if the drops
    indicate the client needs one and/or both of them. I have never used them
    as a standard treatment, but only if they balanced drops.

    3. You wrote: "Spin-Inversion is diagnosed when on the left hand all
    following 6 points drop steeply (energetically). Whiplash is diagnosed when
    both Parathyroid and Thyroid drop."
    Question: Do you mean we are not to use Spin Inversion unless ALL points
    drop on the two top points of the Triple Warmer, Heart, and Circulation -
    all at the same time? I did not learn that. I learned that if any of the
    top points drop on the Triple Warmer, Heart or Circulation, one does Spin
    Inversion first - before continuing. I want to get this straight in my
    mind.

    4. In "Correlations of Meridians, Points and Remedies" - Johan has Whiplash
    for Parathyroid, and then again for Thyroid. I thought this meant that IF
    either one of these drop, Whiplash is necessary. Do both have to be
    dropping to need Whiplash?
    It might be a good idea to write the exact procedure for the Spin and
    Whiplash - when one does both and when one does only one. I have this from
    classes directly taped recorded or saw on a video. Please correct if
    incorrect!

    5. Spin Inversion: When one of two points closest to the hand (top points)
    inTriple Warmer, or Circulation, or Heart - drops, treat with Spin
    Inversion. One can add supports (which we have listed many times).

    If the aura is gone - you get all drops - use Ozaliet.

    Whiplash: If there are drops on the Parathyroid or Thyroid, run Whiplash.

    Major note on Whiplash: Use Whiplash for anyone who has been sexually
    abused. Put the blue rod in front of the pubic bone across sideways, and
    put the other rod sideways on the 3rd Chakra (solar plexus) and run the
    light. Internal scars use Procrainum.

    Question: This was on a recording. I have not tried this, but will do it to
    myself to see how it works.

    6. You wrote: "Focus should be on the organs that are most affected, and
    work from the Yang organs toward the Yin organs. Not everything at the same
    time or "all over the place" like Johan calls it."
    I thought I did concentrate on the Yang organs: Small and Large Intestines,
    Bladder, Gallbladder, Stomach. However, I focused on all the Lyme's
    remedies too much, I see now. Thank you. That changed the way I treated her
    today.

    7. You wrote: "If you want to experiment with new remedies do it only one
    at the time."
    I meant that they were all taken from the "Own Remedies" on the Chiren. I
    tested the following remedies in clear glass vials first before I put them
    into the Chiren (all are from Pleo Sanum and because of the work I did with
    Dr. Reimar Banis and the REBA device a few years ago): Geovita for
    geopathic stress, Paravita for Adrenal fatigue, Simvita for high blood
    pressure. The others were from the cards I got in Walnut Creek.

    8. I don't believe that Geovita can 'heal' geopathic stress. I can use it
    to diagnose that a client has it, and a short 'shot' of it through the
    Chiren can be helpful. However, I must go to a home and/or office if a
    client continues to have Spin Inversion every week to rule out geopathic
    stress. Just moving someone's bed or where they sleep can cause a
    miraculous change in someone's health.

    9. You wrote: "When root canals are taken out a hole is left.... implants
    will create a new problem..."
    Whew! That really does seem extreme. That would also be very expensive for
    people in this country.

    10. You wrote: "Hope you picked up from the comments that unfortunately it

    Pharma were superior in effect). So along with balancing the energetic
    system (drops), you should always be aware of the effect/results the
    treatment has..."

    Question: I have pondered on this often, because there are so many nosodes
    and supports in the Chiren. One could probably find a number of them that
    would balance a drop. If the results are not great, they aren't working
    even if the body wanted them. I find that very interesting and wonder if
    there is something we are all missing who don't always get the same results
    as Johan. Is there a way that he knows if what he uses is going to work
    before waiting for the results during the three days of assimilation?

    11. Interesting about your father Karolina. My own mouth is not great
    either. I've managed to keep my teeth as an adult who made her own
    decisions, but when I was young they just yanked your teeth out if they
    weren't any good - many are missing. Now I think perhaps I was lucky -
    never thought that before!
    Question: I wasn't nursed by my mother, and had fake milk as a young child
    in Lima, Peru. Any thoughts about how to turn that around?

    Thank you for this fascinating round of Forum interaction. I've had several
    people write to me personally to comment on how it has helped them. I hope
    this continues to do so about Spin Inversion and Whiplash (perhaps this
    part needs to be moved to that category?)... I know it must be extremely
    difficult to do that. This post has taken on a number of different
    categories!
    Thank you again.

    1. Why not? Sometimes not everything is balanced after the Hand Treatment,
    and then you can measure again and put the remedies you need on the
    Footplates.

    2. OK good! I misunderstood that you used them standard together.

    3. Yes all 6 points need to drop sharply to diagnose Spin Inversion. The
    Pituitary and Para-Thyroid almost always drop in the first treatment
    because of the vaccinations, so the way you describe you would diagnose
    Spin Inversion in almost everybody the first treatment.

    4. If there's Whiplash there's an energetic disturbance in both Thyroid and
    Para-Thyroid, since the whole throat area is affected. So yes, both have to
    drop! This is described in the step by step protocol.

    Johan might have said in class that he only uses the Thyroid point to
    diagnose Whiplash, but the reason for this is that in the first treatment
    in his experience the Para-Thyroid always drops because of the Tetanus
    vaccination.

    5. Where did you get that? This is what is in the measurement protocol:

    " Measure the upper two (proximal) points of the hormonal system on the
    left hand (pituitary and para-thyroid gland)
    When these points are making sharp –energetic- drops you continue to
    measure the upper two (proximal) points of the heart and the upper two
    (proximal) points of the circulation on the left hand. If these points too
    drop steeply it shows the client has a spin-inversion and this should be
    corrected first."

    So I thought this would make clear that all points need to drop.

    6. Yes, you did focus on correcting the drops on these organs, but I didn't
    see that you focussed your support on these. 
    I also sometimes make general remarks because many people will read your
    discussion and I wrote this to show what should be the focus instead of the
    diagnosis of Lyme's. I always try to be as clear as possible, since every
    answer can create new questions..

    7. I meant that no matter how you got these remedies, they're not part of
    the standard package and even if they correct drops that doesn't
    necessarily mean that they have the quality to heal. They need to be tested
    for their effect/potency in healing. This can only be done one by one and
    with the background of experience with the normal procedures, remedies and
    the specific condition of your client.

    8. Yes, I thought that is what I wrote. If it helps you to diagnose
    geopathic stress, this is a very useful remedy for that specific reason. I
    didn't believe you would use it to heal the stress without addressing the
    living environment.

    9. I think you mean the pulling of teeth here? Is pulling teeth expensive
    in the US? In the Netherlands I believe it is the cheapest solution. Root
    canals and implants are really unaffordable, especially if you need so
    many...
    And yes it is a drastic procedure... I would never push something like that
    onto someone.
    It is a good sign that your client is now responding positively, so maybe
    healing of her mouth is still possible, it might be though that she'll
    never be "ready", since the teeth can also continue to disturb the body...

    10. Yes this was a very important realisation for me too! Balancing points
    doesn't always mean that the therapy is working. You can only observe that
    after the treatment.
    Johan has so many years of experience and because of this knows which
    remedies are most effective (he tested many homeopathic brands), but even
    then sometimes he finds something that resonated that didn't solve the
    problem. He then continues to try something else and doesn't stick with the
    things that did not work.
    Sometimes a remedy can be needed more often (especially ulcerations,
    stones, inflammations, cirrhosis), but something has to change for the
    client after the session... Putting the right supports in to help the
    affected organ to heal, after you found the nosode that balanced it, is
    also very important.

    11. That is interesting... maybe you can make that into a new discussion,
    since this one is about yourself and not about the client of this case you
    presented. 

    I can split discussions, but not a message and when there are so many
    comments directed at the main discussion and then a part of it should be in
    another section, my hands are tied to do anything about it to make it more
    organised...

    I agree, this is a very good discussion since you gave so much detailed
    information. Thank you so much for that. I think we've both spend some
    hours on it, but it is very educational!

    Thank you AGAIN. I realize we have to end at some point, but sometimes
    language can get in the way of understanding properly - especially when one
    is not together with the ability to understand immediately. I think that
    did happen here a few times, and it's even possible that many people
    misunderstood about the Spin and Whiplash. I am curious to know if anyone
    else misunderstood. Perhaps one could write in the existing category about
    these treatments?

    1. "Sometimes not everything is balanced after the Hand Treatment, and then
    you can measure again and put the remedies you need on the Footplates." 
    I am happy to read this. Johan said this recently, but I thought he added
    that the best is to get all drops gone before you put someone on the
    footplates. This Forum is GREAT for dealing with details that make our work
    so much better!

    3. "All 6 points need to drop sharply to diagnose Spin Inversion. The
    Pituitary and Parathyroid almost always drop in the first treatment because
    of vaccinations, so the way you describe you would diagnose Spin Inversion
    in almost everybody the first treatment."
    Yes. When I have measured the 6 points and I found ONE drop in any of them,
    I thought I was to run the Spin Inversion. Is it possible to Spin someone
    counter-clockwise if they didn't need a Spin Inversion? This will change
    what I am doing, so I am thrilled to know these facts. Obviously, I have
    never understood it properly, and as I wrote above - I wonder if anyone
    else has misunderstood this?

    4. "If there's Whiplash there's an energetic disturbance in both Thyroid
    and Parathyroid, since the whole throat area is affected. So yes, both have
    to drop! This is described in the step by step protocol." 
    Am I missing some important piece? What step-by-step protocol? I have the
    Correlations of Meridians, Points and Remedies, which we received recently.
    But there is nothing there that shows we are to only do the Whiplash if
    BOTH the Thyroid and Parathyroid drop. They are listed separately, as if we
    should do Whiplash if EITHER one drops.

    "Johan might have said in class that he only uses the Thyroid point to
    diagnose Whiplash, but the reason for this is that in the first treatment
    in his experience the Para-Thyroid always drops because of the Tetanus
    vaccination."
    Maybe that is where I got that and didn't get the other end of it... Thank
    you.

    5. "Where did you get that? ... measurement protocol"
    I get it now, but what I wrote in my last comment was taken directly from a
    class that I tape recorded and input into my computer. I think it came from
    the Block 1 courses tape recorded with W in Canada. I tape recorded the
    entire week with her. Again, this clears it all up for me, and it will
    completely change the way I start out with the Spin and Whiplash now. This
    is a biggie for me.

    6. "...but I didn't see that you focused your support on these." 
    You are right. I didn't give enough supports, although the 5th time (where
    I forgot to add what I actually did - sorry about that) I did give her a
    lot more supports...and that is when she finally responded. So, the
    interesting part of this is that the supports are what helped the detox and
    that is when she finally had major detox symptoms!

    Just for your information: My treatments with this woman have been quite
    different from anyone else, mainly because she was so all over the place
    with hundreds of "medical terminology" symptoms, and I felt a bit
    overwhelmed by her negativity about herself. She clearly 'identifies'
    herself as these symptoms. This is 'her story' in life. I find it
    disconcerting, because no matter how positive and nurturing one is, the
    response is, "But..." ... I call these the "But People"!

    7. Again, thank you for the clarification. Triple Virgo and Trip
    Sagittarius communicating is quite interesting! hahaha...

    8. "If it helps you to diagnose geopathic stress, this is a very useful
    remedy for that specific reason. I didn't believe you would use it to heal
    the stress without addressing the living environment."
    I totally agree, and I did understand that. I just wanted to make sure you
    understood what I wrote, because it sounded to me like I didn't know that
    when I re-read my words.

    9. "Is pulling teeth expensive in the US? Root canals and implants are
    really unaffordable, especially if you need so many."
    Thank goodness, right? Better to not have so many! They are expensive here,
    too. Just going to a dentist in America is very expensive. Pulling teeth
    usually requires being knocked out and that adds to the expense. And most
    dentists today won't just pull all the teeth (like they did several of mine
    when I was young - before root canals became the 'fad' in this country.

    "It is a good sign that your client is now responding positively, so maybe
    healing of her mouth is still possible, it might be though that she'll
    never be "ready", since the teeth can also continue to disturb the
    body..." 
    Unfortunately, she felt great until 1am and then she texted me to let me
    know she was dizzy again. I'm looking forward to the cranio-sacral work she
    will get, because I think that might help her. You can imagine how much
    structural damage has occurred with so much work inside of her head ...not
    to mention all the numbing medications.

    "Balancing points doesn't always mean that the therapy is working. You can
    only observe that after the treatment. Sometimes a remedy can be needed
    more often (especially ulcerations, stones, inflammations, cirrhosis), but
    something has to change for the client after the session... Putting the
    right supports in to help the affected organ to heal, after you found the
    nosode that balanced it, is also very important."
    Thank you.

    11. "...maybe you can make that into a new discussion, since this one is
    about yourself and not about the client"
    I will do that. It would be interesting to find out if anyone comes up with
    something for that! Now I think we have spent all the time we can on this
    one! However, I will do updates to let everyone know how it turns out for
    this client. She might decide to stick with her self-identity of being a
    helpless person and going to everyone she can to try to heal her (therapy
    hopper I think is what Sophie called it). On the other hand, she does
    continue to try and she is going to continue, even feeling lousy!
   
    Thank you for this entire sharing experience. I do much better when I have
    things very concrete in my mind with details ... as you know from being a
    great astrologer, too.

    3. No not possible to Spin someone counterclockwise with the normal Spin
    Inversion program. The only thing that will happen when you do a Spin
    Inversion Treatment when there's no actual Spin Inversion is to give the
    electrons an extra push in the right direction and support blood, liver and
    heart by the treatment with own blood. This can never harm, but if you do
    it standard before the measurement of remedies you might lose information
    like in all preparation programs.
   
    4. The pages you're writing about are an update to the complete measurement
    protocol that was sent around some months ago. Did you not receive that? 
   
    5. The course in Canada was organized by someone else than Johan and the
    course was not monitored by him. Also W was never guided in education by
    Johan, so she has similar misunderstandings as other therapists have. This
    is why Johan's involvement right now to explain things more detailed is so
    needed... I'm personally very grateful for this, it is a huge effort for
    him on top of everything that needs to happen within the organization.
   
    6. Yes, support remedies are supporting the organs to do what they need to
    do in order to heal from the condition that is indicated by the measured
    nosode. Sometimes this means that they help initiate detoxification. 
   
    Many chronically ill people are just so desperate that they try to find out
    any way they can what is wrong with them. They collect a lot of information
    this way and sometimes that's hard to let go of because therapists and
    doctors can be so convincing. 
    Giving people trust by radiating confidence in what you do, but also
    understanding where they come from can be helpful. Johan usually just says
    "let go of everything" and if there's a reason why letting go is so
    difficult you can talk about that.
   
    7. Professionally I'm very much Virgo with my MC in this sign, can't you
    tell? ;-)
   
    9. Oh... not good. Falling back that quickly might mean the body is not
    able to win this battle... Maybe apart from the root canals causing chronic
    infections/abscesses there's also an electrical current running because of
    the metal implants. Sometimes this can cause Spin Inversion. 
    I wonder if cranio sacral work can do something for her as long as the
    cause is still there in her mouth.

    But feeling good at first and then going into detox/healing is also a
    possibility of what has happened. Since only the last two treatments you
    have focussed on her teeth, it might be to soon to tell if the treatment is
    going to work for her or not...
   
    One more comment I overlooked in the discussion above: 
    "Major note on Whiplash: Use Whiplash for anyone who has been sexually
    abused. Put the blue rod in front of the pubic bone across sideways, and
    put the other rod sideways on the 3rd Chakra (solar plexus) and run the
    light."
    There's no standard for abuse. If something like that was needed you first
    should find energetic (sharp) drops on the organs in between this scar
    treatment area that you can't solve in any other way. But I've never seen
    this and neither has Johan. This is obviously an idea that came from
    thinking and not from objectively observing and measuring. 
    When you do find steep drops you can't correct, there's of course nothing
    wrong with this way of treating... When you don't find these kind of drops
    and do it as a standard procedure, you can lose valuable information.

    Thank you again.

    #3: Great with the details about Spin.

    #4: "update to the complete measurement protocol that was sent around some
    months ago" Hmmm... What is the title of that? I don't think I ever
    received it. It probably was around the same time I ran into such huge
    problems with my computer and lost ALL of my emails.

    #5: I had no idea. It's amazing that Paul was ever involved with Johan.
    Such different people.

    #6: Yes, I always knew that. I think Johan was very adamant about how
    important support is for the organs. This is my first case in 15 months
    with anyone who had this acute response. I am going to give her more
    supports again on Thursday.

    (MC in Virgo! You can relate to me. Imagine having Uranus EXACT conjunction
    M.C. in Gemini!) The Chiren is perfect for me,

    #9: She is texting me often about how she feels. I am hoping that since the
    mouth has only REALLY been treated twice now, the next two treatments will
    help her more. If they don't, I doubt if we will continue.

    I tend to never have a problem at all with people trusting me. That is
    probably one of my strongest traits. I know how to relax people and help
    them to open up, thank goodness.

    Regarding the "Major note on Whiplash" ... That was
    something I thought Johan told us in a class recently. At the time, I
    wanted to ask more about it - but there were other discussions and then I
    forgot. If Johan didn't tell us that, then who was it? Does he know?

    Thank you.

    You did it! Much nicer text this way and I don't have to edit. Thank you!

    #4 I'll try to find the old mail in my inbox and forward it to you since
    you probably lost it completely and maybe other information that was in
    there too. 

    #6 That's what this forum is about. The interesting and hard cases. Usually
    there's more to learn there.. (Pluto in 10 ;-))

    #9 I think this is exactly what you should do. If the next 2 treatments
    don't give any improvement, you'll know that something else is needed for
    her. Most likely a holistic dentist.  

    Yes I know that. But with "therapy hoppers" (I do hate that judgement
    although I know it was talked about in class) it is a lack of faith in
    general that they have, it is usually not even related to the therapist.
    This can have different causes, but in my view the lack of faith is a
    symptom/cause itself... an expression of the overall pathology and not
    something a person can easily control. There is much fear involved and when
    there's fear, one gets narrow in his/her mind. Survival feelings come up. 

    Another thing is that all clients have more or less a victim mentality
    otherwise they wouldn't try to find help outside. But that is because they
    are a victim! Something has happened to them that was out of their
    conscious control that threw their balance of and created disease.

    Even if lifestyle, mental/emotional attitude or other choices, are the
    cause of an illness, this is something that a client was not completely
    conscious of at the time the disease evolved. If they would have known, and
    with that I mean, if they would have completely consciously been aware of
    what consequences would be, different choices would have been made.

    Biontology (and I believe all true healing) is all about helping a client
    to get balanced again, but also to raise consciousness, so he/she will make
    better choices in the future.

    I asked Johan about the standard "belly-whiplash" and he doesn't know where
    it comes from. If it was taught as a major thing that should be done every
    time, it doesn't come from him. But maybe it came up in class through
    someone else and was not picked up by him...?

September 2015 - Appendicitis, Plantets, Radiation, Pesticides

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
September 2015 edited September 2015 in Q&A Flag
Questions

1. What is the function of the Appendix when it is in a state of full health?
If the Appendix is removed, are these functions lost or is the body able to
compensate?

2. Please speak on the correspondences you have discovered between the hormonal
glands and the planets.

3. Is it possible that the radiation from air travel might cause polyps that
are non cancerous to increase in size and/or become cancerous?

4. I live in an area where there is heavy pesticide use, which is constantly
affecting my Stomach, and Thyroid. I have to clear myself every several weeks.
I am definately going to move from this area. But wonder if I will encounter
this same trouble somewhere else.

My question - will the body eventually get to a point of healing where the
immune system will be able to handle toxins such as this on its own?

Answers

1. The exact function of the Appendix is medically unknown. That is why they
easily remove it. 
Because the Appendix contains mainly lymphatic tissue, I believe it has a
defensive function just like the Tonsils have. When there is an overload of
pathological bacteria or when the recognition system does not work the Appendix
may become chronically infected.
At the moment there is also a theory that the Appendix is the place where the
body stores healthy gut flora to repopulate the intestines after a severe
infection or diarrhoea. 
There is a lot of lymphatic tissue throughout the intestines, but I don't think
the body can fully compensate for the removal. 

2. I am not an astrologer, but I found that astrology done by a skilled person
can be very accurate. The influences of the planets seem to get into the
physical body at conception. I tried to explain this and came up with a broad
theory when investigating the process of conception.

The theory is as follows:
* Children (soul) can be seen in the aura of the parents long before conception
takes place, sometimes even during puberty of the parents
* Conception only takes place when sperm and eggs physically come together,
even though the DNA of just the man or the woman has all the facilities to
reproduce on its own
* The body is like a radio, in that it sends and receives
* The female aspect (egg) is specialised in receiving
* The male aspect (sperm) is specialised in sending
* The soul contains information/instructions that need to be translated into
the physical
* When sperm and egg come together they have the capability to carry out these
instructions
* Parents are thus "facilitators" and "caretakers" of the light that we are
* Everything moves in spirals whereby the physical manifestation takes place at
the end of the vortex 
* The length of this specific spiral that leads to human manifestation is about
9 months, starting with a broad diameter and ending in the single point
* During the 9 months when the "wind" moves towards the single point it moves
through the planetary atmospheres and picks up various information which then
manifests. 
* The sun is the start of the vortex and plays an important role at the end of
the vortex. The sun sign in astrology is therefore of great importance.
* I have no idea as yet which planet represents which hormonal gland. The sun
however seems to represent the Pineal gland.

3. The radiation that one is exposed to during air travel is definitely causing
Tumors to grow. In the body the Thyroid, which is responsible for cell growth,
is particularly sensitive to radiation. When there is already something wrong
with the Thyroid it may react to radiation easily, causing polyps or malignant
tumors (immediately or delayed) to grow.
Due to the effects of the radiation, there is perhaps excessive stimulation of
the Thyroid gland or radiation may give information to the gland which leads to
wrong actions. 

4. Pesticides are always a problem for the body. If you are in an area where
there is heavy pesticide use, there are always pesticides in the air. You
inhale them and this leads often to a disturbance of the Pineal and Pituitary
glands. These glands are the master glands of the body and are responsible for
the regeneration and the whole response and discrimination system.
If this happens on a regular basis, the body has no time to heal.
I think you need to be outside such an area for an extended period of time to
allow your body to get stronger.
During this time, your digestive system should also be freed of pesticides, so
everything you eat should be organic. That way your system has at least a
chance to recover.

Theoretically your body should be in balance once your recognition system is
clean and stays clean. However, health is a process and not a condition. So a
healthy condition is always followed by a diseased condition. The body needs to
learn to fight this negative condition by itself. Only in such a way will your
own system become stronger.

If you can ever live healthily with your current environmental circumstances I
can not tell. It depends on the toxic load that you are exposed to and to your
individual capabilities to detoxify your body of these influences. You can only
assist your body to do the best it can.

Swelling Abdomen and Legs after "Tummy Tuck" (cosmetic surgery)

TorilJelterTorilJelter
January 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
Mother, with swelling of the abdomen and legs after cosmetic surgery 6 moths
ago. 

1st session 
Measurement, drops on:
Bladder (left), 
Kidney (left) 
Gallbladder (left)
Gallbladder (right)
Bladder (1 near foot) 

Treatment:
After scar program of long horizontal scar of lower abdomen no drops hands or
feet 
Finished with dyslexia program with Cerebrum, Viscum and Thalamus 

2nd Session
1 week later-(she couldn't do the 4 day interval) 
Scar has improved and swelling is improving some (she has also started
lymphedema therapy) 

Measurement
No drops, I suspect Endorphin Mask. 

Treatment
I decided to treat the Scars again now with Electrodes last time with Glass
Rods because she is interested in both Physical and Energetic improvements.
Didn't get to recheck after as she had to leave early...

Finished with footplates and Cerebrum, Viscum, Thalamus 

3rd Session (2 week interval) 
Lost 4 lbs probably mostly fluid she thinks. Abdomen and legs slimmer. 
Now she also tells me that around the 1st visit she started getting severe
cramping and menstrual bleeding. Her doctor is recommending removal of her
Uterus. 

Measurement
Endorphin Mask, which clears with Viscum, Plumbum and Atropinum. 

Veins (left) 
Nervous System (left)
Large Intestine (right) 
Circulation (right) - 2 points closest to hand 
Veins (right) - 2 points closest to hand 
Organ Degeneration (right) - 1 point from hand  
Heart - 4 points

No drops on feet 

All drops resolve with Cholesterinum (I added Atropinum for support) 
Kidneys OK Balanced after standard >12 program. 

Did a few Bush & Bach. 
Footplates: Viscum, Thalamus, Cerebrum 

Now here is my concern: 
If she has her uterus removed she will get new problems and maybe the bleeding
is part of a long overdue healing process? 
I can't really advise against her doctor but do you think that her overall
health would be better if she waited 2-3 months with surgery to see how far
Biophoton Therapy will take her and then reconsider surgery if not adequately
satisfied? I suspect she will get surgery because the bleeding is so severe and
the doctor found a problem. I don't think she is anemic yet. 
Have you had a similar case? 

She is away this week but will return next week so I can give an update after
that. Input welcome or feedback on anything I could do better Toril

    I doubt very much that the Gallbladder is in good order. If it is really
    menstrual bleeding, then always the Gallbladder is involved. I suggest
    continued treatment with Gallbladder problems and remedies, like Biliary
    Cirrhosis and Cholecystitis, Chelidoniium, Atropinum, Berberis, and
    Injeel-Chol. Also treat with Barijodeel and Hamamelis, Apis for fluid
    retention. The cause of the Gallbladder problems might be other infections
    in Liver, Colon.
    So I suggest she abstains from surgery until you have had time to solve the
    cause. She can of course have the surgery but then the symptom(warning
    sign) is gone and the causes are still there

    Hi Toril, in America like elsewhere we cannot advice but we can talk to the
    clients of their options. It is always their choice to do surgery but I
    beleive it is easier for her to delay it and see what happens after she has
    had a good talk with you and seen for herself that Chiren work might avoid
    the surgery. Still her choise. 

    I beleive you are right with the high endorphins masking the true nature of
    her body. Keep measuring her and report back how it goes.  Good luck and I
    look forward to hear how it is going with her.

    I read through your treatment-notes again and I would like to comment to
    "dig" in to the drops with a nosode next time that could clear all the
    drops or high endorphins. If she has a liver /gallbladder issue it might
    cause everything to be under stress. and the surgery she did 6 months ago,
    did they cut or just suck? cuts through the stomac area can be deep and
    stressfull to the body and even without that surgery, many people now adays
    have a gallbladder issue as of will power, so what does selenium and
    berberis do to her adrenal glands if they are dropping? or if you have
    gallbladder drops?

    Thank-you Johan and Nora, 

    Nora, Client has an incision across her lower abdomen from side to side.
    She did not get stomach surgery or liposuction but some adjustment of
    anterior abdominal wall muscles was done to 'tighten' things up after
    multiple babies and a tightening of the skin like a face lift of the
    abdomen.
   
    I will explore your suggestions and get back to you next week.

    Focus of Client:
    Wants lymphedema to decrease, abdominal discomfort to subside. Wants scars
    to look/feel better.

    Symptoms:
    Lymphedema of lower legs - got worse as expected but no more bleeding...
    Had tummy tuck last year and breast enlargement several years ago.
    Abdominal discomfort (bloating/discomfort especially with gluten, sometimes
    unrelated to eating as well), 
    Client also has Heartburn off and on and stopped her calcium channel
    blocker.
    Pain below right rib (muscle and/or gallbladder?) after tummy tuck,
    Hands turn white in cool weather started in feet last year,
    On thyroid medication for years,
    Tends to be constipated.

    Abbreviated Summary (Can't recall all details will try to post weekly til
    done.)

    1st Session
    Post Hysterectomy (uterus and fallopian tubes removed)

    Measurement:
    All drops -> Spin-Inversion Treatment -> no Spin Inversion anymore

    >12 Years Program:
    Brucella Abortus Bang (corrected many drops), Lymphomyosot, Mucosa as
    support
    Footplates:
    Gall Bladder remedies, Atropinum etc. Kidney meridians OK Balanced at end?

    2nd Session

    Scar Treatment with electrodes & later glass rods. (Should have done this
    earlier but needed private room).

    Breasts, 4 small scars on abdomen, 
    Vertical/ horizontal/back and front with Procrainum over Uterine area


    3rd Session

    Feels "off" No definite change 
    Spin Inversion Treatment with fresh blood - resolves

    >12 years Program 
    Myom Uteri, Ulcus Ventriculi, Anacardium, Veratrum, Nux Vomica, Mucosa

    Most drops resolved.

    Footplate Treatment:
    Selenium, Berberis, Ozaliet, Electro essence, Causticum, Tonico, Circulo,
    Space Clearing (this was before Johan said don't use Bush and Bach in first
    couple of treatments)

    4th Session

    Sleeps very well after treatments, otherwise no definite change

    Measurement:

    Small Intestine (left) - 4 points closest to hand

    Footplates:
    Solidago, Reneel, Populus, Mucosa, Nux Vomica, Hepar, Aesculus,
    Lymphomyosot

    Kidney meridians OK

    Measurement: one Gallbladder drop on right and 1 Liver drop resolves on
    left with formaldehyde

    5th Session

    No Spin Inversion again YAY!

    Measurement:
    Small Intestines (left) - All points

    Footplate Treatment: 
    Anginheel, Mucosa, Nux Vomica, Lymphomyosot, Chelidonium, Atropinum,
    Selenium, Circulo

    Kidney meridian OK All balanced at end.

    I reviewed the feedback above will consider more Gallbladder remedies i.e.
    Biliary cirrhose, Cholecystitis, Injeel-Chol.

    For fluid retention I need to add Barijodeel, Hamamelis, Apis

    Questions:
    1. Seems odd it took so many sessions for Appendicitis to match. 
    2. Client wants to go running so I'm not overly optimistic that the
    Lymphedema of the legs will magically disappear with so much surgery 
    3. Has anyone had a similar case that got better at least the Lymphedema
    (Swelling of legs) ? Any gross oversights given this limited information?

    Thanks!

    You use far too many support remedies and not enough nosodes.

    Symptoms: 
    Client has heartburn: you should find the cause and not just treat with
    support. Like you wrote, consider Gallbladder remedies. Try Calculi Bil &
    Renales, Cholecystitis, Biliary Cirrhosis, any or all of them, it all
    depends on what matches.

    Lymphedema: The cause of this is Bad Circulation, especially bad Veins. Try
    if one or more of the following remedies match: Barijodeel (indicates
    calcification), Hamamelis (indicates bad valves in the veins), Belladonna
    or Chelidonium (indicates infection), Atropinum (indicates cramping in the
    veins) and Apis.
    Also use Lymphomyosot as support for the Lymphatic Vessels. 
    Adrenal Exhaustion might be another cause.

    If Appendicitis matches, you need to check Chronic appendicitis and
    Appendicitis Necroticans. Especially since all points on Small Intestine
    (left) dropped. There is a good chance that these Appendicitis nosodes
    would match also on the Small Intestines.

    Constipation is also a result of missing Intestinal Flora, a result of
    Appendicitis. But the Intestines first need to get rid of their Infection,
    before using the Intestinal Bacteria.

    TorilJelterTorilJelter
    March 2013 edited March 2013 Flag
    I thought minimum number of nosodes for maximum effect. I used few nosodes
    because I measured that everything was balanced with those nosodes. I'm
    sure I checked Chronic Appendicitis and Appendicitis Necroticans I always
    do. I am trying to find the cause with everyone. 

    If Gallbladder remedies don't match or if I find something else that
    matches according to protocoll before I get to the Gallbladder remedies I
    use that because it matches but now I see in another post you want me to
    try Gallbladder remedies even if they don't match if a person has
    Heartburn, seems stressed and the Gallbladder point is not dropping. Then
    I'm not looking for a match?

    Lymphedema: Don't you think part of this is caused by the 4 surgeries? I
    have treated the scars and yes it makes sense that improving circulation
    will improve lymphedema but can a person with so many scars/ surgeries be
    expected to improve 100% or 50% in terms of the Lymphedema? Has anyone had
    a similar case? How did it go?

    Yes I will definitely check the Intestinal Flora once Appendicitis has
    cleared. This may help her constipation.'

    Thanks from Toril

    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    March 2013 edited January 2014 Flag
    Yes, you are right. You should try to find a minimum number of nosodes for
    a maximum effect, but you can also do too little. For example I miss
    Poliomyelitis in your series of treatments. This is very uncommon not to
    appear when someone is vaccinated... 
    Also nosodes are very powerful/effective and can be used according to
    symptoms too if you only need very little nosodes to get the points
    balanced. They are used in a more supportive way then. Just don't overdo
    it.

    Also, when you only find few Nosodes, then you should not compensate with
    Support remedies in empty slots. There should be a balance between Nosodes
    and Support remedies. It is better to leave some spots open.

    Measuring is always what you should do to find the remedies that match, but
    if what you measure doesn't match the symptoms, you look at these symptoms
    and deduct what might be the cause and what remedies can help with this. 
    If you don't measure Gallbladder drops, but you know there are symptoms
    that are clearly related to Gallbladder imbalance you can try to match
    Gallbladder remedies on other organ systems. For example when you measure
    Small Intestine drops, you can put Gallbladder remedies in the slots to
    determine whether they correct those drops. This way, by cross-measuring,
    you can find underlying causes for a problem.

    The first cause of the Lymphedema is likely to be the surgeries. 
    But then the question is: which organ systems were affected to cause the
    Lymphedema directly? And the answer to this is the Circulation, Veins and
    Lymphatic System. It is blockage, damage, pressure and/or inflammation in
    these systems that leads to edema. So this is where your focus should be to
    correct it. 

    I've seen very good results with different types and causes of edema, also
    after surgery. 

    Did you also treat the internal scars with Procrainum?

    Do you use procranium in the slots and run scar treatment with the pads or
    the glads rods?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    March 2013 edited January 2014 Flag
    The electrical current from the pads will not penetrate as deeply as the
    light treatment will. So although scar treatment with the pads will be more
    effective if the scars are on the skin surface, for internal scars it is
    better to treat with the glass rods.

    Procranium can be used either in the Standard treatment or in the Scar
    treatment (with Glass Rods), but count it as an extra Remedy.

    Karolina, Yes I did do scar treatment with glass rods with psorinum in slot
    over uterus area horizontal, vertical and back to front. Yesterday I got
    one drop on the Gallbladder. I am beginning to understand moving beyond
    matching although matching is critical and most important as a beginner. 
    I will concentrate more on the symptoms if measurements don't fit and visit
    the Gallbladder remedies more frequently. Today I noticed another client
    whose Gallbladder points didn't drop until I had several matches for other
    things in the slot which makes me better understand what Carol was talking
    about with my other Heartburn client. 
    THANKS! Trying to move on to some synthesis thinking. I have also asked
    client to do Lymphedema measurements of her legs and abdomen. How long did
    your cases take to improve? This person would like to be all better very
    quickly. Toril

    session 6

    Symptoms: 
    Lymphedema after multiple surgeries of lower body.
    Mild heartburn-improving? 
    Mild cold 2 days.
    Other digestive issues described above. Sleeps better for 2 nights after
    Biophoton sessions otherwise she's not sure sessions are making a
    difference. I have asked her to measure legs and abdomen to monitor
    progress.

    Measurement:
    Small Intestine (R) - 3 distal drop
    Heart (R) - 2nd from nail drops
    Gallbladder (R) - 4th from nail 
    Liver (L) - 3rd from nail

    Hand Treatment: 
    Chronic Tonsillitis, Tonsillitis, Tonsilla Comp (Small Intestine) , Strep.
    Heamolytica (Heart), Formaldehyde (Liver) 
    All was balanced, but in retrospect I think I should have put in more
    Gallbladder nosodes. Don't recall which one resolved the Gallbladder drop.

    Question: 
    What would the experts have done differently?

    Footplate Treatment: 
    Anginheel, Hepar, Hepeel, Belladonna, Lymphomyosot, Barijodeel, Aurumheel

    Questions: 
    Should I not put in more support than nosodes?

    Next time I will emphasize Gallbladder remedies and support for Circulation
    /Veins and see if Poliomyelitis matches and if it doesn't I will put it in
    anyways?

    I think I am measuring OK.

    I do not think that the surgeries have caused the Lymphedema directly, but
    maybe the stress of the surgery did.
    Cramping (Gallbladder) could close off (whole or partially) the Lymphatic
    Vessels too. So, based on these symptoms and the measured drops on Liver
    and Gallbladder, I would have gone for the Gallbladder.

    If she has been vaccinated for Polio put Poliomyelitis in anyway. It always
    shows up, so it is curious that it doesn't with her. So I would treat it.

    When I worked in the hospital to administer radiotherapy to women with
    breast cancer, often the result of a mastectomy was Lymphedema. So surgery
    can definitely lead to this condition in my experience.

    Maybe it is also the scars that are still physically there, even though
    energetically they are solved (no more steep drops). 
    Are you treating the Scars every time or only just once? 
    Physical scars take more time to heal. If she lives near you she might want
    to come more frequently, just for the scar treatment. Or when this is not
    possible she can use a ChiKey with a Procrainum (and maybe Atropinum
    considering Johan's suggestion that cramping might be the problem) card to
    do the Scar Treatment herself every day.

    OK Good ideas. More frequent scar treatments. I only did two scar sessions.
    Maybe she needs more. YES that makes sense. I'll definitely put in Polio
    next time.

    Session 7 (final session for now)

    Symptoms: 
    Heartburn improved. Discomfort under right rib a lot better (Gallbladder?)
    Had this discomfort for a year before sessions. Receiving physical therapy
    for Lymphedema 1-2 times a week and trying to shift to a less intense
    exercise program to limit Lymphedema. Used to be a runner.

    Measurements
    Small Intestine (L - 2 drops only!) - Poliomyelitis, Chronic appendicitis,
    Appendicitis
    Rest is OK

    Footplates: 
    Barijodeel, Aurumheel, Injeel Chol, Atropinum, Hamamelis, Syzygium,
    Circulo, Selenium

    Because her Biophoton measurements seem so good today and she is doing
    physical therapy and I am treating elsewhere for a while. 
    I suggested she call me in 2-3 months if she is not satisfied with the
    progress she is making in terms of the Lymphedema decreasing.

    In retrospect I probably should have continued til the Appendicitis
    disappears. I explained we may need to do more frequent Scar Treatments as
    you had mentioned.

    Any other suggestions?

    Did you measure Chronic Appendicitis but not Chronic Tonsilitis? They are
    often both infected at the same time. Can only one of them be infected?
  • 
    TorilJelterTorilJelter
    April 2013 edited April 2013 Flag
    Question: If Chronic Appendicitis and Appendicitis balance all drops on
    Intestine should one routinely also check Chronic Tonsillitis after
    removing Chronic Appendicitis and Appendicitis from slots to see if Chronic
    Tonsillitis balances Intestine drops and more than Chronic Appendicitis and
    Appendicitis? 

    In the interest of getting faster I may not have done that since I needed
    so few nosodes to balance everything anyways. What would the experts
    recommend here? 

    I do think you can have Chronic Appendicitis without Chronic Tonsillitis.
    Because of a remark from Johan if I find Chronic Appendicitis matches I
    always put in Appendicitis to avoid an acute Appendicitis situation.

    April 2013 edited April 2013 Flag
    We have seen chronic appendicitis often returning if we do not treat the
    Chronic Tonsillitis. Chronic tonsilltis and Appendicitis can affect the
    whole body.

    If I find Appendicitis Necroticans, I do not put the other Appedicitis
    nosodes in. However, when I find Chronic Appendicitis, I do put
    Appendicitis in to avoid it becoming acute. When the Necrotizing Appendix
    is treated, it normally goes back to Chronic after one or more treatments.

    It can take a couple of minutes after you take a remedy out that was
    effective, before points start to drop again. So this is not a very
    practical suggestion.

    When a remedy is effective you leave it in. The Chronic Tonsillitis and
    Tonsillitis nosodes are usually measured on the Tonsil points of the
    Lymphatic System meridian, which are usually not corrected by the
    Appendicitis nosodes. So again removing these nosodes from the slots before
    measuring for Tonsillitis is not necessary.

Notes and Neutralization

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
February 2013 edited February 2013 in Biontology Insights Flag
Notes

After observing and testing the use of notes for almost 8 years I have to make
the following conclusion: The use of notes in treatment is questionable.
The use of notes for physical drugs or other chemicals is something I gave up
very soon after I started experimenting with them, since they don’t cause any
change at all.
The only thing I continued to use the notes for was for perceived emotional
issues or for suspected entities in a client’s energy field.

In the use of notes for emotional issues, they might have a result but not
because of the note (alone) but because you create consciousness around an
issue. The talking about it and the client expressing it brings it to the
surface. This is far more effective then the intention in the note.

Even with these emotional/energetic things one has to question the reason for
the problem. If you for example want to neutralize a relative, you need to
assess what it is with this relative that a client has a problem with. Then
that issue needs to be taken care of, not the name of the relative itself. It
is never the relative who is the problem, although the client might think this
is the case. The real issue is always what this person does or does not do, in
other words their actions or non-actions that are troubling to the client.
But even if you have found this answer, you also need to find out why this or
that is affecting your client.
After you did this detective work, the answer to what the essence of the
emotional reaction to that person in his/her life was, needs to be neutralized
but not by written words. It has to be expressed. Ask, ask and ask… so the
story can come to the surface.

Words are extremely dangerous, especially written words. Words have the habit
of being interpreted. And the one that interprets generally interprets things
differently than was intended. This can mean that you are not neutralizing the
real issue.
You really need to keep asking “why?”. If something comes to the surface that
gives you goose bumps, then you have found a substantial and real answer. But
if this happens there is no need to do anything with it anymore. Then it starts
dissolving right away.
After the realization the client can be assisted in letting go by putting the 1
/issue note in the cup and treating with a normal program. But it is not a real
necessity anymore.

So the only thing I still do with the notes is to determine if an answer that a
client comes up with him/herself is valid. I only use to test something that
comes directly from the client and that the client has written him/herself. It
is very important to stay objective in treatment always.

Conclusion: I never treat with notes, since I found them to be ineffective in
treatment. They can have some value in assessment though, but even for this I
hardly ever need them.

The Neutralization Program

You should be very careful with the Neutralization Program. If you only suspect
the problem, do not use this program. The program uses no filter and if the
problem is not there, you might install the problem in your client. It is the
same with a homoeopathic remedy: if you keep using it after a problem has been
solved, the remedy causes the problem to reappear.
So do not use the Neutralization Program for a suspected problem.

You may test with a note but be careful not to project anything and to be 110%
objective in your measurement. If you don’t receive but send information
(assumptions) you change your measurements and they are not valid anymore. 
While measuring you should never think or assume anything.

If you suspect a problem, and you want to use a note, you need to use the
standard program and the 1/issue method of writing it. This way you know for
sure you won’t create problems instead of solving them.

Also with drugs and chemicals, only neutralize them if you know for sure there
is a problem with them. I only neutralize chemicals/drugs when the client
stopped taking them and then only once! After this you can create a problem by
bringing the information into the body instead of getting it out.

Conclusion: If something is NOT in the body neutralization can CAUSE the
problem that you’re neutralizing for.
When you want to be completely safe create a remedy of the substance on a card
with the Neutralization Program and run this remedy with the standard programs,
which have a filter.

    Hi Johan,

    I am very happy with this clarification about neutralizing! As you say, I
    also experienced that 'the conversation' is solving a lot, as people get
    insight in themselves. (and yes I also experienced these fantastic goose
    bumps!) And I still have questions...

    1/ You said somewhere on this forum that notes can help for dia-gnosis, but
    don't work for toxins/diseases. So it won't be possible to check this way
    for exemple if there is Lupus? or if the allergy is caused by grass/gluten/
    ao?

    2/ What do you mean by the 'normal program' with 1/issue note?
    Standard-adults 9'?

    3/ If so, can you fill the slots with 7/8 other measured nosodes/remedies?

    4/ Working with 2 glassrods, the light-circuit of the client is going in/
    out to chiren. What happens with neutralisation with 1 rod? Information
    comes from Chiren to client? not travelling on the clients own light?

    5/ about chemicals/drugs: I have some clients with huge med-history. Is it
    suitable, when they stopped them, to measure them for remaining residues
    (by using the cup) and neutralize them if confirmed. In some cases I cannot
    imagine to create remedies of all those substances.

    Hi Inge

    1) Allergy is a symptom and Lupus is label for a series of symptoms that
    fit in a box made up by men.You need to observe and listen to the body and
    not to men's inventions to get an accurate assessment. Nature knew how to
    heal far before humans started to reflect on healing. A disease label is of
    no use in the therapy, because the body has no knowledge/understanding of
    these names. 

    In Biontology no medical diagnoses are necessary or even possible to make.
    It has a whole different approach towards health. If someone comes in with
    a diagnosis, you have to ask the client "what are your symptoms?" and
    observe. Even if you think you know a disease pattern (because you have
    learned about it and know this disease!), you really don't. A person is not
    a disease. Every client is different, with different causes to led to
    different imbalances.    

    Biontology is a generalistic approach of healing with the goal to restore
    the healthy functionality of the complete body, that will initiate
    self-healing even from symptoms you weren't aware of. The body knows best
    what is wrong with it. Why would you want to put people in a box? 
   
    The only thing Johan tests are problems on an emotional level, so he never
    writes diagnoses or physical problems on a piece of paper. 
    Emotional problems stem from thinking and notes can help make a client
    aware of the ideas that led to the issues. But usually Johan just listens
    (without any notes) and lets clients express their problems, this is very
    healing in itself. The notes can be a tool to start a conversation and
    pinpoint the exact issue a client has. Often ideas don't match reality and
    this is where notes can help too.
   
    Food allergies are caused by a digestive tract that is not healthy,
    restoring the intestines will usually get rid of these symptoms. 

    2) What is meant by normal program is all programs that don't neutralise.
    So all programs except for the Allergy/Neutralisation program. You can use
    these notes for all Standard Programs and also on the footplates.
    But don't focus too much on the notes. They're not going to do the
    healing. 

    3) Yes, that's the idea. 
    If you would want to use a note though, don't use it in your first hand
    treatment but put it on the footplates as a support. All information that
    is measurable can correct drops temporarely without containing the right
    information for the body to really make a substantial change physically, so
    notes can mask too.
   
    You first need to work with the full protocol, by using the nosodes to
    correct the energetic system, then using the Heel support remedies for
    focussed organ support and only then, on the footplates, you can use one
    ore two flower remedies and add a note in the cup. 
   
    4) Interesting question Inge. The answer is: If you hold only the (light)
    sending rod, the light of your body doesn't go into the Chiren so it can't
    come out on the other side. So, no in the Neutralisation Program there's no
    own light involved. But photons (without the bio) are everywhere and
    probably information uses those to travel on. 
   
    5) Johan commented on medication/toxins in several discussions. Usually you
    don't need to neutralise them and the body will start cleaning the toxins
    out by itself because of the biophoton treatment. I would suggest yo to
    read all posts on the forum. We just started but there's already a wealth
    of information....
    Neutralisation of medication/toxins on a note doesn't do anything.

Work Environment - Returning Spin Inversion

    Happy New Year Karolina & Johan

    Client:
    Man who has come in for 9 sessions and is always in Spin Inversion.

    Work Environment:
    Computer company with more than 50 computers in one room as they do
    customer support work for a software company 

    Result of Biontology Sessions:
    There are still some drops but he has no symptoms. 
    He feels good with lots of energy
    The issues he originally came in for have totally resolved except for the
    constant Spin Inversion. 

    Challenge:
    He likes his job and the company. He doesn't want to leave the company.

    Question:
    Is there anything he can do in the environment to block whatever is causing
    him to go into Spin Inversion?

    Thank you Richard, a happy new year to you too.

    There is no way his environment can actually become healthy. 
    Or in Johan's words: "I would not know of anything except pulling the
    electricity from the building"

    As Spin Inversion caused by his work environment probably was the big
    underlying cause of the symptoms he initially visited you with, you may
    have helped his body to deal with it for a while, but when he continues to
    be exposed to this environment it will at one point bring him back to
    square one. Even if he does not get Spin Inversion anymore his body is
    still suffering from the extreme exposure to EMF's. 

    Let's compare it to someone who eats Big Macs every day.. there is a
    certain plateau of health that is reasonably attainable in this situation.
    Even the strongest body will not thrive on a diet like that and at one
    point will start to show symptoms.

    I have a client with similar treatment experience.

    Client: 64 year old male psychiatrist working with children in a prison
    setting.

    Symptoms:  Difficulty falling and staying asleep, tendency for elevated
    blood pressure, exhaustion by end of work week, constipation and hearing
    heartbeat in ear while in bed.
   
    EMF Exposure:  He has removed all electrical appliances in his bedroom. He
    sleeps on a foam mattress. His computer has Wi-Fi which he keeps unplugged
    except when using. One of his offices which he uses on Mondays and
    Thursdays has Wi-Fi.

    Results of Sessions:  For the first 5 sessions, needed to treat twice to
    eliminate spin. Then continued to have most points dropping. However, the
    points were easily corrected following protocol.
    All symptoms disappeared by the 4th treatment and he felt very energetic
    and sleeping well.
    The 6th treatment only needed to correct spin with one treatment and there
    were fewer drops.

    I saw him for his 7th treatment today after a month's hiatus due to the
    holidays. It took one treatment to correct his spin and there were no other
    drops. He continues to feel great and sleeping well.

    He has been using his Chikey 4-5 times weekly to correct spin.

    Questions:

    1.  What is the explanation for the symptoms disappearing while continuing
    to have points dropping?
         
    2.  Is there healing taking place even in the presence of spin inversion?
     Can the body be strengthened with the treatments to protect it from
    getting spin inversion?

    3.  I've told him to see me in a month for a recheck. Should he be seen
    more frequently?

    Answers:

    1. It could be that there are other issues that causes these drops and that
    the symptoms that do disappear are not related to them. Maybe you assumed
    certain points should clear for the symptoms to disappear, but other
    systems were involved than you thought. It may also be that there are
    layers that you are pealing of and that a more severe disturbance is gone
    but that a less severe disturbance is still causing a drop.

    2. If he treats himself regularly he could stay long enough out of Spin
    Inversion for healing to take effect.

    3. First and foremost you need to find out where the Spin Inversion comes
    from.
    Perhaps it is the house or the working environment or perhaps his glasses
    or dental work… 

    The symptoms indicate Gallbladder issues. The constipation could indicate a
    problem with his Intestinal Bacteria, which again might indicate
    Appendicitis in one of its forms.

    Happy New Year, everyone!

    Concerning your statement, Karolina: 'Even if he does not get Spin
    Inversion anymore his body is still suffering from the extreme exposure to
    EMF's', what does biontology suggest clients do to heal themselves amidst
    the currently high exposures to EMF and magnetic fields everywhere short of
    moving to a remote location (if there even are such places anymore)? Are
    frequent spin treatments between full chiren treatments the best option for
    those of us forced to live in the environments with disturbances?

    I think we would all like to move away from disturbances but sometimes we
    cannot, for one reason or another.
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel

    We all would like to move away from the modern society to get rid of the
    exposure.
    But the other solution and perhaps the only solution is to.make the body
    strong enough to repel all disturbing forces.
    If there are frequent Spin Inversions, one needs to find the cause of these
    Spin Inversions and eliminate this cause. That is the first thing that
    needs to be done.

    What are their symptoms? You focus too much on a diagnosis. 

    Diagnoses are more distracting then helpful in Biontology. So always ask a
    client what the symptoms are, then measure and from that you get the
    general picture of what is going on in the body and what is needed.

    If Lyme shows up all the time, this remedy is not the one you need and you
    have to look for different remedies that focus on the terrain. I hardly
    ever need Lyme as a remedy in treating clients that were told they've got
    Lyme's disease.

    Symptoms: Very tired physically and mentally, concentration problems, bad
    memory, not easy to learn new things, need quiteness, eyeproblems (
    muscles),  depressed  and maybe more

    These patient know that they were bit by ticks many years ago.( and some
    had also an infection in the central nervous system, I know that this is a
    diagnose...)

    So if nosode Lyme matches many times it is not the correct nosode?

    I look forward to read your answer.

    A diagnosis doesn't tell you anything you can use for your treatment, the
    symptoms do. 

    Even if the Lyme is there, this is not the direct cause of the symptoms.
    Otherwise everybody who has Lyme's disease (or any other bacteria, virus,
    parasite) would have the same symptoms immediately after infection. Usually
    the symptoms of Lyme only start after a stressful period (physically or
    emotionally). 

    When one develops all these symptoms right after infection, the terrain
    must have been weak to begin with. This is why Lyme's disease is mostly
    seen in people with a stressful childhood (abuse, neglect, trauma etc.).
    Often there's a lot of suppression. Many of the symptoms you describe can
    be caused by Liver (depression, exhaustion, sensitivity to light and
    sound), Gallbladder and Intestines (bad memory). 

    Did they all receive antibiotics? Because this might have ruined the
    intestinal flora (memory, thinking).
    What is their background?


    To treat Lyme or any other chronic infection, you have to focus on the
    terrain, the overall condition of the body. When Gallbladder and Liver are
    treated, old issues that were suppressed might come up and resolve and
    tension is lifted. The clients then still have to learn how to follow their
    own hearts. Talk with them about that. 

    Less stress means better immune function and self-healing ability. Lyme can
    only thrive in an unhealthy body and mind.

    The homeopathic remedy Apis Mellifica, that is part of the remedy Apis

March 2015 - Remedy Point Combinations Impossible?

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Q&A Flag
Question
In the review of my case study you wrote that certain combinations between
remedies and points are impossible, but I was taught to not assume anything,
and that everything could match anywhere. Can you explain?

Answer
If you just look at the symptoms that according to homeopaths match the picture
of a remedy, you will find that a single remedy can resolve symptoms relating
to many organ systems. But this is because an affection of ONE system can
affect ALL systems. That does however not mean that this remedy should match
all the organ systems that show symptoms!
A homeopathic remedy can be considered to be an energetic key. It has a very
specific energetic signature. The same accounts for the acupuncture points and
connected systems, they have a very specific energetic demand and can be
considered the energetic keyholes. Some remedies are like skeleton keys that
fit many locks, but there are also remedies that only match very specific
points. Just like there are points that only very specific remedies match on.
Biontology is experience based. When I started out testing thousands of
remedies, many of them with elaborate descriptions just did not deliver what
they promised. And on the other hand I found other remedies that were showing
up many times and made for miraculous improvement. The research I have done was
quite extensive and sometimes meant working with a single client for 4 hours
going through all remedies in a very systematic way.
When I say that certain remedies cannot match it is because I have tested all
the remedies in the Chiren extensively, on many people and with many different
conditions and I have seen them show up on the same systems over and over
again.

In your training I started to emphasize not to project because I found that so
many people were matching remedies according to their ideas. I have noticed a
pattern of non-objectivity in measurements that I now start to understand a bit
I think. What happens is that for example one starts reading on the Internet,
and then draws conclusions from this. One can read that Mercury is PHYSICALLY
found in Bones, Kidneys and Pituitary. This is then all of a sudden
miraculously found on these organs, but objective testing does not confirm this
at all.
The thing is that even though something is physically present in certain
organs, it does not necessarily disturb the functions that you measure.
Presence in the Pituitary for example does not mean that it affects the Hormone
part of this organ. The nervous part of the Pituitary however is NOT measured
on the Hormone System meridian, but on the Nervous System meridian and there it
IS possible to find Mercury.
Objective experience learns that many expectations that you may have, based on
physical and physiological research are not valid in the energetic assessment
we do. The same accounts for the field of action of homeopathic remedies. The
remedies may have a very broad field of action, but still they are only
MEASURED on very specific systems. Medorrhinum or Luesinum for example are not
measured on the Intestines ever. This is just one of the strange measurements I
have seen.
Miasms may have elaborate descriptions in homeopathic textbooks because
Hahnemann thought them to be the foundation of all diseases, but this does not
reflect in Biontology at all. There is absolutely no special relevance to the
miasms over other remedies.

The measurement suggestions given in the protocol are based on the assumption
that the reader can measure. It would be too elaborate to describe every remedy
per point. This means that nosodes when indicated for a certain meridian often
do not show up on all points in the same way.
*Stones for example show up on the stone points.
*Staph and Strep MAY match the Stomach meridian, but ONLY the jaw/dental point.

I have seen people correct the 6 drops on the Hormone System with 1 remedy, but
Hormone glands have very specific locations and are very different in function.
It is highly uncommon for just one or two remedies to correct all these points.
Some remedies are very specific to certain points! You will not find
Poliomyelitis on the Thyroid for example.

So what I am trying to explain is that there are distinct patterns where
remedies match and where they never match! Not every nosode will match just
anywhere. Different organs have different energetic and informational patterns
and points reflect that. So one cannot assume that everything can just match
anywhere. In theory maybe, but practice shows otherwise.

    The Chiren is unique in it's ability to effectively and safely administer
    remedies via biophoton light.  Unfortunately there are many instruments
    being used for assessment with the sole intention of selling supplements,
    which does nothing to deal with the cause of illness. 

    Due to the problem of projection, and human error, with Voll technology: 
    Are you considering changing to one of the more objective measurement
    systems for your next generation of Chiren?

    This is the best measurement system I know of. Especially since every skin,
    point and person is different you cannot have the same measurement with a
    standard system that does not involve a therapist who can correct for all
    those factors.

    Also, there are many systems that pretent to measure, but that are in fact
    randomly spitting out diagnoses. The "quantum" systems you were referring
    to before are doing just that.

    Concerning the initial question: I find it very helpful to take the
    Biontology text and list all the remedies according to their pathway.  As
    you do this, for each remedy, put the other pathways that it has in common
    along side of that single remedy.  You can use this to cross reverence - at
    least - to keep you in the correct range of choices.  For example,
    Medorrhium is listed in the Hormones, but it is also Bladder and Kidney. 
    This helps me to understand where Biontology has seen it's effects via Voll
    Points.  I think it will also give one an understanding of how the use of
    it on Sex Hormone point will 'fix' the Bladder and/or the Kidney or visa
    versa.  I'm still in 'process' about this, so any words of enlightenment
    will be appreciated.  Biontology like any system of experiential learning
    will have it's unique findings.  So trying to apply "directly" any other
    system to Biontology will result in a philosophical or intellectual
    scheme.  Biontology is Biontology - it is not classical homeopathy or
    classical acupuncture.  We can use these systems as aids but it has to be
    confirmed in the practice of Biontology.

    What has helped me a lot was making a list of all the meridiens  and under
    each one listing all the possible remedies that match that meridien. And
    next to each remedy I list all other meridiens where that remedy might be
    matched. And then I put a short description of each remedy. I did
    everything based on the book that Karolina wrote. I feel like it's very
    helpful for the beginners.

    Thanks for all these tips! Sometimes the remedies in the Chiren seem
    overwhelming, especially to those of us still in the early learning stages.

    I am also very relieved and glad to hear Karolina's clear explanation of
    the difference between physical and energetic readings. Our society places
    so much emphasis on rational science. I agree that on the internet it is
    not that easy to find information in support of the correlations
    Biontologists make from experience and repeated observation. We should all
    keep in mind that the most popular Internet Search engines only serve up a
    tiny fraction of what is on the entire www -- what is not indexed is at
    least, by some estimates, 400-500X larger and growing.

    I've done the same, Maggie.
    What I would like to know after we have made a list like this, does this
    mean that the remedies that are not listed for a particular meridian, will
    not be used on that meridian. 

    Question
    For example, Rubella is listed for Hormones, Nervous System and Liver, but
    can it be used for Bladder, or any other meridian?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    September 2015 edited September 2015 Flag
    Answer
    In theory it can, in practice these are the meridians where the nosodes 
    usually show up if they do. 

    Of course, you always need to stay open for those rare occasions, but you
    can trust that if you need to divert from the normal correlations
    frequently, that there is an unreliability in your measurements. 

    Also, if a nosode corrects a meridian that is not mentioned, then usually
    the systems that are most likely affected show up too. Taking your example:
    Say Rubella shows up on the Bladder, then the Hormones, Nervous System and/
    or Liver are likely to have drops that are corrected by this nosode too.

    If your measurements have been trained enough to be reliable (showing in
    the fact that mainly you will find the normal correlations), but you find
    that nothing of the usual matches, then you can start to look for
    out-of-the-ordinary remedies for the meridians/points.

    This is truly a 'pearl', as well as confirming my understanding of this. 
    This is the reason why your book is so valuable, clinically.  It might be
    too much to ask, but a further asset to remedy choice would be to
    prioritize the use of a remedy within it's scope of use. For example,
    Strep. Haemolyticus, which is listed -
    Kidney,Heart,Lung,Lymph,Bladder,Stomach(Jaw) - if it is know that this
    nosode is used less on the Bladder and more on the Heart then the
    practitioner would be more informed. 
    Thank you

    Research is best done the other way around, since focus should be on the
    meridian and less so on the remedy. If you look up the Bladder in the
     "Measurement Protocol", you will find that there is no mention of Strep in
    the list (or in older versions it is way down at the bottom of the list).

    Sugar or Aspartame addiction.... either way, to become healthy I believe he
    has to seriously cut down on or stop this habit of drinking dr. Pepper.
    The products that Aspartame breaks down into are highly toxic and can cause
    all symptoms you describe..... So if he takes the light variety of dr.
    Pepper with Aspartame, you have most likely found the cause of his symptoms
    and he just has to stop drinking it.
   
    If you do see him next time, it would be interesting to know if he started
    to drink the dr. Pepper when he already had health problems or if after he
    started drinking the symptoms started.

    Breakdown products: Aspartame -> Methanol -> Formaldehyde -> Formic acid

    Note on Aspartame: since the body breaks down Aspartame immediately and the
    toxicity is from its break-down products it doesn't make any sense to
    neutralize the substance itself! 
    Also "detoxing Aspartame" is illogical, since the body doesn't store it (
    methanol is very slowly excreted though and can have build up). If the body
    would be able to store the Aspartame instead of breaking it down, it would
    probably be far less toxic...

    Methanol eventually is converted to Formaldehyde in the body! 

    Since Formaldehyde is the cause for toxicity of both Methanol and
    Aspartame, this is the remedy to use after exposure to one of these
    substances.

Breast, Liver and Bone cancers

Carol
February 2013 edited February 2014 in General Questions Flag
55 year old woman with a history of two cancers early in her life.  She was
then cancer free for 19.5 years.  Now she has been diagnosed with breast, bone
and liver cancers.  She has had many vaccinations throughout her life including
as an adult.

Medical History:
Age 14 had oral surgery to remove supernumary tooth with cyst.  Supernumary
tooth is an extra tooth in the mouth.
Age 29 had a level 1 melanoma removed from her left ankle
Age 32 had a muco-epidermal carcinoma (intermediate grade) salvary gland
origin.  Partial Maxillectomy (removed part of jaw bone and about 4 teeth)  on
the left side of upper jaw. 
Age 53 breast cancer  Lumpectomy stage 3  Chemo 
Later that year another breast cancer discovered 
Bilateral mastectomy Feb 2011 
May 2012 breast lump right chest wall-- Lumpectomy
November 2012 two more breast tumors found surgery to remove but "they didn't
get it all"
February 2013  Multiple lesions on Liver and Bones found on MRIs

Exposure to TOXINS:
In her early career she had exposure to Polystrene, Ethylene Oxide,
PVC-Polyvinyl Chloride, Alcohols- Methyl,Ethyl and Isopropyl, and a solvent for
bonding "MEK" Methyl Ethyl Ketone.
 
When she came for treatment, she only knew that with the most recent  Breast
cancer  "they didn't get it all".  She then had 5 MRIs done.  She called back
with the report about multiple lesions on the liver and bones.

Measurement:
Every meridian except Liver, Spleen and Pancreas was dropping.  

Treatment:
Whiplash Program
Spin Inversion Program

Standard >12 Program with:
Polio
Variolinum
Anti-Tetanus
Varicellen
Selenium
Pertussis
Causticum
Aluminum

Dyslexia program:          
Cystopylonephritis  (halfway change)  Berberis
Aesculus
Adenoma Mammae  (halfway change)  Sutoxol
Carcinoma Mammae  (halfway change) Glyoxal

    Can you tell more about the measurement after the Whiplash? Did it correct
    anything? And when you did the Spin Inversion Program, what were your
    measurements afterward?

    Which systems were dropping and where did you find the remedies? 

    If she did the MRI's right after your treatment I'm afraid she's in a
    Spin-Inversion again. MRI has one of the strongest electro-magnetic fields
    that you can encounter..... If clients are about to do an MRI the best
    thing you can do is to postpone your treatment until right after that.

    I would advise against using Heavy Metals in the first session, when
    elimination organs are not functioning correctly yet...

    I’ve been looking through the Heel manual to get familiar with what is in
    the various support remedies. I was surprised to find that some of them
    have Nosodes in them. For instance Metro-Adnex and Momordica contain
    Lachesis (snake venom).

    I can see that we need to carefully research the various support remedy
    ingredients before making clients cards that are intended for frequent use
    with the 2-7 program.

    Thank you for being observant! ;-) 

    This is also why "Support" remedies shouldn't be overused... Some Supports
    carry even Heavy Metals..
    Just one note.... Lachesis is not a Nosode. Nosodes are made from a disease
    or bacteria/virus/parasite. Heavy Metals aren't Nosodes either, but should
    be treated as such (by not overusing them).

    A list of Supports carrying either Nosodes or Heavy Metals:

    Aesculus - Cuprum
    Cerebrum - Medorrhinum
    Cutis - Pyrogenium
    Discus - Medorrhinum
    Echinacea - Pyrogenium, Influenza, Streptococcus Heamolyticus
    Galium - Pyrogenium
    Gynacoheel - Palladium, Platinum
    Klimaktheel - Stannum
    Mucosa - Bacterium Coli
    Solidago - Pyrogenium, Bacterium Coli, Coxsackie A9
    Syzygium - Plumbum
    Tonico - Aurum
    Tonsilla - Pyrogenium, Psorinum

    Karolina - I appreciate this list, because in my studies with HEEL over the
    years, I also learned that there are nosodes in many of the supports we
    use...for example:

    Belladonna ==> has Echinacea (which you list above)
    Chelidonium ==> has Belladonna in it
    Cocculus ==> has Petroleum
    Husteel ==> has Belladonna and Cuprum
    Lymphomyosot ==> has Scrophularia nosode
    Plantago ==> has Belladonna
    Populus ==> has Scrophularia nosode
    Psorinum ==> has Vaccinum and Medorrhinum
    Mezereum ==> has Arsenic? Is this a Nosode because of Arsenic? It is listed
    in the manual as a Support..

    Questions:

    1. I have used these remedies many times with the thought that they
    also contain Nosodes in them that work for many conditions we find. Is this
    incorrect? 

    2. Also, many of these have contraindications for pregnant women. Do we
    need to think about that when we are using the information of the Nosodes? 
    .

    1. This list is just a warning to be aware that support remedies are also
    potent and sometimes have Nosodes in them. So to not think too lightly
    about them and to never overdose on anything... 

    2. In Biontology there are no contra-indications for Pregnancy, but of
    course one should have common sense to especially not overdo the treatment
    in this condition.... 
    The body will select what Remedies are needed from everything that you
    offer, so anything that will cause imbalance when used as a supplement
    (homeopathic pellets/liquids) won't do this through the Chiren treatment.
    The only thing you can do is stimulate the body to do too much and in the
    wrong sequence.... 
    So to answer your question more specifically: The remedies that have
    contra-indications in Homeopathy don't in Biontology...

    About your list:

    Echinacea, Scrophularia Nodosa (plant), Petroleum and Arsenic are all no
    Nosodes... 
    Although in someone with Arsenic or Petroleum poisoning these two Remedies
    could cause detox and would be on the list with Nosodes/Toxins/Heavy
    Metals....

    Husteel is not in the Chiren....

    Psorinum is a Nosode itself and has no other components in there....
   
    Mezereum is a Support remedy

     Nosodes? I thought you showed Echinacea with nosodes in it in the list
    above. Also, is Psorinum similar to Psorinheel?

    Maybe I can answer your Question.

    "Echinacea, Scrophularia Nodosa (plant), Petroleum and Arsenic are all no
    Nosodes"
    This is right, they are not Nosodes.

    Echinacea( augustifolia) ===> is a plant and not a Nosode, but in the
    Echinacea Compositum there are Nosodes: Pyrogenium, influenza,
    sterptoccocus haem. and staphyloccocus.

    Psorinum and Psorinoheel are not the same 

    Psorinum ===> is a Nosode in different potencies

    Psorinoheel ===> is a combined preparation, which contains various Nosodes,
    and we don't have it in Chiren.

    Excuse me... language problem... I did mean not Nosodes.

    Yes.... I showed Echinacea Compositum, which has as component Nosodes....
    but Echinacea itself as a component of another Compositum doesn't contain
    anything else than Echinacea.... does this make sense? (see the above

    Psorinum is not Psorinoheel, but the Nosode Psorinum in the potencies D12,

May 2015 - Endorphins Caused by Stress?

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
May 2015 in Q&A Flag
Questions
I observed how stress immediately caused endorphins in a client. She had drops
when I first measured her, but we had to stop so she could answer a call from
the hospital. The conversation turned out to be long and stressful, and when I
tried to measure her after there were no drops anymore. My measuring still
needs lots of practice, but the client had very easy hands so I am almost sure
that the stress caused endorphins in her case.

A. What is your view on this?

B. Can you tell me which remedies you mean by “all Gallbladder remedies”?

C. When you say: “just put in all Gallbladder remedies” to lift endorphins, do
you mean:
1. Run a 2-7 years program with all Gallbladder remedies? This, to me, seems
like too much information for the body.
Or:
2. Only measure with these Gallbladder remedies?

D. If because of endorphins all points are straight and nothing can change
this. And by nothing I mean measuring/treating with Atropinum, Viscum, Plumbum
and measuring/treating with Gallbladder remedies, should I then treat based on
symptoms?


Answers
A. I have never seen such an immediate reaction of a body. The telephone call
must have been extremely stressful, or she may have been stressed because she
was worried to bother you with her phone call and not so much about he call
itself. 

I would talk to her and try to calm her down first before continuing measuring/
treating. In general it is important to be present to the client as to have a
grounded and calming effect on your clients. If you are in a chaotic state of
mind yourself this can also influence your measurements of your client, so it
might as well been you who became stressed due to the phone call.

What is important to realize is that this is clearly a case of immediate
stress, and not caused by something internal. So what is needed is to De-Stress
her. You can de-stress by using the remedies Atropinum and Chelidonium. 

B. When I refer to Gallbladder remedies I mean: Atropinum, Berberis,
Chelidonium

C. I would put these remedies in and try to measure with these remedies to see
if anything shows up. If this still doesn’t work, I would try a short treatment
with those remedies in and perhaps Viscum and Plumbum, but no more. After this
special attention should be paid to the Kidneys. Plumbum is a Heavy Metal and
should never be used recklessly, especially since it is probably to soon in
this case. But when you don’t have any information to go on it may be needed.

D. The normal adult treatment is far more relaxing than the short treatment.
If the short treatment does not provide the level of relaxation that one would
desire, I would put the remedies in again and treat with the normal adult
treatment. One can in addition put some other support remedies in that support
the kidneys for example.
Then after the normal adult session, I would measure again. If then still
nothing would show up I would terminate the session and tell her to come back
another time. Don’t continue trying other things because you already gave her a
lot of treatment and you will surely overdose.
Make sure she rests and drinks properly, and most likely you will be able to
measure her next time.

    I have just experienced this with a client, a teen, who's mom has been very
    depressed and sick for some years.  They both are being treated with the
    Chiren, mom first the the son.  Mom had a break down after her treatment
    and son's reading were radically changed after this - all high.  The only
    points down were the Spin Inversion points and aura. I needled for Spin
    Inversion and his blood spat out, his comment, 'I guess I have a lot of
    adrenalin'.  He obviously knew he was reacting to his mother's condition.

    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    May 2015 edited May 2015 Flag
    What you have measured is an aura problem, not Spin Inversion. 

    The points became higher in sound because of increased circulation due to
    stress. He might have even started to sweat a little bit because of the
    emotional response, making the points sound even higher (the electrical
    current travels very easily through water). The increased circulation also
    made the blood "spat out".

    The aura can react dramatically on emotional stress, but you will not get
    into Spin Inversion (at least not immediately and without exposure to an
    electromagnetic source). So the only thing that was probably necessary is
    to calm the situation down before continuing to measure and treat. Possibly
    Ozaliet maybe needed, but usually a bit of "grounding" and calming down is
    enough. Just sitting your clients down, asking them to focus on their feet
    and how they sit in the chair will help restore the aura enough to continue
    measurement/treatment. If the hands are sweaty you can dry them off with
    paper towel.

    Yes, Yes, I got this afterwards, and reaffirmed this on the next session. 
    He often has an aura issue. Thank you.  Actually he was not sweating nor
    showing signs of stress, just showing how well he has adapted to this by
    internalizing.

Rheumatoid Arthritis

Barbaralee
November 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
Young man, 23 years old, came to see me for help with his Arthritis.

Symptoms:
Joint swelling and stiffness => beginning at age 12.
Joint pain causes him to wake up often during the night
Different joints hurt at different times => "I wake up in the morning and a
joint that didn't hurt, hurts and is swollen."
His brain is foggy all day.
He just can't seem to wake up.
Sinuses feels swollen all the time

History:
Active youth => sports, not much of a student (his words)
Mother => was drug addict
Father => alcoholic (but never missed a days work)
Both parents smoked
Terrible diet as a child, lots of sugar
He smokes almost a pack of cigarettes a day
Works on concrete construction crew 6 days a week, 12 to 14 hours a day

Medical Interventions:
All vaccinations in childhood
Plenty of fillings in his mouth by the time he was 8.
Bi-lateral hernia surgery with mesh

Medications:
Nothing, but Aleve when experiencing acute pain
Used Prednisone/Naproxen/Hydroquinone for years (since age 12) until liver
enzymes became elevated.
His M.D. off and on prescribed 6 Ibruprophen 3 times a day for pain.

Diagnoses by other therapists:
Fungus/Parasites/Gluten Intolerance

I expected many drops in the triple warmer. Here's what happened instead.

Scar Treatment:
Laproscopic incisions
Glass rods with Procrainum over the actually site of hernia repair (extensive
with mesh)

Measurement:
No Whiplash or Spin Inversion

Adrenals
Lungs (L) - 2 points
Large Intestine (L) - 1 point
Nervous System (L) - 2 points
Small Intestine (L) - 3 points

Lungs (R) - 1 point
Nervous System (R) - 1 point
Small Intestine (R) - 3 points

Skin (L) -1 point

Stomach (R) - 3 points
Skin (R) - 1 point
Gallbladder (R) - 1 point

>12 Years Program:
Selenium, Mercury, Cadmium, Salmonella Typhi, Salmonella Paratyphi, Listeriose,
Nagelmykose

Footplates:
Viscum, Thalamus, Cerebrum, Albumoheel, Solidago, Mucosa, Phosphor, Bryaconeel

Question/Remarks:
1 Pituitary nor Parathyroid or any other Hormone Gland dropped except for the
Adrenals.
Could something be masking this, or does he really processes these well?

2 Symptomatic I could have used Kalmia Compositum, 
I would have used Osteoheel if the Parathyroid and Thyroid had dropped,
I should have put in Atropinum (but didn't), 
Instead I focused on Kidney support to help him dump the Mercury and Cadium. 
I also realize maybe some Liver support although he had no drops there.

3 Anyway, as we strive to get to causal, my gut hit here is that this kid was
basically born healthy, was feed terrible food, and now has a mouth full of
metal, which he his body can't detox and has caused him joint pain. Is it too
early to tell whether or not his issues are related to his teeth?

I'm going to see him 2 more times. Then I'm wondering about dentistry care and
how we determine and advise folks to seek that?

    Thank you for posting this case, it took some time going over it with
    Johan, but I feel that there are a lot of good points of learning in it. 
   
    The symptoms your client experiences point in the direction of failing
    Adrenals, Kidneys, Bladder, Circulation and Veins. Also the Parathyroid
    seems to not function properly:

    * Swelling, Stiffness and difficulty to get up in the morning are all
    circulatory/fluid issues.
    * The swollen sinuses show a Bladder problem.
    * Dental problems in childhood show there has been a seriously affected
     Calcium Metabolism from a young age.
   
    Since your measurements don't reflect the real issues, there's definitely a
    lot of suppression and maybe other measurement problems. The measurement
    might be false due to:
   
    * Endorphins => can be caused by his job, which is clearly a huge stress
    for his body, but also by the NSAID's and Steroids that he used or the pain
    medication.
    * Swelling of the fingers, which will especially affect your measurement of
    the proximal points (e.g. Pituitary!)
    * Untreated Scars => someone who has been physically active all his life
    usually has more than just surgical scars. A Scar can block the connection
    between acupuncture point and organ system.
    * Sweaty hands and feet => this is not unusual in case of Rheumatoid
    Arthritis (Kidney problems...), and will cause the measurement circuit to
    short-circuit through the sweat/water instead of measuring the skin
    resistance in the acupuncture point. This will give false positives, with
    high sounds.

    So what to do...?
    * What you do know from the Measurement Protocol is that Poliomyelitis and
    Anti-Tetanus are always a problem for anyone who has been vaccinated for
    these. So what you could have done is put Anti-Tetanus and Poliomyelitis in
    and give a short (2-7 years) treatment. Since these vaccinations have to be
    treated anyway and measurements are not to be trusted because of the
    suppression, this is a legitimate action to take... Usually all kind of new
    drops will show up.

    * The Adrenals should be part of your -initial- focus. You used Selenium,
    but I would use Berberis too and maybe another energy supporting remedy
    like Testis.
    It is very important to emphasise to your client that Biophoton Treatment
    by itself won't work unless he saves more of his energy for healing and
    doesn't spend it all. Biophoton Therapy does nothing except for correcting
    the information pathways, paving the way for the body to heal itself. The
    second step must be taken by the physical body, by responding to the new
    balanced information with physical healing and detoxifying actions. Without
    physical energy this won't happen...
    His lifestyle -long days of physical labour for 6 days a week- is very
    likely to block healing. 

    You mention only seeing him two more times after his first treatment, which
    totals in 3 sessions. This is not going to be sufficient in his condition,
    even if he would cut back on working and rest more.

    Other observations and comments:

    1. Using two Heavy Metals (Cadmium + Mercury) in a first treatment, while
    you know from symptoms that there is a problem with the Kidneys and
    elimination, is a definite no go. This can give a huge aggravation of the
    problem/symptoms. It is also the wrong order of treatment according to the
    protocol, since the Nervous System is not a Yang Organ. The Yang Organs
    should always be treated first before you start to stimulate detox like
    this.

    2. Support remedies should reflect the Organ Systems that you have measured
    and used Nosodes for. Since for sure the Hormonal Glands do have a problem
    it is not necessarily a "wrong" choice to use Viscum and Thalamus, but it
    doesn't match your reasoning and observation where you think that the
    Pituitary, Parathyroid, Thyroid and Pineal might just not have a problem
    (the approach of treatment is not coherent ;-))

    3. Although Diet, Metals etc. might add to his problem they are not causal.
    Other people with the same diet and toxic exposure, but with a better
    functioning discriminating and detoxifying/eliminatory functions don't
    necessarily develop the same symptoms, so the cause lies deeper.
   
    4. When you want to treat the symptoms like you wrote, more effective
    remedies would be Brucella Abortus Bang and Brucellosis, since these
    bacteria cause Joint and Muscle problems. But causally the Adrenals plus
    the Veins (calcification of the valves) are the systems to address.

    5. Nagelmykose is a nosode made of Nail Fungus and is never causal. I also
    wonder on what Organ System you have measured this. The Skin Meridian is
    not a meridian that should be focussed on in the first treatments. Usually
    it is only used after a couple of sessions, and only when a specific Skin
    condition doesn't resolve by addressing underlying issues.

    6. His teeth may be impacted but then the cause is infection and not the
    metals, one can check this with Kieferostitis and Granuloma Denti on the
    proximal points of stomach meridian.
   
    Hope this is helpful, although realistically, due to his lifestyle, you
    might not be able to help the man completely.

    Hi Karolina,

    Yes, this is a great learning case; and your comments helpful.

    Here's my thoughts based on your notes for our next meeting. (Friday night
    at 7pm)

    My client can come back for more treatments, but he had committed to at
    least three. He works out at a gym, so I may gently suggest that instead of
    working out that he rest to balance his energy. He wants to improve his
    diet, I may suggest that he try to switch from coffee and cigarettes in the
    morning to a green smoothie, and to add more potassium to his diet to
    support his adrenals and kidneys.

    As far as treatment tomorrow: 1) Measure and note. 2) Ask if there were any
    other scars/if yes: treat 3) Run polio and anti-tetanus short program 4)
    Re-measure and treat and new drops on TW with immunization/etc. 5) Provide
    kidney remedies of support in the footplates for sure and of course nosodes
    if indicated in the long program. 6) Be mindful of circulation/vein drops.
    7) Choose support remedies like Selenium/Berberis/Testis for supporting
    energy.

    I'll let you know how it goes. 
    Thank you,
    Barbara

    I wish you good luck! ;-)
    Miracles do exist, but without him realising his lifestyle is
    counterproductive to healing I don't have a lot of hope. 

    The green smoothy instead of coffee and cigarettes is a good idea, and tell
    him that if he wants to do something for his health rigorous work-outs are
    not the thing to do right now. Walking (not jogging) in nature would be
    much better, if he can't sit still.

    Curious about your follow up. Your plan of approach sounds good.

    "No drops on the Triple Warmer => 2-7 yrs Program with Polio and Anti/
    Tetanus => Still no drops.
    Atropinum/Viscus/Plumbum => No drops
    Question:
    1. Should this have resulted in drops given his stress load?"

    Answer:
    1. Not if there is Spin Inversion, so you made the right choice to treat
    for it. 

    Questions/Remarks:
    * Why the short program, when the measurement with Poliomyelitis and
    Anti-Tetanus does not show any change in drops (lifting of Endorphin mask)?
     
    When you then don't use them anymore on the longer, phased, adult hand
    treatment, the exposure to these nosodes is not long enough. You should run
    Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus on the >12 years program, whether you
    measure them or not. (Protocol !)

    * Why the Tuberculinum in the first treatment? 
    TB is measured on Lungs and Large Intestines (R). I don't see drops on the
    Intestinal points of the right hands, and If you measured it on the Lungs
    than you focussed on Yin organs too early on in the treatment. First the
    Yang organs should be functioning (Protocol !)

Cerebral Arteries

m3pollack
March 2014 edited March 2014 in Symptoms Flag
Client:
50+ year old man

Measurement:
Cerebral Arteries (R+L) => Aurumheel, Barijodeel and Cholesterium
Thyroid
Proximal Liver points (R+L)  

No other drops

Medical diagnosis:
Scan of the Carotid Artery => revealed absence of plaque => but assessed as an
80 year old artery

Questions:
1. Is this a calcium issue or something else?  

2. I'm not sure if Aurumheel, Barijodeel and Cholesterium were sufficient,
since I used the same remedies last time, and the points relapsed.  

I'd be very appreciative of your feedback.  Many thanks.

    1. Calcification causes blood vessels to degenerate, so the condition of an
    "80 year old artery" (a severely degenerated artery) is likely to be caused
    by a fault in the Calcium Metabolism.

    2. Plaque is regarded as Cholesterol deposits, but I hardly ever measure
    Cholesterinum. So I do not think that Cholesterol deposits are a real
    problem for the Arteries. It might be that Cholesterol is merely a solution
    of the body to strengthen the weakened and Calcified Arteries.

    If you measure Aurumheel and/or Barijodeel on the Arteries then it is
    confirmed that there's Calcification.
    You cannot expect that Calcium deposits are gone in one session. They might
    need treatment of up to 8 sessions before the meridians do not show
    anymore. The measurement of Aurumheel and/or Barijodeel indicate that there
    is Calcium but the measurements do not indicate of how much there is, nor
    do we know how fast the Body releases it.

    But it will not start to release if the Calcium metabolism is not
    corrected.
    Treatment of the Parathyroid in the first session is an absolute necessity,
    as well as the Pituitary, whether they drop or not. (= Anti-Tetanus and
    Poliomyelitis). 
    The reason for the Thyroid to drop might be Whiplash but the absence of
    drops in large parts of the body indicates an Endorphin problem or wrong
    measurements.

    Thank you, Johan.  This is very helpful.  I forgot to mention that this man
    is a runner, and I forgot to tell him to not run/workout before sessions.  

    Questions:
    1. How many days of no workouts would you recommend before a session?
   
    2. How frequently can you repeat the decalcification program assuming there
    are no nosodes?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    March 2014 edited March 2014 Flag
    Answers:
    1. 4 days
   
    2. The Body needs to do the work of cleaning up the Calcifications, not the
    Light Treatment. So there's no use treating more than once a week 
   
    Leave at least 3 days without treatment between biophoton sessions even if
    you only use remedies for decalcification (Barijodeel, Aurumheel,
    Calcoheel)

Metastasized Prostate Cancer - Vitamin C Drip?

janjan
February 2013 edited February 2014 in Medication Flag
I have a new client, measured for the first time today. He stopped palliative
chemo, has advanced metastasized prostate cancer (stage 4) - malignant tumors
body outside the prostate, and severe pain.

I know how you feel about anything other than food being toxic to body but he
has heard that high Vitamin C infusions have been known to reverse cancer. He
wants to start these and wanted to know if it would interfere with treatment.  

I told him clearly I cannot advise him whether to do that or not to do that,
but he asked that I ask you if it would affect the measurements or the
remedying. And...if he would choose to do it, how long after a weekly treatment
should he do it?

Thanks for your help with this.

    Hi Jan,

    Johan's answer would of course be no. Don't surpass the digestive tract
    ever by putting something in your blood vessels that is foreign to the body
    (even something that would be considered natural).

    Two years ago I went against Johan's advise and joined my dear friend with
    cancer in a vitamin C and Ozon drip (I'm always curious and test everything
    out myself). A couple of days after that I asked Johan to treat me and he
    was sweating to find something that could balance my Veins and Circulation
    out.... Big question marks in his eyes ;-). On top of that I didn't feel
    better at all. The doctor who treated us said he had good results in
    symptoms treatment in cancer, but no cures. So I wouldn't do it if I were
    your client. 
    There's a chance that the symptom relief is just due to the endorphin
    reaction because of the drip...

    But of course it is his own choice, making it for him would put extra
    pressure on you to "perform".
    You might for example tell him that if he wants some extra symptom
    treatment, he can choose to do the drip, but it will interfere with the
    condition of his Circulation/Veins and thus his body in our experience.
    Then he can make the choice...

    Hi Karolina, 

    In your last post you mention never surpass the digestive system. 
    I have some patients using suppositories for pain and they find relief with
    less digestive upset than when they take oral anti-inflammatory meds. 
   
    Do you see a negative reaction to treatment with people who have used
    suppositories?

    Hi Richard,

    This is surpassing the digestive system, and it is unhealthy (not only for
    this reason of course). So if not really needed I would advise against it.

    However if these meds really have to be taken because of severe pain, and
    rectal application lessens the side-effects in the gastro-intestinal tract,
    I would prefer that. I think in this situation you have to choose the best
    one of two evils.

    If the gastro-intestinal tract is the main system that has to heal and the
    medication has to be taken.... the choice is easy: don't aggravate the
    situation in Stomach and Intestines by taking the medication orally... 
    But you have to weigh the pro's and con's in every new situation. There's
    no one answer.
   
    This is my opinion, Johan's might be different... I'm not with him right
    now ;-)

    That its not good, not recomended.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    March 2013 edited March 2013 Flag
    No not recommended as best solution, but sometimes needed when severe
    digestive problems (or other causes) have led to a deficiency that is
    dangerous (serious lack of B12 can damage the nerves). 

    When there's truly a dangerous deficiency in a vitamin, which sometimes
    happens, then vitamin injections, drops or pills can be used. With
    dangerous deficiency I mean one that even the medical establishment would
    diagnose. In other cases of subclinical/mild deficiency, just restoring the
    digestive system with the Chiren and eating a healthy diet will be enough.

    Stomach, Duodenum, Gallbladder, Liver and Large Intestines (Intestinal
    Flora) play a role in B12 absorption and utilization.

    All intra-muscular injections are foreign to the body, the B12 shots too,
    but they don't put strain on the veins like a drip does. So don't use them
    if they are not absolutely needed. A vitamin drip is advised against
    always.

    Karolina, given the answer posted above, would the Chiren by itself be able
    to restore the nerve damage due to deficiency as well as the vitamin
    deficiency?

    Hi Sylvia,

    The Chiren can help the body resolve the underlying cause of the vitamin
    deficiency, since this is usually an absorption/utalization problem. 
    But of course then there has to be something for the body to absorb too....
    (A balanced diet will give enough to absorb if a body is healthy, no need
    for extreme measurements.)
   
    Also the nerves can heal with the Chiren treatment, but if a deficiency on
    a physical level persists symptoms will easily return. The body needs
    substance...

Alternative Treatments

Jiri
November 2013 edited January 2014 in Other Therapies & Instruments Flag
I have a number of clients that are using a variety of alternative treatments
and devices. 
Personally, I would like to see them stop them all and concentrate on biophoton
therapy. However, they are deeply convinced that they help and will not
influence treatment. 

Question:
Would you please comment on using each of the following treatments and devices.

1.  I have a client with EMF sensitivities that just started using an IMRS mat.
Does this affect biophoton treatment? I gave him the information concerning the
micro-current mat but he thinks this is very different and will not affect
treatment.

2. A client uses various cleansings of the liver, gallbladder and intestinal
systems by Dr. Schutze made from botanical ingredients.

3. Coffee enemas

4. Homeopathic remedies

5. 3600 mg vitamin C daily for Morgellen's symptoms

6. Oxy-mag for chronic constipation

7. Thermography

The list is really endless. I have a client that has spent over $20,000 in the
last 4 months on alternative treatments. I'd appreciate any feedback.

    1. The IMRS mat is sabotaging to self-healing, so not compatible with
    Biontology.
    In order for a magnetic field to be beneficial it should be a completely
    equal strength field of maximal 300-500 nano-tesla, but the EM field of
    this mat is somewhere between 45 and 400 micro-tesla, which is 100-1000
    times stronger than desired.
    This means that this mat is not safe to the body and will cause it to
    produce endorphins as a suppressive reaction to the stress that it causes. 

    2. Herbal cleanses are detrimental to natural peristalsis = self
    regulation, so not compatible with Biontology.
    Herbal cleanses usually contain laxative herbs (Schulze's cleanses
    definitely do) that are damaging to the gut-lining. They also weaken the
    natural peristalsis and can cause dependency. So it interferes with the
    self-regulatory capability of the body...  
    Apart from this any supplement will push the body in a certain direction
    that the specific formula is created for. This is usually not the natural
    course of healing the body would take for itself. And since Biontology aims
    to get the body back to Self-Heal, after balancing the biophoton emission
    nothing else should be done to interfere with the body's own choices.

    3. Coffee enemas don't follow the natural procedure of intake and
    transformation of food and drink, so are not compatible with Biontology.
    When anything is inserted directly into the bowel, the digestive system is
    surpassed and both energetic and chemical transformation of substances does
    not happen before they are absorbed into the blood.
    Enemas can cause endorphin production and suppression, this will affect
    Self-Healing in a negative way.

    4. Homeopathic remedies, will disturb the finely balanced treatment of the
    Chiren, so are not compatible with Biontology.
    Homeopathic remedies contain information that will direct the body to a
    certain action. Since in Biontology every remedy is measured, and the dose
    is filtered due to the Biophoton resonance filter, the newly offered
    information (homeopathic pellet/drop) at best won't do anything and at
    worst will disturb the Biophoton Coherence that the Chiren treatment has
    caused... When you measure coherence in all systems, you should leave the
    body alone for some time to allow it to heal.
    The same is true for other energetic remedies (Bush and Bach drops!) or
    objects (crystals!). Especially stones can block progress and cause severe
    energetic disturbances, which makes one especially sensitive to Spin
    Inversion.

    5. Vitamin supplements are not a natural food source and are not compatible
    with Biontology.
    Vitamins stripped from their natural source are potentially as dangerous as
    other refined products. Their action in the body can be very harmful,
    especially in large doses.
    Another problem is that vitamins are usually produced synthetically and as
    such not much better than pharmaceuticals. But even when they are not, this
    high a dose is unnatural by itself. In nature a body would never get a dose
    like this. In unrefined food sources, there is a harmony between all
    elements (vitamins, minerals, plant-chemicals, protein, carbohydrates,
    fiber... etc.)
    Johan has worked with biochemist Ralph Kryzak in the 80's and learned from
    him that high doses of vitamin C cause the destruction of brain cells....

    6. Oxy-mag is not compatible with Biontology...
    See previous answers, it is unnatural and might damage intestinal flora.

    7. Thermography is just an non-invasive thermal imaging method, so it is
    compatible with Biontology.
    Nothing is energetically or chemically done to the body to create a thermal
    image, so there's absolutely no harm in this.

    Karolina, thanks for this thorough information. It provides me back-up as I
    discuss their use of these remedies and devices. Most have been so ill for
    so long that they keep adding more and more therapies in the hope that "the
    total is greater than each part." I find I spend half of the session
    listening and slowly redirecting their dependence on so many therapies. And
    this information will be quite helpful for those that are still fearful of
    changing.

    hello Jiri and Karolina,

    Recently I attended a Mind Body Spirit expo show at our local convention
    center. Scalar Energy Products (www.nesianfusion.com) was selling Lava
    Pendants as a natural energy generating device. The brochure says, " The
    active ingredients inside the pendant are composed of 76 different minerals
    that were extracted from volcanic rocks and then recombined with tourmaline
    using nano-technology and heat infusion methods. The pendant works by
    radiating natural scalar energy which enters the body of the wearer and
    gets distributed to areas in need of energy balance and causes a natural
    grounding effect." 

    I struggle a lot with EMF loads and they say this blocks the EMF's. Even as
    I treat people, the EMF's from my neighbors pelt down on my brain and
    muddle my thinking. 

    I put a pendant on at the show and could definitely feel the energy of it
    going through my body. But this particular pendant was too much for me like
    trying to put a race car engine in an old run down VW bus (me). 

    I haven't yet tried the electro-smog remedies offered in the Chiren, but I
    do wonder about scalar energy and if it is compatible. The rep told me that
    a Naturopathic Doctor in Washington who had the Chrien was also using her
    pendant to treat/protect clients along with the chiren.

    Is it safe? or not compatible.

    Barbara: 
    See answer 4: "The same is true for other energetic remedies or objects
    (e.g. stones!)"
    This is not something that is either approved, nor tested by us. This
    Naturopathic doctor is not in line with the Biontology protocol. The IABS
    has never trained a practitioner in Washington or sold a Chiren there, so
    it sounds a bit strange to me...
    Johan has never found any energetically charged object or crystal that was
    beneficial to the body. Quite the opposite, usually they disrupt the Aura
    and Hormonal System, Heart and Circulation. Crystals should always be taken
    of during treatments. When they supposedly change symptoms for the better,
    this is because of suppression, people don't feel they are sick anymore.
   
    The fact that you felt like "...trying to put a race car engine in an old
    run down VW bus (me)" shows that there was a stress response of your body.
    This is not a good thing, it is what we sometimes call "Gallbladder
    energy".
     

    Jiri:
    The best results with Biontology are always achieved in clients that don't
    do anything apart from their Chiren treatment and sometimes some
    environmental and lifestyle changes. 

    1 & 4  See point 3 and 5 in my previous answer. 

    2 & 3  Both therapies offer an stressful external condition to the body
    that it has to adapt to. More stress does not combine with Biontology. Mind
    that clients might claim to feel relaxed after these procedures, but that
    is what Endorphins do... 
    Not a good combo with Biontology, where we want the body to relax and rest
    in order to heal.
   
    Note that it is not our intention to put a lot of pressure on clients to
    stop everything. This too has to be a natural unfolding in the therapy.
    Usually when people start to feel improvement and trust you, you can talk
    about a lot of things without having to convince.
    You can also ask a client to stop all these things they do temporarily, for
    the couple of weeks of treatment. When symptoms are gone, the need to
    search for all kind of solutions stops...

What is the current procedure for becoming certified? Do we present 10 cases?
If so when and to whom?

    Hi Toril,

    The certification program is going to be announced in the coming "Lightnet"
    that Johan is sending out. The cases that you have to work on will be
    reviewed by Johan himself and because this is going to be a lot of work we
    decided to reduce the amount of case-studies required to 5. 
    Only one of those cases should be about a child, the others should be all
    adults. 

    But more about this all in the "Lightnet"

    Hi I Denmark we havent heard about any certification program, when we
    joined the course. I certainly hope we recive a diploma after the course.
    Amongst many things it is importend to clients and to authorities, that we
    run a legal buisness

    Hi Margit,

    Lightnet is a mailing that Johan sometimes sends out to update all
    practitioners and students on what is new. Lillia is working very hard with
    Johan to update all mailing lists so problems like you experienced won't
    occur anymore in the future. To make sure that you're on the list you can
    mail Lillia: LSlemmons@iabs-us.com

    The certification program is something that is beginning this year and that
    was created to protect the quality of Biontology. It is our way to make
    sure practitioners follow the protocol Johan developed over the years. We
    have gotten a lot of feedback from clients that have received incomplete
    treatments, supplementation protocols, strange alterations in the treatment
    procedure, or just too many treatments for the condition they're in without
    seeing the promised results. 

    Of course we also offer guidance through this forum and additional
    training. The certification should be seen as a challenge to get the best
    out of the Chiren. If Biontology is perceived by clients as a reliable
    source of treatment and they have good results this is in everybody's best
    interest.

    Yes, when everything is in place and it is clear to all the practitioners
    what is expected from them as Biontologists, there will be communication if
    we receive complaints. We just introduced the new website that explains to
    clients how Biontology works and also have an office in California where
    people can reach us if they have questions. So we only just started to
    receive this kind of feedback... 

    Since it might be because of a lack of understanding from the new
    practitioners, we are first going to clarify what the protocol is before we
    take action. This page however already explains part of it:

    Hi Liselotte,

    I'm sorry you didn't get a response in the past, but things have been
    chaotic and Johan had many tasks to do and did everything himself. Now
    there is an organisation, things are going to change, but there's still a
    lot of work to do for all of us to create more professionalism.

    The diploma is something different then the new certification. It might be
    nice to have, since it shows you have done the course, but this new
    certification means true recognition as a Biontologist by the IABS. It
    shows clients that you practice Johan's specific therapy and adhere to the
    protocols. This is going to make Biontology a more reliable source of
    treatment for people to turn to in the future. Right now if two friends
    were to go to two different practitioners they would tell each other
    completely different stories afterwards. 

    News about the new certificate program will be announced in the Lightnet.
    I'm sorry you have to wait for that.

HIV+ & Diagnosis ALS on HIV Meds.

janjan
March 2013 edited February 2014 in Medication Flag
Client:  
HIV+ and now also diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gherigs)
He wants to come for treatment because of the success with a client I'm
currently treating for ALS (can raise his arm and pick up a heavy bottle now,
and is making muscles rather than declining muscle) and also because of my
other ALS clients improvements.

He has been on these drugs (description below) that are managing his HIV. 
I asked if they were immuno-suppressents and he asked his doctor who said HIV
HAART medicine is not considered immuno-suppressent.

Questions: 
1) Do you think there is any danger to him if I treat while he is on these
medications? I am not sure I understand all the action of what he is on, and he
will stay on these. 
2) I think his ALS symptoms may be clearly related to the HIV so, of course it
is necessary to just treat what shows up, but.. will he then express all the
illness he has "under control" as we are moving through it all in treating?  
Will I possibly activate something or trigger a response they are keeping under
control by boosting his immune system and activating his system that he may be
content just keeping under control? 


The medication he is on are: Truvada and Isentress 

Isentress blocks and enzyme which the virus (HIV) needs in order to make more
virus. 
The enzyme that Isentress blocks is called HIV integrase. When used with other
Anti-virals, Insentress may do two things: 
1) Reduce the amount of HIV in your blood. This is called your viral load. 
2) Increase the number of white cells called CD4 (T) cells.

Truvada can treat people who are infected with HIV by lowering the amount of
virus in their bodies and slowing down the progression of the disease. 
In healthy, uninfected people, the drug can thwart HIV’s ability to take hold
in healthy cells and start an infection, by blocking the activity of an enzyme
that the virus needs to replicate.

TRUVADA is a type of medicine called a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase
inhibitor (NRTI) that is used to treat HIV-1 infection in adults and teenagers
(12 and older).
TRUVADA is a combination therapy because it has 2 medicines in 1 pill– EMTRIVA®
(emtricitabine) and VIREAD®(tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). TRUVADA is always
used with other anti-HIV medicines to treat HIV-1 infection because TRUVADA
alone is not a complete treatment.
HIV infects important cells for fighting infection called CD4 cells, or T
cells. Once HIV enters the body, the virus multiplies inside these cells. These
new viruses are released into the blood and infect other CD4 cells.
When used with another anti-HIV-1 medicine, TRUVADA helps make it harder for
HIV-1 to multiply by blocking an enzyme in your body called reverse
transcriptase
By helping to keep HIV-1 from multiplying in your body, TRUVADA helps lower the
viral load, which means decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood
TRUVADA may also help increase the number of CD4 cells when used with another
anti-HIV-1 medicine

Thank you for any help.

    Hi Jan,

    HIV test is an antibody test and is positve to about 20 types of infections
    so the ALS could definitely be related. There is no such thing as an HIV
    virus.

    HAART treatments are preventative anti retro viral treatments but it has
    been proven that HIV was not a retrovirus. So I believe as these are
    preventative, there is no need for him to take them.

    But what are his ALS symptoms?

    T cells also get increased tremendoulsy if people move in an environment
    that is rich in negative ions. Negative ions also reduce the infections.

    Thank you, he has decided to go forward with treatments and most likely go
    off the medication gradually. 

    He was in very bad shape, very low T-cell count until he took this
    medication and then his T-cells are now back to normal.  So clearly he is
    trepaditious about stopping but will consider it.  He too feels, as you and
    I do, that his "ALS" as diagnosed by the mayo clinic in minnesota, and in
    LA may not be ALS,  but part of this whole syndrome he has. So we will
    begin treatments next week.  

    Symptoms he briefly described on the phone are severe declining muscular
    weakness which I have read is also part of this whole HIV syndrome that
    many have which is a form of lactic acidosis. I just read this.. that in
    some cases it is caused by the medication... 
    "Nucleoside analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) especially
    stavudine, used for the treatment of HIV infection have been rarely
    associated with lactic acidosis syndrome (LAS) and severe neuromuscular
    weakness mimicking Guillain Barre syndrome." 
   
    He is in a "safe relationship", not a drug user and practices safe sex.
    Hopefully that means a condom, as I have listened to your discussions about
    the bodily fluids (proteins) being introduced into "other" areas and having
    detrimental or  toxic effects.

    Question:
    If it is lactic acidosis and he is experiencing severe muscle degeneration
    due to this (Liver, Testes?) Is it on the Liver I might see this muscular
    decline the most? Along with all the myriad of other things that will show
    all over?
   
    I will let you know how this progresses, once I know more about it, and all
    his symptoms. His first treatment is next week, then 4 days later then
    weekly.

    Looking forward to your help if needed.

    As far as the low T cells are concerned: Try to treat it with negative ion
    generators in his environment. 
   
    There are or were, negative ion generators that you could hang around your
    neck. If he does this, the effect might be very positive. 
    The solar activity also has a strong influence on the number of T cells. In
    cases of solar storms or solar flares, the number of T cells in the body
    will drop drastically. The solar wind brings mainly positive ions to earth,
    so negative ions will do the opposite.
   
    Positive ions also are the cause of many inflammations and infections. I
    feel the lactic acidosis is an effect on the muscles directly and not
    necessarily of the Liver. But I do not know. Treating with Intestinal Flora
    might also be beneficial.

March 2015 - Measuring Remedies On Points That Do Not Drop

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Q&A Flag
Question
Someone told me that when a point does not drop, and then I measure a remedy on
this point and it still does not drop, that this means the body wants the
remedy. I was not able to find any reference on the forum or in the manual that
explained this procedure. Can you please elaborate on this?

Answer
There is no point at all in measuring on points that do not drop and still
don’t drop with a certain remedy. This procedure shows that you are focusing on
remedies and do NOT listen to the body at all. It is the world upside down. The
exact opposite of how one should assess and treat. One should only treat what
shows up AND treat it in the right order.

For example: EVEN when the Liver does show itself, a remedy that DOES correct
the drops should not always be used. It all depends on the condition of the
rest of the body. This is what Biontology is, taking a helicopter view on the
functioning of all the organ systems with an understanding on how they
interact.

When a remedy does not cause a drop, this does not mean anything at all. It
only means that the body does not react to it. It does not mean that the remedy
will not lead to overdose. It does not mean that there is or isn’t resonance.
But especially it does not mean that there is a need for this remedy.

    Concerning the paragraph: "For example:..."   Are you alluding to this,
    specifically for the Liver or just using it as an example.  I understand, I
    think, that using, for instance Medorrhinum on the Large Intestine,  which
    in practice is NOT a Large intestine remedy, would be an error.  In other
    words, remedies that are not common to a pathway, even though they may fix
    a drop, are to be discarded ?...

    That "For example..." paragraph is explaining  the importance of treating
    in the correct order. 
    Why we look at the body as a whole and not just focus on remedies that fit.
   
    So in this example Karolina points out that with our "helicopter view" we
    look at the condition of the whole body and detect whether the other organs
    are even ready to help detox the Liver, and in many cases it is not, so
    then we would not choose a Liver remedy even if it does corrects a point on
    the Liver.
   
    The question she is answering is totally different from what you are
    sidetracking to.
    Here it was important to explain why it isn't a good idea to try to fit
    remedies on points that are already straight.
    Our focus shouldn't be fixed on remedies like this "remedy-witch-hunt"
    described in this question, but on the understanding of the workings of the
    body, so you can find out what is needed.
   
    So your question doesn't connect to what she is writing.
    you want to just know if you can use remedies that do fix points on 
    meridians even if they are not "meant" for those meridians.
    Ofcourse you can, the danger is only that the treatment might become
    chaotic if we just randomly try everything everywhere, it is important to 
    have an understanding of what we do and try, and not just randomly do or
    try. 
   
    Not everyone can be sure of their measurements or understanding yet and it
    is much easier to develop a good foundation when we are familiar enough
    with the meridians, their interactions and remedies.
    When we become familiar with their interactions, it becomes easier to
    collect information and find those "other" remedies.
    In the manual it only states to try certain remedies first on certain
    points/meridians. 
    I doesn't state to try those only... ;)

    Put some Gallbadder remedies in and see if more drops appear. Suppression
    might be the problem. Atropinum, Billiary Chirrose or Cholesystitis is
    worth a try because his symptoms. Remedies like Herpes and Mezereum,
    Luesinum,  Engystol you can see if match on the drops, In a nosode book I
    read that Bact Proteus can be measured along, but without an explication of

    Instead of the Herpes I would try Variolinum and/or Varicellen. It has a
    far better effect.

    I have no idea what "hell burning" is. Please explain.

    If the pains are in his Large Intestines, the problem is often the
    Gallbladder, caused by gas formation. It could also be Appendicitis, but
    you have not measured this.

    With google it is easy to find a translation in English for words you don't

    Hellburning / helvetesild is Shingles in English. And this is Varicellen/
    Herpes Zoster.

    In treatment this condition reacts best on Variolinum.

    You can also treat locally with the Scar Treatment with only this remedy in
    the slot (so don't put a whole series of remedies in there, the treatment
    will be less effective…) 
    Remember though that whatever you put in a Scar Treatment will affect the
    whole body, so count it as 1 nosode when you also do a Hand and Footplate
    Treatment.

Different Action Of Remedies In Footplates/Hand Rods?

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
October 2014 edited October 2014 in Q&A Flag
Queston:
Since Homaccords have a bigger depth with less remedies in more different
potencies I intuitively prefer to put them in the hand treatment together with
the nosodes instead of in the dyslexia footplate session with the other support
remedies. They seem to work deeper that way. What is your opinion about this?

Answer by Johan:
High potencies correlate with information that travels on higher frequencies.
To get the full scope of effect of these remedies, the treatment should be
without frequency filter. Only the final two steps in the >12 years program
allow the higher frequencies to go through, but these steps filter the lower
frequencies out.
The dyslexia program is without frequency filter throughout the whole
treatment. So using the Homaccords on the footplates would expose the body
longer to the higher potencies. However I have not seen much difference in
results, whether you put the remedies in the footplate treatment or in the hand
rod treatment. With the homeopathic information it is more important THAT you
offer the information, than HOW LONG you offer this information. This, by the
way, is also the reason why I advise against using remedies in local treatments
in combination with the normal Biontology sessions. Overdosing is a real
concern, and I cannot warn you enough about this.
The length of treatment and the steps with the filters have more to do with the
effectiveness of the biophoton treatment itself than with the effectiveness of
the remedies. It is important to understand that remedies are an ADDITION and
not the treatment itself. The treatment is with your own filtered light and
inverted light disturbances.

    Thank you for clarifying about the effectiveness of the remedies and making
    the distinction ones more between the basic biophoton treatment and the
    remedies added. That is very helpfull.

    But I get a bit confused on two points:

    1 - I have understood from what you said before that there a 4 filters in
    the >12 program. And that one by one these filters are taken away during
    the program alowing higher frequencies through. By the end of the treatment
    there would be no filters and all frequencies would pass (just like during
    the 2-8 year program and the dyslectia program that has no filters). Now
    you are saying that the last two steps of the >12 program actually leaves
    out the lower frequencies. What is true?

    2 - Even though the remedies can basically be transferred through any
    program as you explained above, you always emphasize to use Nosodes
    primarily in the main hand treatment and not in the dyslectia treatment. Is
    that now merely because of the practical reason that we can still correct
    and support the body in the dyslectia treatment if the nosodes have created
    some disbalance or burden in the body? Or do the nosode still have a
    distinct stronger/better effect given in de main hand treatment?

    1. No this is not correct, there are 5 filters in the adult program and one
    by one a filter replaces another. I must admit that I (and probably many
    others) have misunderstood this too in the past and I am glad we can get
    this out of the way. 
    For me it puts the adult program in a complete different light. It offers
    the light frequencies in packages, so the body is slowly prepared for the
    higher frequencies in the last two steps, but when you add them all up
    there is not more exposure to the remedies and light than during the 2-7
    years program!

    * However, the steps in the adult program are VERY necessary for adults to
    prevent unwanted reactions. The adult body needs to be approached
    differently than the body of a child.

    2. The emphasis to use Nosodes primarily in the hand treatment is not
    because of a difference in the effect of offering the remedy to the body in
    different programs. This is solely because of the logical steps in your
    treatment.The first thing you do is always: measure, find causes, establish
    your focus and find the Nosodes that balance these points/meridians. 
    To solve an issue, the cause needs to be addressed with Nosodes, so the
    hand treatment, which always comes first is often filled with many Nosodes.
    (and if not, then they are not needed in the footplate treatment either…you
    would have found them before). 
    Because there needs to be a balance between Nosodes and Supports and you
    have to take care not to overdose on Nosodes there can never be a lot of
    Nosodes on the footplates. 

    Your fear of Nosodes creating a imbalance in the body is unnecessary,
    because when there is no resonance anymore, the Nosode will not be taken by
    the body anymore either, so you cannot overdose time wise as far as the
    offering of a remedy is concerned. 

    Overdosing means: Using too many remedies OR too many light treatments

    Overdosing does NOT mean: Using a remedy too long => the light filters will
    prevent any imbalance in the light that a remedy may cause, so when the
    beneficial working is over any possible negative effect that the remedy
    then may cause will be cancelled out.

Kidneys and Intestinal Flora

Jennifer IveyJennifer Ivey
April 2015 edited May 2015 in Therapy Questions Flag
I was treating a client today:

1. I treated the Hormonal System and Circulation 
2. I had two slots left for Kidney nosodes => Measurement: Kidney (R) -
Salmonella and Kidney (L) - Bact. Proteus
I was a little conflicted as I had read that it is best to use all of the the
Flora remedies when you need one. 
3. I ended up putting a Gallbladder remedy in instead of the Bact. Pro for the
Kidney(L) and moved it and the other Intestinal Flora remedies to the
Footplates together with other supports. 
4. All kidney drops were cleared in the final measurement as a result. I also
included Solidago, by the way.

Question:
Did I make the correct choice, by moving Bact Proteus nosode to the footplates
and using a Gallbladder remedy in the hand treatment?

    Thank you Maggie, for making me aware that this question was overlooked.
    This unfortunately happens sometimes even though I often scroll through the
    questions to see if I missed something.
    It is actually a very good question concerning the protocol.

    Answer:
    You want to limit your focus on Organ Systems. You have your focus on 3
    systems (Hormone System, Circulation, Kidneys) already, so treating the
    Gallbladder would be too early. 
    Also you should preferably not use more nosodes than 8. In this case Bact.
    Proteus is found on the Kidneys, which means there is a bacterial infection
    and the action of the Flora remedy is that of a Nosode and thus should be
    counted as one of the 8. The Flora remedies that you then add, without them
    showing up in measurement, could be considered support and can be put on
    the footplates.

    Another thing you should be aware of is that a Kidney infection with
    Intestinal Flora, shows that there is a big problem with the Large
    Intestine and that the Large Intestine is higher up the list of the
    Treatment Protocol than the Gallbladder. So focussing on the Gallbladder
    viewed from this perspective again would be too soon. 

    When you find that a Nosode (in this case Bact. Proteus), matches the Organ
    System of your focus (in this case the Kidneys), you should just go ahead
    and use it and not swop it out for something else. There is no need for it.

Treating a Baby

CecilieCecilie
May 2013 edited May 2013 in Interesting Cases Flag
I have seen several questions on this subject, so I'd like to share my own
experience with treating my Baby.

My youngest (4th) child was born when I already worked with the Chiren. He is
now 10 months old and has never had any Vaccination or anything else but Chiren
treatment.

Result of the Chiren treatments:
* After the Whiplash Treatment (when 2 days old) a kind of "peace and harmony"
came over him that I have never seen before or after
* Baby never has/had Stomach cramps no matter what I eat. When breast feeding I
don't have to avoid food (e.g. onion) like I had to with the other children.
* Baby easily falls asleep and sleeps very well
* Baby is almost never sick
* Baby is "the most harmonic and happy child people have ever seen" =
observation by many people and then they ask me how I did this ;-)
* Baby even smiles or makes happy sounds when just waking up...  

So if I had the Chiren before. I would have treated all of my children from day
1 :-)

    Still unclear about the breast point...if the pineal or pititary is at the
    "junction Joint", you go on up the hand to the "head of the bone" is that
    right behind the knuckle where the pituitary is.  In other words is the
    pituitary on one side of the joint and the breast point on the other side
    of the joint?

    Thanks....

    Thanks Yelyena!

    I assume you mean the manual. I just did look it up on the TW chart page  (
    no page 91 in my book) and it does say mammary gland there.

      I  haven't looked in it (the manual) for some time as I thought it was no
    longer applicable in so many areas. 
    It also says the thymus is there above the mammary gland but we have it now
    as on the L triple warmer between the parathyroid and insulin point.  
     When there are discrepancies like this I will go to the new charts we have
    been sent. I really appreciate you pointing this out, it makes it clearer.

    PS  I am sending you someone from the big Island - (johnette- a special

    I'm sorry.... I'm not fast enough in answering everything. 

    Don't use the old manual for determining the breast points. When you go
    over the knuckle, you continue to follow the bone until the next joint. So
    it is way up the body of the hand..... and not just over the knuckle behind
    the Pituitary or Pineal. 

    The old charts are drawn after Voll's ideas, but Johan has found different
    correlations that he has been using for many years now with success. So I
    choose to follow these... 

    Jan: what you have seen in the old Voll maps as Thymus is the point you
    have to use as Breast Point (only the glandular part of the breast though).

    Sorry, Still confused about the Breast point!

    1. Never heared about it. I also posted a case with a women who has Breast
    cancer. I understood to measure Carcinoma Mammae, Mastopathie and
    Mammacystica on the Thyroid (in case it is a fibroid) or Circulation (if it
    is or was a cyst) - then look at Adrenals, Gallbladder and Heart. So it is
    better to measure these on the Breast Point ?


    2. Where is the Breast point located ? Between Pituitary and Thymus /
    Pineal and Thymus ? On the same line?


    3. Do we have a new manual with a Breast Point?


    4. The women with Breast cancer I treat has always, always drops on the
    Thymus. Tried to balance with Selenium and Little Flannel Flower (according
    to protocol) Never works. But after the Treatment, no drop on Thymus
    (Doen’t know what other point / remedy balances it). No I’m confused if the
    point that I measure as Thymus is the Breast Point ? Sorry to ask, it is
    very well described by Karolina, but maybe its my language problem.. A
    chart would be very helpful.

    Hi Alexandra, don't worry... asking is good, since if you haven't
    understood it, others might not have either. It is a bit difficult in words
    without a drawing...

    1. Two things are confused here:
    * Identifying whether the Breast Cancer is a Fibrous Tumor or a Cyst is
    done by measuring with Myom Uteri for the first and Mamma Cystica for the
    last, on the Breast Point (Triple Warmer) or on the Degeneration Meridian.
    * Then when you've identified the Cause of the Cancer you can work on it,
    because you know that Cysts are caused by bad Circulation and that Fibroid
    Tumors are cause by a failing Thyroid.
    * The Cancer Remedies themselves will most likely not measure on Thyroid or
    Circulation, since the Cancer is caused by the problems in these Systems,
    but not the other way around (the Thyroid problem is not caused by the
    Mammary Tumor)

    2. No the Breast Point is located on the back of the hand (body of the
    hand, not the fingers), if you follow the bone proximal of (above) the
    upper joint (knuckle) and then hit the joint almost in the middle of the
    hand, this is the Breast Point.
   
    3. No I it is not in the Manual. If you would have Voll maps it would be
    the Thymus point on there (do not confuse this with the Thymus point the
    way you've learned in Biontology!)
   
    4. See point 3.... the Thymus point you have been measuring is correct, it
    is not the Breast Point that is talked about above.
    In my experience, when this point is not corrected with Little Flannel
    Flower or Selenium, it often corrects when the Gallbladder is balanced on
    the Feet....

    Perhaps you could only treat locally without activating the Pituitary (=
    activating the immune function).

    Client:
    => has titanium plates instead of L5 in his spine and cadaver knee tendon.
    => did not take immunosuppressants (did not take any drugs after surgery).)
     
   
    I have not even measured him but it would be interesting to see how far the
    body can go without active immune system.

    Symptoms:
    Almost complete loss of voice
    Muscle weakness on the left side of his tongue
    His symptoms are worst after meals (still Liver controls Stomach).

    Question:
    1. Does the body not reject metal but does reject cadaver tendon? 
    2. Could the weak muscle in the tongue be caused by Liver toxicity?
    3. Does tongue belongs to Stomach? 
    4. Have you had experience with treating the person without activation of
    Pituitary?  
    5. Sorry, I mainly wanted to ask if we can treat a person with cadaver
    tendon who did not take immuno-supressants after surgery...

    I would advise not to treat someone who has a cadaver tendon. I have no
    actual experience with it, but the connection between the animal tendon and
    the body's own tendon can create a problem… Better safe than sorry.

    1. Metal is never rejected, cadaver parts can create problems.
    2. This is hard to say, you can measure where the problems are but without
    treatment the Liver usually does not show itself anyway.
    3. Yes, but the muscles of the tongue are also controlled by the Liver/
    Gallbladder
    4. Local treatment is OK, I would not treat in any other way.
    5. No, this is a contra-indication

    This discussion has been centered around someone who begins Chiren
    treatments AFTER having a cadaver tendon graft.

    What about someone who has had many Chiren treatments over time and already
    has a fully functioning pituitary and hormone system PRIOR to receiving the
    graft?

    In that situation, it seems as if the body would do one of two things;
    1. Reject the graft immediately after surgery because the discrimination
    center is functioning and it recognizes the foreign entity.
    2. Not reject the graft in which case additional Chiren treatments would
    not suddenly cause the immune system to start working (since it was already
    working).

    Question: Would a cadaver graft in someone with the above described
    situation be a candidate for additional Chiren treatments?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    June 2014 edited June 2014 Flag
    If someone had already treatments prior to receiving the graft, the
    hormonal system should function. And if there was no negative response to
    the graft further treatments are possible.

    I believe the body would want to reject the bone but in all likelihood
    cannot because the new bone is secured by metal.

    The question is also how the body would react to dead material in the long
    run.
    The body is likely to encapsulate the dead bone over years just like this
    happens with silicon implants.

Collapse, Dehydration, Shivering

Beate
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Psychology Flag
To make a long story short:

Client: Female 54 full time work and is driven by an inner drive to fix
everything in life.(her mother and her 3 sisters all the same). 
High shivers run in the family.
Measured her on off for years, she is a friend.
Always better after Chiren, especially Whiplash treatment (" feel clear in my
head").
She has had lots of other treatments in between, diets and doctors.
Jumping from one thing to another in high gear....,

She does not drink much, and has been proud somehow of not needing more then a
half cup water a day....always!
"none in my family need to drink much"

Now, the last weeks, she could not sleep at all. Shivering inside her body and
hyper .
She emailed me about this, I am still in Spain.

She collapsed last week in Oslo and got hospitalized, dehydrated.
I have seen this developing in her and her sisters the last 10 years.
In total denial abot several things.
It does not matter what othef people say, onely one truth about certaun
things...
You get used to it:))

Everything must be perfect and in order. The diagnoses is ME so far from a
doctor last week.

Since this is a friend I love, it makes me sad to hear her saying : " beate now
I am sick, and I get energized jjust thinking of how you can help with Chiren.(
she has denied beeing sick) there are " no real sick people in the family"

The doctor had to give her betablocks, and then she can sleep and relax...and
then a new tablet and off she went 10 km. Skiing, walking and driving her car
long distane....

But what she actually does, then is to speed up her daily activities AGAIN...
The downward spiral. As usual:)

This is one of my dearest and loving friends and I feel sad.
I am afraid she will get cancer.

My question to anybody out there... What is your experience ?
How can I help her , and how to know if it is right?
Thank you , Beate.

    Now she is worse and yesterday she had full program all day.

    She got nauseous, and felt strange while she was working using her
    body....and when finally home after work ..
    (she had to see what happened in the office), and after all the other
    things she tells she think it was too much. She is a social worker, you
    might have guessed already .

    I have measured and treated her in between, for years 1-3 treatments, and
    then nothing for 6 months.
    She always feels better....however as we know, some of us need to keep the
    gestalt in pain.

    This is a deep psychological issue, that has surfaced and escalated. the
    new tests from her doctor has still not arrived she tells.

    There is a drive not to be allowed to rest and feel good. There is no doubt
    her Adrenal Glands are exhausted. 

    Question: How do you use the Chiren with a person in this condition, who
    take beta blocks medication and jump from one therapy to the other, and who
    is your best friend you love?

    Regarding Beate's last question here (maybe belongs in another area)... I
    have some clients who are my closest friends, too. It's the same for me as
    any other area of our lives. There will always be things you don't exactly
    admire about someone, even when you love them dearly (just as they feel
    about me for sure, too). One has to accept ALL there is and just love the
    person fully, do whatever you feel is in your power to do, and then let
    them run with it. In my experience, it is better to just accept people for
    who they are, unless they are intentionally doing something to hurt you!
    The majority of people are brainwashed and medically-oriented - especially
    in the U.S. -  and there isn't a lot one can do about it IF they don't
    listen to you. For me, the Chiren (with enough time) can open a person
    AFTER you have filled them with the light and they have taken it in - to
    then be able to talk to them in a way where they finally listen (but
    usually they just start talking about how they feel they have changed -
    with their feelings, too!). I believe that each time we 'remove' an
    obstacle in someone's energetic body, the body does respond and then the
    emotional heart gets stronger and we can be vulnerable without fear. For
    me, the Chiren removed fear big time. Suddenly, one day something happens
    and you don't feel any anxiety about it... like me with flying. I knew I
    was afraid of it, and didn't fly from 1996 until I flew twice in less than
    one month to finally meet all of you and be in Walnut Creek. The fear
    vanished. I credit the Chiren 100% for this. And I am SO grateful for this!

    Dear Kathryn, I have read your feedback several times. And you are right in
    many things :)

    I do feel a bit hurt when the results from my treatments somehow become
    semipermiable...... wanish half way out of her system./head ...even when
    feeling good and sorted out after the sessions. (Old stuff in me, about
    noot beeing seen)

    Often when my friend and me meet socially she talks about the kiropractor,
    the acupuncturist, the physical therapist, the raw food, a workshop how to
    handle things and a MD spescialist and so on.

    To be honest I do accept this , but I have no need to let myself be drawn
    into this spiral. I feel I need to say no to further treatments. Simply
    telling that working with several energy healing tings at one time is
    disturbing the healing direction of her body.I know the frustration of
    beeing ill, believe me. However each person need to stop and reorientate to
    get another result then before.

    So you live in Walnut Creek? I have beeen there many times, when I studied
    at Berkley for two years back then :)
    Thank you very much for spending your time.

    (Karolina: This is a personal response to Beate - and has nothing to do
    with the title...Not sure where to put this. Should I be responding
    personally to Beat's email instead?)

    Thank you Beate. Very kind. And no...I wish! I live in Miami. I flew to CA
    (grew up in Laguna Beach) to meet with Johan in Nov. and again in Dec. for
    the Refresher Course -- the highlight of the entire education for me. 

    I do understand. If someone is getting all kinds of treatments here and
    there, it's the same as taking a lot of supplements or medications. As
    Johan says, the body gets confused when there is too much information
    coming in all the time. Less is more, he keeps repeating. And he is so
    right.

    I love that you clearly understand the feeling of 'not being seen' and how
    that affects you personally when someone talks about all the other
    so-called healers. But keep in mind, this feeling might have something to
    do with comparing yourself to others. My mother told me (when I admitted I
    envied my big sister who was so gorgeous), that each time I compared myself
    to her, I was wiping out a part of myself. She asked me if I wanted TO BE
    my sister, and of course my No was emphatic. But she was so right. The
    minute you compare yourself to anyone else, you diminish yourself.
    Hmmm...could this be a lack of self-esteem? I sure do remember that one! 

    Love and Light. Your feedback has been enormous for me, too. I always look
    forward to whatever your comments are. Thank you so much.

BPA - Bisphenol A

Candace Hsiao Young
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Toxins Flag
Is there any nosode to counteract the harm from the chemical BPA, or will
treatment of Hormonal System correct this?

Comments

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    We usually do not need a remedy for every specific toxin. The body is
    capable of excreting BPA by itself when it is healthy. Restoring the
    hormone system and detoxifying functions will optimise this process. 

    If, however, there was a known "overdose" of BPA that may have been
    causative in the development of the specific ailment of a client, I would
    make a remedy. BPA intake can for example be too much for the body to
    handle if a person drinks a lot from plastic, BPA containing bottles that
    were left in the sun or were microwaved.

    As far as I know there is no properly prepared homeopathic remedy of BPA
    available. The pellets that are on the market are quite useless.

    This is how I would make the remedy: 
    1. Find a bottle that you are sure of that it contains BPA. 
    2. Put water in the bottle
    3. Leave the bottle out in the sun or in another way exposed to heat (in
    the car in the summer for example). 
    4. Use the BPA containing water to create a remedy with the neutralisation
    program, or dillute and potentize according to homeopathic principles up to
    D12 and higher.

    Great, thanks. Does BPA also leach out if someone drinks from a frozen

    March 2015 edited April 2015 Flag
    Toxins can only dissolve in fluids. So as long as water is not in it's
    fluid form the BPA will not go into solution. To drink something that is
    frozen it first needs to become fluid, the moment you thaw the drink it can
    absorb BPA... How else do you want to drink "frozen" water? 
    Drinking cold water and eating ice is not so great for you body anyway...

    Agree this is a bad use of water. Many people do this in the summer to keep
    their water cold on hikes, etc.

    If a person is in Whiplash, the Parathyroid, thyroid and other items will
    drop.  Does this mean that these items, glands, organs that are under the
    influence of the whiplash, not functioning well, or are these drops a kind
    of false reading, that is, are they actually function OK but the whiplash
    is falsifying the reading.  Or said another way, if under the influence of
    a whiplash is the thyroid and parathyroid functioning poorly due to the
    whiplash or are they actually OK but the whiplash is tricking the reading.?

    A whiplash is a disturbance to those glands and causes them to function
    improperly.

Support on the Footplates

    Hi, I just wanted to point out that the protocol in my manual suggests
    using viscum, thalamus, and cerebrum in foot plates during first treatment
    and few nosodes. Since my beginner class, I have been relying heavily on
    the protocol in manual and have been told recently that it may not be
    correct. Is there a correct, older version of the measurement protocol you
    can post somewhere for the community to check against? Thanks so much.
  •

    The reason why it is mentioned in the Protocol that they can be used the
    first time as support is kind of a compromise to people who had learned it
    the wrong way and were accustomed to use them always. It only makes sense
    to use these remedies when the Hormone Glands that they support drop during
    the assessment. 

    Now I think it is confusing, especially to new students, and without enough
    explanation. When I created the protocol a couple of years ago there was
    nothing, and no one knew how to start. This guideline has been a great help
    to many, but I know I can do better ;-) Time is a problem for me though. 

    I just finished writing a book with thorough explanations of all the
    remedies, since this was also very much needed. One step at a time…

    So to answer your question: It is not necessary to put these remedies in,
    but they can be helpful if the organ systems they support drop.
   
    In general:

    Cerebrum => supports Nervous System
    Thalamus => supports Pineal Gland
    Viscum => supports Pituitary Gland

Primary Progressive Aphasia

Antoine
September 2015 edited September 2015 in Case Discussions - Student Flag
Hallo All, I am new here and unfortunately my very first client has a very
serious and officially incurable condition..
I am currently under training with Johan this week, but decided to post this
anyway to document the evolution of this case from the beginning. 
The next step for me is obviously to improve my measuring security. 

Client:
Woman

Diagnosis:
Primary progressive aphasia - LINK

1st Measurement:
Very few drops

Treatment:
Since I am still very insecure with the measurement, and had very few red
points, I proceeded with the following treatment.

1. Whiplash treatment
2. Standard Treatment with Hormone System remedies listed in the protocol

2nd Measurement:
No more drops

Treatment:
3. Appendicitis Necroticans, Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis, Bacterium
Coli, Bacterium Lactis, Bacterium Proteus, Bacterium Pyo, Candida

Explanation:
Focus on the Intestines, following Johan's insight that dementia is often
related to Appendicitis and lack of Intestinal Flora. 

Question
Any other advice on this case?

    Answer
    I think you should first measure again and report all the meridians that
    are dropping and the remedies that you find. This measurement is no good.
    There should be far more drops.

    Following the protocol is always the best but you must try to get accurate
    measurements. Then the correct remedies will show up.

    To introduce the bacteria to the Intestine is too soon as the Appendicitis
    is probably not cleared as yet. You can only find this out by measuring.

Delayed Effect in Measurement

TorilJelterTorilJelter
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Measurement Flag
Question:
Does it sometimes take time for the drops to correct after a Program?
Sometimes it seems like if I recheck drops immediately after a Program some
still drop, but if I wait a few minutes/seconds it "takes".

Example: today I treated a child with ADHD, Constipation, Cold. 

Measurement: Thyroid and Parathyroid points dropped as well as many others. 

Treatment: Whiplash Program. 

Immediately after the Parathyroid and Thyroid still seemed to drop. I checked
again and then those 2 drops were balanced and many others gone.

    Peter, certainly a possibility but I think for the most part my
    measurements are pretty good now and I have asked a 'senior' biontologist
    to verify this. I do have some people that have changing drops i.e. go in
    and out of Spin Inversion but more and more I find some consistency/pattern
    in my measurements in an individual client from session to session which
    makes me think mostly I'm doing OK.

Autistic Girl with Suicidal Tendencies

    Hi Chrystyne,

    You could try treating, based on symptoms, to see if she improves enough
    for you to take measurements in followup sessions.  However she may not be
    be willing to hold the rods long enough to do any good.  With a young child
    the mother might be able to wrap her hands around the child's hands. 
    However an out of control 15 year old could so some damage to you and your
    Chiren.

    You may want to reevaluate your boundaries and consider giving yourself
    permission not to treat certain clients especially if your physical safety
    is going to be placed in jeopardy.  I do believe that there are times that,
    as much as we want to help, we simply must let go.
  •

    Hi Chrystyne,

    I agree with Renate about allowing yourself to consider not treating
    certain clients.

    Personally I have always had a weak spot for what many would consider
    "difficult" clients since it challenges creativity.

    So here are my thoughts on how you could approach treating the girl:

    It is difficult for me without seeing the girl to get an understanding of
    her reactions, but autistic children are usually very sensitive about
    people who they don't know invading "their personal space" and to unknown
    environment. So if you want to treat, you might need a way around this. 
    You could for example create a Chikey card with the remedies for the first
    treatment and explain to the mother how to use it, so she can treat her
    daughter in the safe environment of her own home.

    Since you can't measure this girl, you will have treat Whiplash and Spin
    Inversion anyway and then go by your observation.

    Instructions for the mother:
    1. Whiplash Treatment
    2. Spin Inversion treatment (3x with saliva, since blood is probably not
    possible)
    3. On the card for the >12 Year Program I would load: 
    Poliomyelitis, Anti-Tetanus, Selenium, Atropinum, Billiary Cirrhosis,
    Cholecystitis, Calculi Billiaris and Mercury.
    4. On the card for the Foot Plate treatment:
    Solidago, Aesculus, Berberis, Injeel Chol, Fel Tauri, Cerebrum, Thalamus,
    Viscum
   
    The focus on the most damaging vaccinations and the Gallbladder hopefully
    initiates enough change in the girls system for her to be able to be
    measured next time. But always proceed slow and feel where the girls
    boundaries are. Maybe more treatments have to be done without measuring... 
   
    It might also be possible to work with the mother in your own treatment
    room and use your Chiren, by putting the remedies in, walking out of the
    room and let the mother push the start button and help her with holding the
    rods when she feels her daughter is ready. But as Renate wrote: It might
    cause your Chiren damage when things don't work out.

    It may be worthwhile, too, to have her family consider her exposure levels
    to EMR and magnetic fields. I posted a link to a presentation on the
    affects of electromagnetic radiation on children under the
    Electrosensitivity section of the 'Other therapies and instruments'
    category. Behavioral issues, including suicidal thoughts and autism, have
    been associated with electromagnetic radiation.
  • 
    TorilJelterTorilJelter
    February 2015 edited February 2015 Flag
    Yes lowering EMR in the treatment room may help i.e. turn off WiFi, all
    cell phones/ cordless phones off or in airplane mode, no energy efficient
    light bulbs near child/ no fluorescent lights, away from Smart Meter etc. I
    find some children with autism tolerate the session better if I offer it
    outdoors-weather permitting- some even react to electricity in the
    building. One 6 year old girl I treated was suicidal and did much better
    when her family moved into the yard in a tent for awhile!
    A certified Building Biologist might be helpful to the family to get
    accurate measurements of EMR exposure. A Smart Meter near the childs
    bedroom may be part of the problem.

    I have found treating children with autism with the footplates rather than
    hand rods is more acceptable to them and decreases risk to your equipment.
    Johan or Karolina can you confirm that doing any program on the footplates
    is OK if hand rods won't work?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    February 2015 edited February 2015 Flag
    There is definitely a difference between Hand rod or Footplate treatment,
    although the exposure to the light theoretically seems to be of no
    consequence and should reach every place in the body equally, I have found
    that there actually is a difference in practice. The fact that there are
    different meridians on the hands and the feet does make a difference. The
    Hormone System, which is extremely relevant to treating autism should be
    treated through the hands.

    Toril, you ask if it is OK to do a Footplate treatment if the Hand
    treatment does not work, but I have never experienced this with autistic
    children. If you are calm yourself the child will calm down to, at least
    that is my experience. Even with the most difficult ones I have not had
    much problems. If necessary you can hold the childs hands around the rods.
    Often the parent has a big influence on the child too. Then the
    practitioner should offer a calming influence that is bigger than the
    stress of the parents. You should never go along with the parents'
    projections. The child needs to feel that he or she is in good hands and
    everything is safe.

    Exchanging hand rods I have ONLY done in those rare cases where people
    don't have hands. So it is a last resort. In this case I find it
    unnecessary.

    IF there is sensitivity to EMF fields, then there is always a reason for
    this. Most of the time the reason lies in the body, it has weakened it. But
    I have also never found EMF stress to be a Cause of autism.

    There must be a reason. Generally I found that vaccinations are the reason.
    But then various processes have also gone wrong, and need to be addressed
    also. I find that putting all of the blame on EMF is a mistake. EMF
    sensitivity is a SYMPTOM and never a cause.
  • 
    TorilJelterTorilJelter
    February 2015 Flag
    I agree. I don't put all the blame on EMF. It's just one contributing
    factor. Metals (heavy) , chemicals and pathogens, digestive issues, immune
    imbalance are all also important. That is helpful to know the hand rods
    have a better effect than the footplates particularly when addressing the
    hand meridians. Sometimes I struggle with your use of the words cause and
    effect Johan as it seems many of the chronic ailments of today have
    multiple contributing factors. When you say cause do you mean the initial
    precipitating trigger?
  • 
    Irina
    February 2015 edited February 2015 Flag
    If hand rods have better effect on hand meridians, does this mean that foot
    plates can address better feet meridians? Like for example to put nosodes
    for Gall Bladder into foot program instead of hand program?
    Just curious...
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    February 2015 edited February 2015 Flag
    Toril: The initial cause is never the trigger of an illness. The initial
    cause in chronic/modern diseases is suppressed and has led to new problems,
    which then also become causes of other problems. This way you get a whole
    "syndrome" with many complaints. But these symptoms are usually suppressed
    again by pills or maybe even habits like excessive exercise. 

    Even when symptoms have disappeared, as long as there are underlying
    imbalances a whole series of new complaints can arise. It is like a
    snowball that goes on and on and on, you have to peel all the layers back
    to its origin. This origin is the initial cause, but you cannot go to this
    initial cause right away. You have to peel away one cause after another. If
    you only remove the most superficial layers, symptoms may disappear but  a
    new trigger can cause the same or other symptoms with the same underlying
    cause to (re)appear. When a trigger activates this underlying problem,
    although the complaints seem different, they are all caused by the same
    problem. 

    Summary: you always have to look at the current situation and the direct
    cause, and when this is resolved then the deeper causes will become clear.
    You need to continue working until all is balanced (in a series of
    sessions, not in one session!).

    Irina: This may be a right assumption, but it may also NOT be the remedies
    BUT the light itself that needs to go through both hands and feet to open
    up and balance all meridians. So it is not exactly clear as to what has the
    effect on the Hormone System in the hand treatment. The only thing I know
    is that you need to have both a hand session and a footplate session to get
    optimal results.

    The problem with what you suggest, is that it does not fit our need for
    information. You need to treat with ALL the remedies that you have selected
    to balance the layers of your focus during the first treatment, so that the
    second measurement shows whether they have worked or not (usually they
    should!). And the next step is that you can support the healing that you
    have initiated with the nosodes. 

     When you would delete the nosodes from the hand treatment and you put them
    in the footplate treatment there will not be enough space left for proper
    support and you cannot compensate by putting extra support remedies in the
    hand treatment because they will interfere with an accurate re-measurement
    (supports are broad spectrum and may mask drops that you need to correct
    with nosodes!)

    If "it may also NOT be the remedies BUT the light itself that needs to go
    through both hands and feet to open up and balance all meridians"....

    Would it be logical then use Footplates with no remedies after hand
    treatment is done (with remedies) for clients who are very sensitive or
    weak not to overwhelm their systems with additional information? This
    approach might make sense when people are very ill and need sessions more
    often then every 5 days (when time is en essence). What is your thought on
    this?

    Johan,

    So if I understand correctly your comment to Irina:

    1. No nosodes in footplate dyslexia treatment-ever
    2. No supports in hand treatments-ever

    These are both changes to what I have previously been told.

    Regarding your comment to me: Yes I do understand that helping to heal
    chronic illness with biophoton therapy is like peeling off layers of skin
    on an onion. Only when you get to the center of the onion can good health
    shine bright and sometimes there are some tears along the way... :((

    New Topic? :PROTOCOLL

    but prompted by above discussion:

    Earlier I was trained to sometimes do 2 hand treatments on children rather
    than hand and foot because some children can't sit still so long. Has this
    changed?

    Til now if possible I do hand and then foot treatments on children
    according to measurements and protocoll BUT I do have clients younger than
    5 years old with limited ability to cooperate. Would you rather we not
    treat than to have to do something other than protocoll for example 2 short
    hand treatments, one with nosodes, one with supports.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    February 2015 edited February 2015 Flag
    Yelyena: Yes, you can just use empty footplates as long as you then on the
    hand treatment use half nosodes and half support. Because is you treat with
    8 nosodes without support, this is not a good idea. I wonder what you mean
    with very ill. Usually it is not a good idea to treat more than once every
    5 days. Especially when someone is really ill. Only when someone is taken
    care of full time and is deadly ill you could consider to treat more often.
    It is more of a last resort.

    Toril: This is a misunderstanding. You can use nosodes on the footplates
    and you can use supports in the hand treatment. But the hand treatment is
    the treatment you mainly need to get the points/meridians of focus balanced
    and the footplates are then in general used to support those points/
    meridians/conditions you treated. Usually, after the hand treatment, there
    will be no drops on the layers you have worked on anymore, but if there
    are, you may need one or two nosodes on the footplates. This is not a
    problem.

    By being very ill, I meant treating clients who are close to death. I have
    never treated continuously client with this level of deterioration. But I
    think this type of condition will deserve special attention on the Forum.

     I had one person who was very ill and came to me right before going to
    radiation treatment. She planned to come after but, of course, it never
    happened. After radiation she died within month. 

    Thank you for REMINDER to us that we have put Nosodes and Supports in the
    hand treatment in such case. Then Footplates can be run free of any
    remedies.

Digestive Issues related to Depression

DennisOwensDennisOwens
January 2014 edited February 2014 in Symptoms Flag
Client:
Female 61. 

I began treating this client shortly after taking the Basic 1 course in
September. So my early work was perhaps not very good or reliable.
But I have continued to treat her as my own understanding of the protocol and
skill has improved.
I have been treating according to protocol, addressing hormonal issues first.
Then intestinal etc.

Symptoms:
Gut issues => Abdominal Pain, Nausea, Flatulence, Gurgling
Sleep issues => rarely sleeping through the night - up to pee
Anxiety/Depression => debilitating but not paralyzing able to function but
anything outside of routine seems overwhelming.
Hot Flashes => frequent
Tonsil Stones => occasionally

History:
Very active => many professional and social responsibilities and projects.

Medication:
Anti-depressants => on and off over the years, has not used them since October
Flu shot => Januray 11th

Supplements:
Stopped taking supplements in October,
Since 2 weeks back on some supplements again to relieve symptoms:
Mastic gum
Deglycyrrhiznated Licorice (DGL)
Digestive enzymes
Betaine Hydrocloride (HCL) with Pepsin
She doesn’t feel the supplements are helping her.

Symptoms since I began treating her:
Abdominal conditions => some improvement in November
Anxiety / depression worsened.
Very stressful December
Mild sinus cold during the Holidays
Intestinal Flu/bug (diarrhea, vomiting) which she says she caught from her
mother.
Diarrhea beginning January 3 – lasted 4 days
All conditions have worsened.
She's very frustrated
Depression is worse => considering returning to taking anti-depressants
she's planning to see an integrative MD in a few weeks

I would love to make some good progress quickly so that she doesn’t go further
backward.

    Thank you so much, Peter, for your observations and comments.

    I misstated because there have never been kidney issues showing and yes I
    have normally treated Circulation second, but based on a recent class with
    Johan, I had heard that I was to try to treat the causal organ. Since I had
    treated circulation/veins numerous times prior to these sessions, I thought
    I would try simply going for intestinal remedies. Was I mistaken about
    this?

    Probable causes for Depression:
    1. Adrenal Fatigue. This woman is clearly a person who burns the candle on
    both ends. Having a very active life while not sleeping well. This leads to
    fatigue and fatigue is often the cause of negative thinking which leads to
    depression. 
    2. Intestinal Issues (lack of healthy Flora), also cause fatigue and
    depression.
    3. Liver problems are also causal in fatigue and depression.
   
    Her peeing at night might be due to:
    1. Drinking too much before going to bed
    2. Bladder weakness caused by Appendicitis => Intestinal Bacteria moving
    out of the Intestines, infecting the Bladder. (When Intestinal Flora moves,
    it normally goes to the Urinary Tract first but could also go to
    Gallbladder, Liver)
    In case of Bladder Infection first get rid of the Appendicitis and then
    treat the Bladder with Bacteria or Bladder Remedies.
    3. Bladder weakness caused by Liver/Gallbladder => muscle weakness

    Treatment Advise:
    * The first things to get right are her Adrenals and her Intestines and
    Intestinal Flora.

    * The first session you describe, there's clearly an indication for
    Appendicitis Necroticans with all the points dropping on the Large and
    Small Intestines. Since Intestinal points continue to drop and there's not
    much improvement I suggest you try this Nosode first.
    First get rid of the Appendicitis and then try to rebuild the Intestinal
    Flora.
   
    * When 4 points drop on the Gallbladder they usually are not all corrected
    by just Calculi Billiaris. It is more likely that you need Billiary
    Cirrhosis or Cholecystitis and if they don't match Zirrhose Hepatis.
   
    Answers:
    1. The Flu Shot could defintely have caused a worsening of the symptoms,
    but it is not necessary that this was the case. 
    Because of her lifestyle and a continuing need to keep performing her
    problems in life would get worse anyway. Stress adds up, and the flu shot
    is another stressor, but not the only one.
   
    2. The effect of the Flu Shot can be measured. Usually balancing her system
    again according to what you have learned, and with the remedies in the
    Chiren, will also help the body correct the effects of this shot. 

    If you feel it would help you could however create your own Anti-Flu-Shot
    remedy on a card when you would have access to it. Some distributors of
    Homeopathic Medicine will have potentized remedies of the specific flue
    shots available too. Be ware to use only dilutes and no pellets or pills to
    be sure of its effectiveness.

    3. To do Symptom treatment for depression, while you work on the Underlying
    Cause, you could use some of the Remedies that are indicated for this
    specific symptom. (you can use your Remedy List and a Homeopathic Materia
    Medica or the internet to look it up).
    Plumbum, Tuberculinum and Ignatia are all options.

    But treating the cause is the way to go. And this cannot happen if the
    lifestyle is not changed.
   
    4. I don't know about the correlation between Tonsil Stones and
    Kieferostitis. So I have no comment, but would like your reasoning.
   
    5. When people are using anti-depressants I usually let them continue to
    take them until the overall condition improves, and then they can taper
    them off. LINK

    6. I always tell people to stop supplements. They are a burden to the
    system and are the cause of many digestive issues.

    Response to previous comments:

    1. I have talked to her about ways to let go of some stress and to do less
    to be able to allow her adrenals to recover. She seemed willing to give it
    a try.

    2. I will try the supports for depression. I am thinking that Tuberculinum
    may be a good since she also has frequent hot flashes, sleep issues, and
    some skin issues/skintags/moles.

    3. I thought that I had heard there was a correlation to Kieferostitis in a
    Q&A but perhaps I misunderstood.

    4. Do you consider liquids such as Fish Oil to be supplements as well?

    In addition to the Causes of depression I mentioned before I would like to
    add:
    Toxins => There are particular Poisonings that automatically cause
    Depression and Fatigue (e.g. Lead)

    Answers:

    3. Depression is generally caused by Fatigue, for which the Causes vary
    wide. 
    All Infections have in common that they cause you to feel miserable and
    tired. Infections take away your focus/concentration and Kieferostitis is
    no exception. Chronic Jaw infections can affect many other systems without
    you knowing it.

    4. I consider a Fish Oil also a supplement, and not an innocent one. There
    have been negative reports and these supplements are also often
    contaminated with Heavy Metals.
   
    Please do not focus on the Depression, a Symptom, but on the Body so that
    its Systems are regenerated.

Blood Transfusions

Janet
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Contraindications Flag
Is it possible to use the Chiren safely on an client who has  Cmml 1 leukemia
and receives  supportive therapy Gammaglobulin and transfusion every 2 months?
 

Will the transfusions interfere with her health safety?  I feel that a
transfusion is foreign substance and might make matters worse.  What is your
opinion and suggestion?  Has anyone treated a client who has had recent
transfusions?  What would be the protocol for treating this client? I will see
her on Friday Feb 15 for her first visit. I will need lots of help and guidance
treating this client.

    I will look it up in my books and answer you again. but first of all Johans
    teachings is that Leukemia derives from Spin inversion!  The Blood
    transfusions are no good for her body from a Biontology point of view. I
    will get back to you daytime Norwegian time with details.

    CMML is a myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative disorder. It is
    essentially 2 types of leukemia .So it is a "tricky" complex leukemia (do
    not let the "C" for chronic fool you it can be a rapidly progressive
    disease, with a very poor western medical prognosis) stemming from the bone
    marrow essentially going haywire with all the blood cells.

    In her case the hemoglobin (plus many other factors) must be way off.
     Symptoms for different people are different in the way it progresses.  I
    know because I had it... CMML.   I was not a practitioner then and Johan
    and Karolina did a magnificent job treating me on "what showed up"
    because..I am well! (very well, remarkable, as the Dr. says.)   

    I do believe mine, as Johan says, was caused by spin, in my case perhaps by
    the massive radiation from flying (Flight attendant)  I was always in spin.
     I am sure they can guide you well, as well as measuring for what shows up.
    I know too my GB and spleen were in bad shapee, then my liver showed up!

    I had no transfusions, so I too am very interested in what the answer to
    this is, particularly in relation to the transfusions, as I have several
    clients who have had or may need transfusion, and the measurements
    definately change after such.  Is there a period of time we need to wait
    after a transfusion to treat?

    I feel that it would not be safe to treat her with the Chiren. Blood
    transfusion is like a temporary organ transplant and if you stimulate the
    body's immune function, the negative response, that will always be there
    whether treated or not treated, will come sooner.

    Too many transfusions will kill anybody. My experience is that many people
    feel better after a transfusion but after a number of transfusions they get
    very sick.They will start vomiting extensively. Then they think that they
    get dehydrated and get another infusion not with blood but with 0,9% saline
    solution. That makes them even sicker.

    This is my personal experience with a number of AIDS patients, who used to
    take transfusions, just to feel better.

    I think it might be worth to try to drink chlorophyl in stead of
    transfusions. I've no experience with this myself, but it was suggested to
    me years ago, since Chlorophyl has the same structure as Hemoglobin with
    the only difference being the Magnesium instead of Iron in the core. 

    When there's no Leukemia and the blood quality is good people can also do a
    transfusion with their own blood. Take it from the person a while before
    they might need it. 

    I would wait at least 6 months after a transfusion. 
    (average life of red blood cells is 4 months, so just to be on the safe
    side half a year is necessary)

    I have canceled her appointments.  We will wait 6 months before we decide
    to whether or not to go with the Chiren.  I have advised her on chlorophyll
    and have given her the web site where she can purchase the most advanced
    natural nutraceutical micro-algae known at this time.  I hope this will
    begin her road to recovery.

    Thank you for all this valuable information.  I am sorry you cannot treat
    her Janet, it took her such a long time to come to you, and fear is such a
    part of her life.  In her case she is being treated by the Mayo clinic and
    their protocols so I hope the chlorophyl and micro-algae will postpone her
    transfusions. 

    I have treated one client with Leukemia after his many transfusions and
    fortunately had no ill effect, (Thank heavens)  in fact he responded well
    when being treated for 2 months -  however I noted his points were
    significantly different than before the transfusion.  I will not do so any
    more based on this conversation, and am grateful to now understand the
    risk.

     The client who has Cmml 1 leukemia has notified me today by email that she
    has a condition called genetic hemochromatosis (a disorder that causes the
    body to absorb too much iron). She has been taking Micro Algae and Wheat
    Grass as I had suggested because Johan said to drink chlorophyll instead of
    taking transfusions for the Cmml 1 leukemia. She is concerned that the Iron
    in the cholorphyll might make her iron go up. She is now at 400, and states
    that her doctor is not concerned until it gets to 1000. Would you advise
    her to continue on ingesting  the Chlorophyll from the micro algae and
    wheat grass?  If she stays off of transfusions she will be able
    to work with me on the Chiren in June.  That would be 6 months since the
    last transfusion.

    I have heard that fresh coconut water( not coconut milk or bottled coconut
    water) is very similar to blood plasma and know people who have used it
    therapeutically, but not in a case of transfusion.    Perhaps she could
    alternate it with the chlorophyll, but it would need to be researched.

    I just receive an email about my potential client who has Cmml 1 leukemia
    and genetic hemochromatosis (a disorder that causes the body to absorb too
    much iron).  She was considering another transfusion if her iron went up. 
    She has now reported and I quote, "I just got my blood work and my
    hemoglobin has gone up 12 points since taking the micro algae. It took a
    few weeks but that did it. Looks like I can make the 6 months and do the
    bio-photon in June. Thank you so much for telling me about this wonderful
    product." 

     It looks like I will be able to work with her on the Chiren in June, which
    is 6 months from her last transfusion.

    I would like the the name of the website where the advanced natural
    neutraceutical micro-algae can be purchased. Please post.

    I also have hemochromatosis. In my case, before Chiren in my life,
    structural doctors said the condition caused the excess iron to migrate to
    the spleen and kill off my red blood platelets. The dead platelets clog the
    portal to my Liver. My platelet count is extremely low (20) Luckily I had
    stopped alpha lipoic transfusions for 7 months before my class.

    In my last two treatments with Chiren my Spleen did not show drops.

    1st session
    Pancreas (right) - first point - Anacardium
    Large Intestine - point 4&5 - Intestinal Flora
    Stomach 1st point - Erigotheel, Nux vomica and Mucosa

    2nd session
    Pancreas (right foot) - 1st point -Momordica, Syzygium
    Large intestine - point 2 & 3 - Intestinal Flora, Diverticulose
    Liver - 4th point - Carcinoma Hepatis Metastasis, Atropinum Graphitis

    Footplates both treatments (Standard Program):
    Spascupeel, Nux Vomica, Hepar, Hepeel, Leptandra

    Question:
    Why do I not see drops in Circulation and Spleen?
    I know to treat by measuring dropping points, but I'd appreciate any
    suggestions for Hemochromatosis.

    This potential client who had been taking blood transfusions (but stopped)
     now informs me that she has been taking IV Gamma globulin infusions every
    month since Oct.  She says that this month will be her last one. 

    She wants to set up an appointment in June to work with her since that
    would be 6 months since she has had the last Blood transfusion.  I feel
    that Gamma globulin transfusions are just as foreign to the body as Blood
    Transfusions and that it would not be wise for me to treat her in June. 
    What is your opinion?  

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    The difference between a Blood Transfusions and a Gamma Globulin Infusions
    is that in the latter one there are no Cells that are alive... 

    So unlike the Blood Transfusion the Gamma Globulin Infusion is not a "
    temporary organ transplant". Although they are very harmful to the body,
    just like vaccinations are, this is not a contra-indication for treatment.

    Gamma Globulin Infusions introduce Foreign Serum into the body, so to treat
    that imbalance you might find in your Session with her that she needs Serum
    Ovile (sheep serum) or Anti-Tetanus (horse serum).

    It is 6 months since my client's last blood transfusion, and she likes to
    start with Biophoton treatment.

    She is still getting IVIG Gamma globulin treatments, she still is unsure
    about this because according to her it has traces of blood in it.

    Question:
    Does it matter if there are traces of blood in the Gamma Globulin, and will
    it be safe to treat her with the Chiren while she is still getting it?

    I only had 3 visits with this client. She has a question the she wants

    of those treatments and her questions are as follows:

    "We have been thinking about more treatments and buying the Chikey but I am
    a little afraid as my white cells started to grow when I took the
    treatment. We were wondering if we could ask Johan if the biophoton
    treatment could actually cause the white cells to grow or if it is the
    disease process. We are not sure what to do untill we hear from Johan.
    Should we continue with biophoton treatments from the Chiren? Also should
    we get the Chikey and if so what remedies should we put into it? I am going
    to have another bone marrow biopsy next month to see if they have started
    to grow faster. What I need to do is to lower the white cells."

    An increase in leucocytes is a response of the body to any infection, it is
    not directly a reaction on the Chiren treatments.
   
    An increase in white blood cells might be caused by:
    a) a chronic condition becoming more acute => the Chiren/Chikey has removed
    a suppression of a certain infection/condition
    b) an increased immune response => the body has suddenly realised that more
    leucocytes are necessary to correct the situation
    c) a chronic infection (like chronic tonsillitis, appendicitis).
    d) the bone marrow being affected, causing an overproduction of white blood
    cells

    Leucocytes are produced in the bone marrow. Bone marrow in Biontology is
    under control of the Gallbladder/Liver systems. If there are no infections
    to be addressed, the reason might be the Gallbladder/Liver, which are
    damaged in most people. Continued treatment of these organ systems is
    necessary to get healthy blood.

    A client with Stage IV likely renal cancer wants biophoton therapy. He had
    a blood transfusion 2 days ago. Can I just do spininversion and support on
    the footplates and AVOID nosodes OR could even that cause donor blood
    rejection? He might not live for 6 months...so it is hard to wait as he is
    a family member.

Questions about the Protocol

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
February 2013 edited February 2013 in Questions for the H.A.A. Flag
If anybody has any questions or suggestions for the measurement protocol, they
can be posted here. I didn't want to release anything of the manual before it
was edited and completed, but there was so much need for a general guideline
that even in this stage this guideline can be very helpful I believe.... But
please share with me what is not understood or confusing.

I already have to clarify some points:

Johan often says that he indicates Whiplash only on the Thyroid point, but that
is because the Para-Thyroid always drops in the first treatment. In case of a
Whiplash both points should always drop together. You can't have a Whiplash
with only the Thyroid dropping. (Unless there was a measurement problem).

The protocol needs another procedure (point 1) before everything else, where
both hands and feet are measured to make a general assessment. Otherwise the
information on what the Spin-Inversion treatment and Whiplash treatment have
corrected is lost. And this information is critical for your further
assessment.

The correction of the Whiplash first is also confusing and is going to be
changed in the protocol. In this order the information of what organ systems
were influenced by the Whiplash treatment is lost. 
Johan instructed me to create this order in the protocol because he thought
that maybe correcting the Whiplash first and thus restoring the energetic body
(connect head and body) would make the Spin Inversion treatment more effective
(especially for the energetics of the head). This doesn't seem to be the case
and the information of what were the imbalances before each treatment procedure
is very important, so it is better to do it as it was always done... first Spin
Inversion if you measure it and then measuring everything again and if Thyroid
and Parathyroid still drop do the Whiplash Treatment.

    Every time I feel like I am doing this correctly I take another step back.
     Are the hand charts we recieved a few weeks ago correct, or the latest

    What MM did was the way we learned it in class (WC-1).  Are the corrections

    Hi,

    As there are no stupid questions... and sometimes I feel as I do not always
    understand things right because of the language, I ask for some
    clarifications.

    1) I read somewhere on this forum about: 'the 10-minute standard treatment
    in the 1st session'. I am not sure what is meant by this.

    2) Also about controle 'whether the client has ''taken'' the treatment' :
    is that when in the last check around, there are no drops?

    3) Then also Johan wrote somewhere here about physically accepted/
    energetically not accepted (or otherwise) treatment. Could you explain this
    please?

    4) Protocol 19/ Using nosodes with Dyslexia-program. Is it right you leave
    the nosodes in and only could change a remedy halfway? (not change the
    nosode in a remedy?)

    Thanks for help!

    1) Here the >12 Program is meant (9.52 minutes is almost 10)

    2) This is the expression that some practitioners use when remedies have
    corrected the energetic situation (no more drops)

    3) I don't know which discussion you've read this. But I think this is what
    is meant:
    * "energetically accepted" refers to a remedy being able to correct the
    energetic condition (which you can measure on the acupuncture points) 
    * "physically accepted" means that the remedy did not only correct the
    energetic condition but also improved the physical condition. Sometimes a
    remedy seems to match, but is not effective in improving the physical
    condition for different reasons (therapy resistance, quality of the remedy,
    deeper cause that holds the condition in place....etc.)

    4) ??? It is possible to change remedies half way on the footplates if more
    support is needed. It is best to change the remedies that you did not
    measure for (support).

    1. In a recent post response, Johan has stated that he never found
    Mellilotus and Hamamelis to correct the Artery/Circulation.  He inferred
    Barijoheel to be the single item of choice.  Comments?  Maybe this should
    be in the protocol?  

    2.  He also observed my choice of Left Insulin point to be Gallbladder
    remedies as being not indicated for this point.  He added that this point
    should be corrected when the other hormone points are balanced.  Maybe this
    should be added to the protocol. 

    3.  Also NOTE , the present protocol has the solutions to balancing the
    Pancreatic gland (underproduction) to be GALLBLADDER REMEDIES.....  should
    this be removed from the protocol????

    4.  What then, if the balancing of the hormones does not correct the
    Insulin point on the left hand, are the remedies for the Insulin point of
    the Left hand? Vaccines?  HEEL list Hepeel, Injeel Chol, and Vertigoheel,
    (the latter not in the Chiren), for Hypoglycemia.  

    5.  Since Appendix Nectroticans can resolve many, including Hormones, when
    all the LargeIntestine and Small Intestine points drop, why not give this
    highlight in the protocol?  I say this because of the sequence of the itmes
    in the protocol list this a few point after the Hormones.....

    1. This was a comment in context with your specific case, it was the most
    likely match... 
    There are other remedies that can correct Circulation, but I don't find
    Mellilotus and Hamamelis on Circulation (Arteries) ever.

    2&3 The Left Insulin point is the Insulin OVER production (=Hypoglycaemia),
    and not the Diabetic point that often needs Gallbladder remedies.

    4 Use Selenium and Berberis, this almost always corrects the Hypoglycaemia
    point, if it hasn't already happened after balancing the Pituitary and
    Parathyroid glands.
    If the usual does not work, however, try the unusual… Of course the
    protocol only lists the most common solutions, and not the very rare
    exceptions.

    5 Appendicitis is not the first thing you try on the Hormone System. Just
    like Tonsillitis it CAN affect all meridians and organs, also the Hormone
    System, but this is again not the most common situation so also not
    relevant to put in the protocol. These are the things that you can read
    about here on the Forum or in the classes...

    Hi Stefano,

    Thank you for notifying me about the Gallbladder remedies being listed
    under both Insulin points. I saw I almost duplicated this mistake in the
    new protocol I am working on.

    August 2014 edited August 2014 Flag
    Concerning your comments on 2&3, I am aware that the left is the
    hypoglycemic point, I was trying to find remedies that would be in addition
    to the Selenium/Berberis selection or the mistaken Gallbladder remedies. 
    Where can one find this information?  Sorry for the confusion....

    Questions:
    1. What I also like to know: If Selenium and Berberis fail and you have
    treated these in previous sessions and the Insulin point comes up again,
    what are the suggestions...?

    2. Also, are you saying that the Hamemalis and the Mellilotus are remedies
    for Veins not Arteries?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    August 2014 Flag
    Answers:
    1. If Pituitary and Parathyroid are corrected and Berberis/Selenium fail to
    correct the Insulin point on the left hand, this is a situation that I
    personally did not encounter. My advise is to continue and try to remedy
    the other meridians you are focussing on, and then come back to this point
    to check if it was corrected. 
    If the usual remedies don't work you then start to try uncommon
     solutions…. this can be anything.

    2. Yes, this is where these remedies match in measurement.

    1. I have also recently run into a problem with the left hypoglycemic
    hormone point and tried unsuccessfully measuring the recommended items that
    worked on client previously. Can the new manual suggest possible directions
    to take here in searching for remedies?

    2. Can the footplates section be clarified? Specifically, the protocol
    states hormonal, kidney, and circulation must always be corrected during a
    session. What if it takes 10-14 nosodes to do that? In other words, after
    hand treatment, what if you still need to clear one or more of those three
    crucial meridians? Are we supposed to clear those 3 in hand treatment
    alone?

    3. Should we remeasure from the beginning trying different nosodes if we
    fail to clear these systems during hand treatment?

    4. How many nosodes can be safely used in footplates?

    5. Many people seem confused by the suggestions to add viscum, cerebrum,
    and thalamus to footplate treatment. I know you are now aware of this and
    that this tip was meant for actual dyslexia treatment. Just mentioning
    again.

    6. Can spin cup with sample be left in chiren during entire session or must
    it be disconnected after spin treatment itself?

    Thanks!
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    August 2014 Flag
    Answers:
    1. If the normal nosodes do not work, you have to try the abnormal ones
    which can be anything. This, however, is so uncommon that it has no place
    in the protocol.
    You could start trying the toxins like Formaldehyde, Dioxin or Intestnal
    Bacteria. You may also try Appendicitis or Kieferostitis. If they do not
    match, take a rest and continue with other points first. The remedies for
    the other points might also balance the insulin point.

    2. There is absolutely no need to balance all the points in one treatment.
    Start with the organs in proper sequence. If the box is full, leave the
    rest but only focus on 1 or 2 meridians. 

    3. Again, there is no need to balance all the meridians. Focus and limit
    the number of nosodes.

    4. If you already used 8 nosodes in the hand treatment, you should use no
    nosodes on the footplates. If there were also support remedies, you can use
    a similar number (as the support remedies in the hand treatment) of nosodes
    on the footplates. 

    6. The Spin Inversion cup with blood sample can be left in during the
    entire treatment, but should be disconnected during measurement.
  • 
    Cyoung
    August 2014 Flag
    Thanks for clarifying, a few more questions...

    1. So, no need to clear hormonal, kidneys, and circulation in one hand and
    foot session? I assume hormonal is critical though?

    2. If someone already received a treatment using more than the recommended
    number of nosodes, is there any way to assist them in dealing with this
    over-treatment?

    3. Is footplate treatment in service of the hand treatment to provide
    support to whatever was cleared in addition to whatever organs were not
    cleared?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    August 2014 Flag
    1. At least have Hormones and Kidneys clear at the end of the session, but
    you should not need that many nosodes for that….

    2. Rest and drinking water is the best thing you can do. Every treatment,
    even without remedies, will give additional information to the body and
    overdose even more.

    3. The organs that were treated with the nosodes, should be supported with
    the remedies in the footplate treatment. Support remedies also should be
    focused.
  • 
    Cyoung
    August 2014 Flag
    Many thanks. Sorry for the confusion. I must have misinterpreted the
    version of the protocol I refer to, believing the hormonal, kidney, and
    circulation meridians had to be cleared without exception each time.
    Hopefully, with a deeper understanding I will choose very few nosodes to
    get closer to the underlying source with each session. Right now, I seem to
    be mechanically running through the list of suggested remedies point by
    point.

Tonsil Stones

DennisOwensDennisOwens
February 2014 edited February 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client
Male 32

History:
I have been success treating this Client for several months
Good progress with main Symptoms
No drops showing past 2 sessions
Minor symptoms remain which want to be resolved

Main Symptoms - treated and resolved:
• Severe Heartburn
• Pressure in chest
• Acid Reflux
• Coldsores
• Mental fogginess

Unresolved Symptoms:
• Tonsil Stones /Bad Breath
• High Blood Pressure Examples: (143 over 85) (136 over 100)

Treatments:
-Tonsillarproefe (7x)
-Tonsillitis and Chronic Tonsillitis numerous times in the course of treatments
as well as Gallbladder

Questions
1. Since I am not able to find drops, should I simply treat according to
symptoms?
2. Are Tonsil Stones caused primarily by Tonsillitis?
3. Besides Tonsillarproefpe, which other nosodes or supports should I run to
eliminate the Tonsil Stones?
4. Since I am no longer able to measure drops should I still be running
Tonsillitis and Chronic Tonsillitis?
5. Would some lymph supports such as Lymphomyosot or AnginHeel be an effective
support?
6. Are dissolving/eliminating stones typically a long term effort ?
7. Would the high blood pressure be helped by running Mellilotus?
8. Would a Chikey with a Tonsillarproefe Card be a recommendation I should make
at this point. If so what program, remedies, and interval would you suggest?

    Thank you Dennis, your post is very easy to read this way.

    Answers:
    1. Yes, that's the only thing you can do when there are still symptoms and
    no drops anymore. 
    When the absence of drops is not because of endorphins, this means that the
    function of the organs is restored. However structural problems can still
    be there….

    2. Tonsil stones are "bacterial stones" that collect in the crypts of the
    Tonsils. I've had a lifetime of Chronic Tonsillitis with many Tonsil
    Stones… 
    My experience is, that when there's no Tonsillitis anymore, the stones will
    not be created anymore either. 
    But there's a theory that scarring of the Tonsils because of Chronic
    Tonsillitis creates more crypts where bacteria can collect/grow easily to
    create stones. 
    So susceptibility might be an ongoing structural problem, even when you've
    corrected all functions.

    3. I would use Tonsillarproepfe, Tonsillitis, Chronic Tonsillitis, Calculi
    Renalis (Tonsillar stones have calcium in them too), Phosphor,
    Lymphomyosot, Strep and Staph, Diphterinum (necrotic tonsil membrane),
    Procrainum (internal scarring), Tonsilla Compositum, Anginheel…  all
    experimental. I have not treated especially for Tonsil Stones, since mine
    just disappeared. 
    I think is is also a good idea to let him gargle with warm salt water every
    morning and evening to help clean the crypts out. 
   
    4. As long as the Tonsil Stones are there, there is a source of infection.
    If he's coming in for treatment anyway you can treat him with (Chronic)
    Tonsilitis
   
    5. Yes, I believe so. 
   
    6. The stones are structural and "outside" of the body. The fastest way to
    get rid of them is to gargle them out or to push them out as some people
    do. And then with the biophoton treatment you can prevent new formation.
   
    7. If there's nothing you can measure anymore, again it must be a
    structural problem. A possibility could be Calcification in the Circulatory
    System. So I think Barijodeel, Aurumheel, Calculi Bil /Cholesterinum,
    Crataegus and some other Circulatory supports would be the way to go.
    But High Blood Pressure can also be caused by Gallbladder problems of
    course… and then the lack of measurable points would be because of
    suppression...
   
    8. You can create Chikey cards with the remedies suggested above. One card
    for Circulation and one or two cards for the Tonsils and Lymphatic system.

Happy new year Johan & Karolina.  
May you be blessed for all you are doing for humanity

Question:
1. What Remedies to take before the Dental work, and after the Dental work for

    Answers:
    1.  The Cause of the pain determines what Remedies you could use. 
    * The usual Dental Remedies (Kieferostitis and Granuloma Denti) can be used
    for pain relief, assuming that these remedies match on the Jaw points (most
    proximal points on the Stomach Meridian). 
    * Belladonna is also a good Remedy for Infections in general.
    * You can also find out what are the causes of the Jaw infection(s). You
    might find Food Poisoning, Streptococcen or Staphylococcen, or Intestinal
    Flora to be a match.
    * In case of an Infection caused by a Root Canal, the Root Canal and the
    Tooth need to be removed. Infections often lead to Abscesses that are
    difficult to diagnose for a dentist, but can be the cause of considerable
    pain.
    Abscesses can measured with the Remedy Myristica Sebifera, which is not
    standard in your Chiren however. But this Remedy does not always lead to a
    solution, since it is very difficult for the abscess in the Jaw to drain.

    2. When Teeth are removed for cosmetic reasons (in the US this is common),
    I regard the procedure as harmful. 
    But if Wisdom Teeth clearly cause problems and when there is no alternative
    remedy for the pain or other problem that they might cause, then there is
    no choice but to pull.

    3. Always look for the Cause behind anything. Then the answer is clear.

    offering something besides titanium implants here in America.

    1b. She is flying to Amsterdam on 12 of May. Is your recommendation a

    1c. Do you know a dentist in the Netherlands that you might recommend for
    her???

    2. Also, if she decides to pull the tooth and do this other implant, does
    she need a bone graph?

    This happens when the Chiren has not been used for a while. The energy

    Then go to System and go to date-time format. Change the date and time to

    If you do not use the Chiren for a while the energy buffer runs empty.
    If you log on with your Administrator card, you should be able to change

Colic Treatment for Babies

5 week old baby with Colic.  
Has not received any vaccines.

Question:
Should I use the patches and orange and blue cables, or would glass rods

Lower rod/patch can be placed inside diaper, over lower spine, correct? Is the
Whiplash Program run for the full time?

    Are you talking only about the Whiplash? Then the Fibre-Optic Cable
    suffice. It should be run the normal time.

    But the treatment of the colics should go by normal treatment, i.e. place
    the rods in the hands of the baby and let the mother put her hands around
    the baby's hands. Or if this seems to complicated put the rods on both legs
    in the diaper.

    Colics are common for babies, normally when  the food is changed.

    few support remedies in for the Gallbladder and perhaps with Intestinal

Client:
65-year-old male (me)

History:
Childhood abuse
5 years old => standard vaccine protocol started => after, I became very
introverted and distant, until puberty
22-26 years old => multiple neck and head traumas
1st accident => Collar bone fracture, concussion.
2nd accident => concussion, loss of memory for a day, very poor balance for 9
months

Medication:
none, no history of them except dental work

Biontology Treatments:
Multiple Whiplash for the scars in the neck => very helpful.

6th Session (presently)

Symptoms:
Tooth/jaw pain on Large Intestine/Appendix tooth

>12 year program:
Pituitary - Vaccininum
Pineal - Serum Ovale
Stomach - Granuloma Denti
Sex Hormone - Poliomyelitis
ParaThyroid - Anti-Tetanus
Large Intestine - Chronic Tonsilitis (N.B. Appendix Necratans treated
previously)
Large Intestine - Tonsilitis
Adrenals - Berberis.

Footplates:
Atropinum, Berberis, Selenium, Solidago, Paradontose, Anacardium, Lymphomosot,
Anginheel


Reactions post treatment:
Jaw pain => increased for three days, following reverse order of dental work.
Increased right sided temple tension (has been a chronic issue) => resolved
much after the three days

Question:
1. In retrospect, my foot treatment was not supportive enough. I think I should
have excluded the Paradontose, and added more Kidney support.???


7th session

>12 year program:
Pituitary - Viscum
Parathyroid - Tonsitlitis
Thymus - Little Flannel Flower
Thyroid - Thyroidea
Insulin - Selenium
Large Intestine - Bacterium Pyo
Large Intestine, Lymph - Carcinoma Coli
Large Intesting Acending - Klebsellia Pneumoniae

Foot Plates:
Large Intesting (Left) - Bacterium Lactis - Podophylum
Circulation - Atropinum, Cerebrum, Aesculus
Kidney - Populus, Soladago, Reneel
Gall Bladder - Injeel Chol

Reactions post treatment:
Next day I could not raise my left arm,
Large Intestine point 15, was swollen, sore and painful
Colon was sore and bowels were soft, unformed.
Took five days to resolve => each day I would lift it a little more and more.

Comments:
It seems the lack of Kidney clearance was the problem since I had not cleared
Kidney Ureter and Peritoneum???
I also have to say that measuring oneself is a little tricky, my left hand
dexterity needs something to offer. If in fact the reading on the Pituitary and
Parathyroid are correct.

8th session

>12 years program:
Thymus - Selenium
Insulin Hypo - Ingeel Chol
Pineal and Thryoid - Pertussis and Variolinum
Appendix Point - Appendix Necroticans (back again)
Ascending Colon - Chronic Tonsilitis
Circulation - Hamamelis
Circulation - Mellitlotus

Foot Plates:
Circulation - Atropinum, Placenta
Lung (some drops, also some pain in Lung 1, right) - Bronchialis
Large Intestine - Anginheel - Discus (for connective tissue)
Numbness (can't raise arm) - Plumbum 
Lymph/Large Intestine - Mercurius Heel
Kidney support - Reneel
Bladder (some drops in Bladder) - Plantago 

Comments:
Some of these readings are poor due to self treatment. Unfortunately, I have no
local Biontologist to work with so I do the best....
Thyroid keeps coming up, not sure if it's a measurement error, but my choice
should change to nosodes, Which it does in treatment 9 and 10 but I still
failed to use another nosode, but these treamtents are more focused on the
colon and the kidney and the healings were more gentle...
My emotional state has been rather up and down => a lot of grief alternating
with irritabilty, the obvious Metal, Wood interaction. 
As you can see the past trauma, stored in the colon is resolving. 
I have a low level tension headache, not yet resolved but the neck and shoulder
is really improved greatly. 
My left abdomen, pancreas and colon are 'noticeable' in that it feels tight and
a little sore. 
I think the Appendix Nectroticans should have come up with the 'proper'
measuring in Treatment 6 but it showed up again in 8.



Sharing:
The Chiren is an amazing tool. We are presented with the Light from the inside
resulting in a better 'refection' of oneself. I like the hypothosis of Johan
that the cell is 'reflecting' the light of the soul. My belief system is
buddhist based so I see the reflection a little different. It is said in
Dzogchen Buddhist teachings that the emptiness is 'filled' with light and that
we are mirrors that reflect this light, this resonates with Biontology well....

    Hi Stefano

    Good to see you diving in with self treatment. I am not as bold but have
    given myself 2 treatments, both of which took 4-5 hours and slowly feeling
    the healing effects. Wondering if you have experienced the same issue I
    have had -- specifically, getting clear, static-free sounds from your
    points. Some of my points seem to measure clear on one try, and then as a
    drop on another pass.

    I understand it will take quite some time to measure myself accurately and
    know how to approach remedy selection. Helping me to record the
    measurements in the chiren and take a quick look back at all before
    deciding what to try in both the hand treatment and on foot plates. Also
    try to focus on treating the overall terrain, and not simply resort to
    symptom treatment.

    Loving the Chiren, too. Good luck, classmate! Hope you enjoy good health
    via biontology.

    Yes, the Chiren is AMAZING, but self treatment is really tricky for some of
    us. I do experience the same confusion on the readings.  What I think is
    happening is a change in pressure along with too much 'thinking' as Johan
    warns.  I also am really skeptical about measurments with my left hand,
    being a one language american....;)  In one response to my question about
    the three possible 'sounds', Johan cleared it up by dismissing the very
    slow drops, which is where I get confused in my self readings.  So if the
    drop is s l o w, I ignore it. 
    What helped me, also,  is having someone else listen: for some reason, this
    gave me some objectivity, don't know if it will work for you.  What I also
    do is refrain from the perfect protocol in self treatments ONLY, SO,  I
    first worked only on the hormones and the kidney, then as the kidney
    improved I focused on the Appendix Nectrotans, since I was sure I had that
    problem, from Johan's reading.  Then all hell broke loose with amazing
    'healing crisis', you can see my posts of Me, for details.  The value of
    that post is to see the homeopathic healing move thru its stages (from most
    recent, backwards) as well as the energy moving thru the meridians.  It is
    extremely educational in energetic terms. 

    As far as symptoms are concerned, I hardly pay much attention to them when
    doing the measuring, since the body is really telling me what it needs to
    do, in the measuring.  The foot plate is where I may use the symptoms as
    guide: say you have not measured for sex hormone but the client has told
    you he has dysfunction, then a support for this may be a good idea, like
    Testis, of course, I'd run this by Karolina or Johan for clarification. I
    hope you don't get three different answers, which in reality may be true,
    but confusing.  Each one may have a perfectly 'correct'  but different way
    of  dealing with the same situation.  That's the mystery of 'healing art'. 
    I think my post of 'Me' explains this well:  Johan's treatment of me was
    profound, deep yet gentle. I experienced emotional shifts as well as
    physical shifts, but mild, non intrusive.  On the other hand my self
    treatments resulted in severe healing crisis, tooth/jaw pain for a week,
    followed by 'paralyzed' left arm for a few days. If I didn't know what was
    happening I'd be in the dental chair, etc.  But it totally passed in the
    4-5 days as the protocol explains.  Fortunately, the sessions I do on my
    patients are much improved and their healings are somewhere between the
    'crisis' and the gentle.  I have not lost any of my Chiren clients yet.
    Conversely, the Chiren has increased my clientele rapidly.  It's the
    Light.  I too wish you good luck and healing.  It's a pleasure hearing from
    you.

    Hello Stefano,

    Going through these last couple of sessions, I wonder about there still
    being so many drops on the Hormone System. It is unusual to have to treat
    Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus again in the 6th session, so there must be
    something else causing all those drops.

    When there are serious tooth/jaw problems they can seriously affect the
    Hormone System. But Appendicitis Necroticans can also cause the Hormone
    Points to drop, and to get rid of it you need to continue focussing on it
    for several treatments until it is completely gone. 
   
    The Appendix often improves from the Necroticans stage to the Chronic
    stage, but can regress if you don't continue the treatment to acute and
    then nothing….  or sometimes a food poisoning can make it worse again.
   
    The neck/shoulder difficulties indicate intestinal issues that could be a
    result of the continuing Appendicitis.
    I see also Circulation issues but I am missing Barijodeel. I personally
    have never seen Mellillotus and Hamamelis matching on the Circulation/
    Arteries meridian.
  • 
    SVitale
    August 2014 Flag
    I wondered about the drops in the Hormones as well.  I am working with
    other nosodes now. 
    Concerning the Circulation/Arteries, are you suggesting that Barijoheel is
    the primary remedy or the only remedy that balances this meridian?

    Concerning the Appendix Necroticans, I think I have balance for that as
    well as the Chronic appendix.  I am now find, pain in the lower left
    quadrant and balances with Ca. Coli....and helps the pain, which goes thru
    the Spleen and Gall Bladder meridian.  I'm looking at the liver/gallbladder
    next....????
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    August 2014 Flag
    In this phase of treatment, on the Hormone System I would search for Toxins
    (e.g. Formaldehyde or Dioxin).
    For the Pineal gland you could also try Platinum or other Toxins that are
    breathed in through the air.

    Airborne Toxins can also affect the Thyroid and Parathyroid. But did you
    try on these last two points remedies like Rubella, Measles, Mumps?

    Hamamelis and Mellilotus are remedies that strengthen the valves in the
    veins. 
    Bariodeel or Aesculus are remedies that usually match on the Circulation
    meridian. This indicates calcium deposits.
    In some occasions Atropinum may be needed, indicating that the arteries are
    in a cramped condition.

    Numbness is caused by Circulatory/Venal issues. 

    But the problem with the raising of the arm is probably caused by
    Intestinal Issues. I would look for Intestinal Flora everywhere, 

    On the Lung meridian I would look for Streptococcus, Staphylococcus,
    Tuberculosis or Intestinal Bacteria.

    Can you explain your thinking? What do you want to use Causticum for? Were
    you exposed to radiation?
  • 
    SVitale
    August 2014 Flag
    Yes, Johan, there was much radiation from the heat, fires, computers
    melting, etc.  The first few weeks, the air would make you cry.  The air
    was toxic.  At the time I purchased an ozone/ionizer, I used the ozone in
    the office when I went left and ionized when I was there.  This helped to a
    certain extent.  So I was thinking causticum, don't know if its too late.

  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    August 2014 Flag
    It sounds to me like a lot of toxins, but not necessarily radioactivity…
    But you can always try and measure if it has an effect somewhere in your
    body.

    A fire like that exposes you to a lot of Toxins. I would try Dioxin,
    Formaldehyde, Asbestos...

November 2015 edited November 2015 in Case Discussions - Student Flag
Friday 13th November 2015, for the first time after my basic course in
September, I tried out treating a friend. I am conscious that I need to
practise on people that are not too sick at the beginning.

Client:
54 year old lady, works in the public sector.

History:
Suffered ritual physical and sexual abuse => since four years old => rituals
involved: forced drug use and mutilations (mainly on her back)
Shingles
Took drugs and alcohol
Binge eating..
Attempted suicide
Two divorces
Bullied at work => past and present 
Currently under disciplinary (union helps her fight her case) => has been going
on for some time now 

Symptoms:
physically tough 
Hyperthyroidism 
Allergy => dairy products
Emotionally she is not in a good place 
Constant anxiety and depression
Nightmares
Oscillating between deep anger and depression
Tired all the time => unable to function normally
Wants to give up and die

Medical Interventions:
Two abortions
Tubes tied
Radiation => for overactive Thyroid
Operation scheduled => February 2016

1st Session attempt (November 13th) 

1st Measurement of all points:
Small Intestine (L+R) - 3 points / 1 point
Heart (L+R) - 3 points / 1 point
Pituitary
Parathyroid
Insulin Hypoglycemic
Adrenal Medulla
Pineal
Thyroid
Circulation (L) - 2 points
Nervous System (L) - 2 points
Large Intestine (L+R) - 1 point / 2 points
Lungs (L) -1 point

Bladder (L+R) - 4 points / 4 points
Gallbladder (L+R) - 6 points / 3 points

2nd Measurement (only hands):
Heart - 1 point
Circulation - 1 point
Lungs - 1 point

Comments:
I was very tired by this time so we adjourned for tea. 
Altogether the whole process took just over 3 hours.

I am not sure if I had measured the points correctly. I did my best going
slowly and listening out for the sound for the correct point as taught in
class. Hopefully after more practice, I will become better at it.

Question
I need advice please as to how to help her with Biontology.

    Comments:
    I was not able to test her after the footplates as she was rushing off to
    meet a friend. 
    The session took two hours.

    Follow up, after 3 days. I rang her.

    Reactions after treatment:
    Day after the session => very emotional => shed floods of tears  
    Developed a sore throat and cough

    Questions
    2. As she had to go to the doctor to get another sick note, because she did
    not want to go to work under the unhappy circumstances. It was good in a
    way that she was unwell so she could be signed off from work. But it made
    me wonder whether I gave the wrong remedies? 
   
    3. Any advice would be gratefully received.

    Answers
    1. Your measurement skills and understanding/use of the protocol are key to
    successful treatment. I think you should first just practice measuring and
    then start using the protocol by following instructions step-by-step. In
    your case I see that you did not do this... I also think your measurements
    are not reliable yet.

    * You always need to treat with Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus in the
    session.
    * I can only further advise you to, in this case, also use Selenium and
    Berberis for the Adrenals and possibly the Hypoglycemia point and the
    Intestinal Flora (Bacterium Coli, Lactis, Pyo, and Proteus) for the
    Kidneys.
    * On the footplates I would use Kidney and Bladder support remedies.

    2. You have not treated her "normally" (according to protocol) in the first
    session. I only see the Whiplash and Spin Inversion treatments plus the
    Scars. I do not see the >12 yrs Hand treatment or Footplate treatment, and
    it is also not clear whether you actually found Whiplash and Spin Inversion
    in your measurement.

    And in the second session you have only given some support remedies. The
    treatment itself, even without any remedies, often releases a lot of
    suppression and can give an emotional release.

    3. Study the protocol thoroughly and work on your measurement skills, and
    make sure you are clear to your friend that you are practicing on her. If
    you follow the guidelines by treating the Hormone System and Kidneys first,
    followed by the Yang Organs and Yin Organs last, and you don't over-treat
    with nosodes, then you don't have to worry about creating problems.

Self Measurement & Treatment

Jiri
February 2013 edited February 2014 in Measurement Flag
Self Measurement

I'm exploring the best way of measuring meridians on myself. I've found that if
I place the finger that I'm measuring on the table while the rest are curled
around the brass rod, I can more easily measure my meridians. Does anyone have
a better method?
I'm also having difficulty finding some meridians. It seems to be where the
skin is thickened. Do you have suggestions?

Self Treatment

I seem to have an area of lack of knowledge in selecting remedies for
treatment. This is an example from my self measurement.

1.  I measured the 1st 2 points on my Triple Warmer on my left and right hands.
Both the thyroid & parathyroid were falling. 

2.  I selected whiplash treatment and placed my left hand with the light rod on
the back of my neck at the bottom of my skull. The second glass rod was placed
just below the protruding vertebrae and I pressed start. As the treatment
proceeded, I experienced chest tightness and an irregular heartbeat. I stopped
the treatment about halfway through. Did I do the treatment correctly? When
Johan gave a whiplash treatment, I had no problems. Or is it just coincidence.
(I have had a 15+ year bout with leaky gut syndrome, multiple food allergies,
edema and arthritis.) I can experience chest tightness and occasional irregular
heartbeats, especially when I have extreme edema. I would like a copy of the
whiplash protocol so I'm certain of conducting it correctly.

3. I remeasure the points and my thyroid and parathyroid were corrected.

4. I then completed all measurements on my hands & feet. I had the following
drops:

Left hand:  normal
Right hand: Large intestine: Li1b-1 (lymph vessels; peritoneum)
Organ Degeneration: OD1-a (faulty veg control)
Left Foot:  Kidney: Ki1a (ureter)
Right Foot:  Gallbladder  GB44 (Ductus chole.)

5.  Finding remedies:  I started with the Large Intestine using the Photon
Highway and put in Appendicitis Necroticans

6.  Retested dropped points. All 4 were corrected. Should I also add Chronic
Tonsillitis? What do you mean "when all points are small"? Is that the volume
of sound or the tone?

Was this correct? Do I add other remedies, if so, what? I thought I understood
the protocol. However, when I try to implement, I have a difficult time. Do we
use your correlation list connecting with the organ or system in testing the
remedy? Do I add supportive remedies? if so, what?

I feel like I'm not the brightest bulb in my class since everyone else are
treating multiple clients and understand all the Nosodes!

    Yes, I received it. I understand the theory. It's the implementation that
    I'm having trouble with. 
    Would it be possible to make videotapes of treatment sessions with
    explanations of why particular nosodes and remedies were used? 

    Yes, I've found self measurement to be a challenge, especially with my
    toes. However, I'm the only one around to treat myself. I've found it
    easier to do measurements because I have the time to really listen. With
    others, I feel more of a time pressure.

    Measurement Protocol

    The second half with the meridians and the remedies underneath is the part
    that shows you which remedy is most likely to match.... if that doesn't
    match, you can try the next.... etc.

    The protocol of measurement should not be too hard to understand if you
    start working with it. Just follow the steps and of course there's also
    some learning involved to understand the remedies, meridians, organs.... to
    get a good foundation for your treatments. 

    It is not expected that you know everything at once, so just start and in
    practice you'll find out more and more.... the guideline will prevent you
    from looking in strange directions and testing all remedies on all points,
    you can save that for the more unusual situations where the meridians/
    points don't react on the suggested remedies...

    Jiri:  I also find it awkward to self measure, especially when using my

    Hope that helps.

    very helpful because then I had one hand on the probe and one hand holding
    the toes and that was much easier!  Thanks for these helpful tips!

    Measuring yourself is indeed not as easy as measuring others.

    Yes we need an update on all points. this has long been the challenge for
    starting therapists, and I am happy we sort this once and for all. 
    I have been teaching an extra point the 6thpoint, is above the normal 5th
    point on the index finger Large Intenstine, and on the ring finger TW. I
    have called it " On the side of the nail, and yes sounds so high but in
    practicly it slightly about the corner of the nail. In practice 1-2 mm
    above the other point, Sorry if the words make it sound like different. 
    Some chose not to measure the Index 6th point (the app) and the 6th point
    of the Adrenal glands, which I think is important to include. We do focus
    our therapy on Appendicitis,Tonsillitis and Adrenal Glands

    I can't wait to have more focus on meridian points in future courses.  

    Has Johan made adjustments to the original EAV measurepoints?
    I know Dr. Voll has multiple points but are the ones we have the same on
    the fingers?
    just wondering where to find more information to rely in the flora of
    variety....

    Hi Nora,

    The points that Johan uses are not all points that Voll has identified. He
    is not going to change anything from what he has always taught to measure.
    So on the fingers all points around the knuckles and only on some meridians
    the nail points:

    Large Intestines: Appendix-right, Anus-left
    Lymphatic System: Tonsils
    Hormonal System/Triple Warmer: Gonads-right, Adrenals-left

    These points always have been very important in assessing the condition of
    the client, since Chronic Appendicitis and Chronic Tonsillitis and Adrenal
    Fatigue are so common in chronic conditions.

    On the feet it is easier to look at the maps then describing it. 

    Stomach and Gallbladder are both measured on all 5 point around the
    knuckles. Liver and Pancreas/Spleen are both measured on 4 points (one nail
    point and the others around the knuckles). Bladder 4 points and Kidneys 3
    or 4 points (depending on the difficulty of the toe ;-))

    Karolina, 

    On the feet I would say joint rather than knuckles ( I think we only have
    knuckles on the hands)

    I have reviewed my 2 AC point diagrams: Can you clarify what you wrote
    above i.e. 5 Gallbladder points? Both the diagrams I have have only 4  Is
    the 5th one proximal or distal to the foot? Is it where the toe meets the
    foot like stomach upper part ST43a BUT on the Gallbladder meridian?

    Both my diagrams have only 3 SPLEEN AC points Is the 4th one near the joint
    close to the foot OR distal to the joint farthest from the foot i.e. next
    after nail point? Does the spleen have 4 points on each foot?

    Maybe this should come under a new heading i.e. AC POINTS?

    Thanks! Toril

    Around the joints is probably more correct... some people do have knuckles
    on their feet though ;-)

    The fifth Gallbladder point that you're probably missing is the one closest
    to the body of the foot, where the toe ends and the foot begins.
    So yes.... like the jaw point on the stomach meridian, but then on the
    Gallbladder meridian.

    The fourth Spleen/Pancreas point is proximal (close to the foot).

    Karolina: The description that you give for number of toe points appears to
    be different from the foot and hand charts that Johan sent out last week.
    The hand charts show only 5 points (not 6 points) on the TW, LI, and Lymph.
    Only 3 points on the spleen. Only 4 points on the GB. Is the extra spleen
    point all the way on the other side of the ball of the foot (just as the
    proximal bladder point is all the way around the ball of the foot)? Are
    those extra hand points so close to the regular points that they are
    measured as one, especially on small hands?

    Would it be possible to update the hand and foot charts so they reflect the
    location of ALL the points we are to measure? That way we can all be
    working off the same chart during a session and report our case studies on
    the forum by stating, for example "points 3, 5, and 6 on TW dropped"?

    It would also be nice to have the meaning of the extra points that are not
    on the current charts. Such as the 4th spleen point once I figure out where
    it is located. :)

    Thanks.

    Hi Renate,

    * I'm not happy with the cards being incomplete either. Johan sent the
    right cards to Schwab, with all points drawn into them (even fatty tissue,
    bones etc) , but a lot got lost in translation apparently...  What probably
    happened is that Chrystynes drawings of the hand and feet, with the points
    that she put in them on the computer, were used and not Johan's hand drawn
    maps. Sloppy not to notice, I know.... another thing we have to correct. 

    * We never measure two points as one. 

    * The 5th point on the Gallbladder is important since that is where you
    measure Gallstones. It is the most proximal point of the toe (upper joint)

    * All finger (not the thumb) meridians have 6 points, although they are not
    described in the map. Only the sixth points of the Triple Warmer and Large
    Intestines are crucial to measure since that's where you find the Adrenals/
    Sex Glands and Anus/Appendix.

    * The Lung and Lymph meridian only has 4 points that we measure

    * The extra Spleen point is not on the proximal joint. In the map there's a
    point missing below the nail point and above the joint.

    * You could give points a number but for clarity on the forum I'd like
    everybody to name the most important points. Especially if they're on the
    Triple Warmer. "Adrenal Point" is much easier to read than "Point 1 or 6
    TW". I also like to request everybody to spell out the remedy and meridian
    names. 
    The forum should not be like a puzzle to students who are just starting to
    learn all names (or to us!)  and it is so much nicer to read Appendicitis
    Necroticans than AppNcr. for example. You can just glance over it without
    having to fill in the blanks... Also medical terms are not as natural to
    everybody as they are to students/practitioners with a medical background,
    so when used it would be nice to put a small explanation between brackets.

    * Not all meanings for every point are known, Voll left some blanks in his
    research and Johan hasn't found out everything either. Knowing to what
    organs/systems those blank points pertain is enough information.

    Thanks Renate for bringing this up as I was also wondering about the
    information being different. 

    Karolina do you think it would be possible for us to have a copy of Johan's
    hand drawn maps?  That would be wonderful if it is possible and would
    really help clarify locations with a picture.  Thanks much!

    The sixth points of Triple Warmer and Large Intestine ( Adrenals/Sex
    Glands, Anus/Appendix) and the 4th point on Lymphatic are located next to
    the nail bed. These points are so close to the next joint point that it is
    hard on most hands to see the difference between these two points. Is the
    angle of measurement of these points should be the same?

    The nail points you have to measure with the pen in an angle of 90 degrees
    with the finger. This way the angle with the bone is also 90 degrees.

    Around the joints it is more like a 45 degree angle pointing towards the
    joint. This way again you have a 90 degree angle with the surface of the
    bone.

    Hi Jan,

    Since everybody wants to know what all points mean and since the points
    that are left out have no known meaning (not to Voll and not to Johan).
    Johan decided not to update them on the map.

    There are points around every joint where I described them and I do measure
    them (it is extra information..), but they are not part of protocol. 
    You can skip them if you want to, but there's no harm in measuring them
    either. It is a matter of choice.

    Answers:
    1.This is not how Biontology works. Using a Cancer remedy and repeating it
    is not going to solve the underlying condition that caused Cancer.

    * Cancer is a Symptom, it is never a Cause
    * A Tumor is the result of many regulatory processes in the body going
    wrong.
    * Metastases means the underlying Cause continues its degenerative path.
    * When the bodily processes have been corrected, the body might clean up
    the Tumor.

    This is why the procedure of treatment should always directed towards the
    underlying condition of the body that caused Cancer and not to the Tumor
    itself.

    2. When Carcinoma Uteri matches this might be an indication that the
    Thyroid was malfunctioning. Since you measured Whiplash this means the
    Thyroid indeed dropped.

    3. This is not correct. I have never measured a resonance with a Cancer
    remedy on the Bones even if there actually is Bone Cancer. 
    Also the Organ Degeneration should not be a focus at all. Cancer is no
    different than other diseases, the protocol should be followed and the
    Organ Degeneration meridian is not important at all to focus on. It always
    drops initially since the condition of the Organ Degeneration meridian
    reflects the amount of Toxins in the body. Toxins will automatically be
    eliminated when you follow the order of treatment provided in the protocol.
    Every biophoton session stimulates the body to detoxify.
   
    4. Since Cancer is a Symptom you should not have used Adenoma Prostata/
    Carcinoma Uteri/Carcinoma Hepatis in this stage of treatment. This diverts
    the body's energy away from healing the Appendicitis and other underlying
    Causes. The Cancer is irrelevant, first the Causes need to be removed. 
    Causes are removed by treating the relevant meridians in the right
    sequence. 

    The Liver should never be treated at all until the Yang meridians and
    Kidneys are balanced! Fortunately your client did not experience severe
    reactions, but when you treat the Liver too soon this is definitely a risk.
    First the elimination pathways should be cleared, and even if you don't
    treat the Liver directly it will start detoxification from the first
    session.

    When someone has been diagnosed with Cancer, the first session I only try
    to measure with the Cancer remedies to assess if there is a resonance with
    it and with what type of Cancer, so I can base my further treatment on it.
    After this I take them out!

    Prostate Enlargement/Cancer is generally similar to Ovarian Cyst/Cancer =>
    this is always the result of a very bad Circulation whereby the Veins are
    incapable of pumping back fluids causing them to sink to the lower parts of
    the body.
    Bad Circulation can be caused by:
    Veins that don't work properly => Calcium deposits between the Valves 
    (Barijodeel and/or Aurumheel)  and/or by lack of Strength in the Valves
    (Selenium, Berberis, Hamamelis and Mellilotus) 

    Pain in the knee is often caused by malfunctions of the Bladder system to
    which the Prostate also belongs.

    Carcinoma Hepatis, Carcinoma Uteri are two Cancers of a very different type
    than a Prostate Cancer… so I wonder where you have measured them. 
    It is really difficult to give specific guidance with the lack of
    information as to which remedy matched on what point(s).

    The Bladder drops can often be dealt with with one or more of the
    Intestinal Bacteria.
    Bacterium Proteus (which you seem to have measured… where?) often causes
    Prostatitis, or causes infection of the Urinary Tract. These infections can
    also be caused by the other Intestinal Bacteria. When I measure one, I use
    the other 3 as Support.

    Focus is the most important advise I can give you!!!

    Thank you very much for a very complete answer.

    1) In the first session I did measure for Carc Hepatis on the organ
    degeneration meridian but did not treat with it. Should I have measured the
    cancer on the sex gland point or bladder meridian?

    2) All cancer remedies were matched on the organ degeneration meridian. I
    treated with the remedies on the 2nd treatment since it took away most
    drops. If I should not have used them at this point then how and when are
    these nosodes used?

    3) I measured Myom Uteri on the Bladder Meridian. Adenoma Prostata did not
    match. Do I continue to treat with Myom Uteri? Would I then support the
    Thyroid?

    4) Bact Proteus matched on the Bladder Meridian. I will use the all Bact's
    as support next session.

    5) Am I understanding this correctly? My focus is circulation while
    following protocol?

    March 2014 edited March 2014 Flag
    Questions:
    1. Bad circulation can also be caused by cramping of the blood vessels in
    which case Atropinum is the remedy to use.  

    2. Can cramping of the blood vessels also be causal in Prostate Enlargement
    /Cancer and Ovarian Cyst/Cancer?
  •

    1. Yes, if there's Cancer in an organ, the remedy that matches the point
    connected to that organ (in this case the Sex Organ point on the Bladder
    meridian!) shows what kind of Cancer is there. You can measure both Organ
    Degeneration and Bladder meridian, but not Organ Degeneration by itself.
   
    Prostate Adenoma is the result of a Cyst, so Ovarial Cyst would have been a
    more logical thing to match then Carcinoma Hepatis or Myoma Uteri. These
    don't make sense in combination with Prostate Adenoma.
   
    However on the Organ Degeneration meridian all kinds of Cancer can match,
    which doesn't necessarily tell you that this Cancer is really there. Galium
    would probably have balanced the Organ Degeneration meridian too, as this
    meridian mainly shows Toxicity of the body.

    2. The Cancer Nosodes are not there to remove the Tumors. They are there to
    indicate what types of Tumors there are. Tumors can only be removed by
    correction of the body functions (shown by balance of the meridians) that
    underly the Cancerous process.

    In case of a Fibrous Tumor the Cause is the function of the Thyroid, so for
    the body to get rid of it the Thyroid should be balanced.
    The Thyroid could be disturbed by numerous malfunctions of numerous organ
    systems. The Primary Causes of Thyroid malfunction are: 
    Parathyroid, Pineal, Pituitary, Tonsillarpröpfe, Tonsilltis, Whiplash and a
    malfunction in the Iodine 
    Metabolism.

    In cases of Liver Cancer, there is only one remedy and that is detox of the
    Liver. This will happen automatically by treating the whole body and
    especially the Elimination Organs.

    The Cancer Nosodes can be used as support if you haven't used 8 Nosodes
    already, but this should not have your main focus. Also Carcinoma Hepatis
    treats the Liver directly and you should only do this when the Yang Organs
    and Kidneys are functioning well enough to handle it.

    3. His Prostate is gone but there is (was) a Cyst. What could match is
    Ovarial Cyst.
    Myom Uteri could perhaps indicate Scar Tissue of the surgery or it could
    indicate Polyps, they too could be on the Bladder. Try Polyp Laryngis or
    Polyp Nasalis to verify this.

    5. Circulation is always something to focus on. But for the Prostate
    problem, it is late. 
   
    Lead Poisoning is often mistaken as Bone Cancer. It gives the same pictures
    on MRI and X rays.
    I would try to match this first on the Cartilage/Articular Degeneration
    meridian. Then I would try Calcoheel and Osteoheel.
   
    You should always follow the protocol, irrespective of the disease. The
    order of treatment is very important.

    Carol
    1. Atropinum is an anti-stress remedy. The cramping can be a result of
    stress and can indeed lead to Bad Circulation and the forming of blockages.
    Treatment with the Chiren (by itself, without remedies) already leads to
    relaxation. Very often Atropinum is not even necessary.
    Also, people usually need to change their Lifestyle and Attitudes in order
    to get lasting results.

    2. Yes, this is possible but it is not the most common Cause.

    often causes
    Prostatitis, or causes infection of the Urinary Tract. These infections

    one, I use the other 3 as Support".

    Answer:
    I put them all in as if they were one remedy and then measure where they
    match. If they don't correct anything I won't use them in treatment, but if
    they do match they all become part of the Hand-treatment.

    Understood
    But, then, how do you know which one is resonating where? At the end it
    does  not matter, but how would we know which particular bacteria is
    disrupting certain meridian (from manual only?)?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    April 2014 edited April 2014 Flag
    When you measure the Bacteria together there's no way to know which one
    matches where. But since the Intestinal Flora Bacteria have similar kind of
    symptoms using them together will only add to your focus.
   
    When you measure one of the Intestinal Bacteria on a System that is not the
    Large Intestine, you can safely assume that the environment in the
    Intestines is not welcoming to the Bacteria and that the Flora will be
    creating havoc throughout the body. Each has chosen its particular new
    residence.
   
    So when you treat all of them together, numerous problems might disappear
    as it is quite possible that all of them are causing malfunctions. Some of
    them in the open where you can measure them, other ones might be hidden.
    Not everything that happens in the body is measurable...

    Also, if I only measure one of the Bacteria on the Colon I take this as a
    request for the body to correct the Flora as a whole. So I will use them
    all together. But I always need to measure at least one of them, which
    usually happens when nothing else can be found on the Large Intestine
    anymore.

    The order of measurement on the Large Intestine (R) I use is:

    1) The 3 types of Appendicitis (Necroticans first) => sometimes
    Appendicitis corrects one or two points, and other points are corrected by
    Chronic Appendicitis.

    2) The 2 forms of Tuberculosis

    3) Diverticulosis

    4) The 4 Intestinal Bacteria => because of the double action of these
    Nosodes, you can use them to remove the Bacteria from other organs when it
    is still impossible to reintroduce them to the Colon (because of the
    Intestinal troubles that have not been eliminated yet)

Local Treatment for Appendicitis

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
October 2014 edited October 2014 in Q&A Flag
Question:
Is it possible to use the light rods in the area of the Appendix to repair
diseased tissue just like in a scar treatment?

Answer by Johan:
Local light treatment can always assist in healing, but it would not work the
same as with scar treatment. When we treat external scars the healthy tissue as
well as the unhealthy tissue information is included in the light circuit and
this is important in order for it to be repaired by the body. The disturbing
information of the scar that is taken into the Chiren will be inverted and
given back to the body as to neutralise it. With internal scars and damaged
tissue, getting close enough to it to include it into the light circuit is
obviously not possible.

Furthermore, Appendicitis Necrioticans and Chronic Appendicitis normally do not
restrict themselves to the Appendix, but the condition can affect the Whole
Large and Small Intestine. Local treatment will not reach that whole area.

    Karolina the forum has become a lot more interesting since you have been
    asking questions.

    It makes me ponder; if you treat appendicitis locally with a standard
    program .... would it be more or less effective than treating with rods in
    hands. I would think that it would depend on the amount and quality of
    biophotons emitted. Is there any information on what parts of the body emit
    the most biophotons ? Also when a local area of the body is ill the aura is
    affected in that area so are the biophotons also affected more than say in
    the hands ?

    Any ruminations appreciated.

    Hi Johnty, 

    These excellent questions are not mine but from other practitioners. They
    were submitted for the Q&A with Johan and were answered yesterday. Because
    some practitioners seem to experience problems with receiving e-mails that
    have been sent out through our mailing system ConstatnContact, and thus
    missed yesterday's Q&A, I decided to post both questions and answers.

    I think that because the endpoints of meridians are located on hands and
    feet they are the best location to offer the light as to reach the whole
    body most effectively. 

    (Homeopathic) information seems to reach the whole body no matter where you
    offer it, so it does not really make a difference whether you put it in a
    local treatment or in the hand or footplate treatment. 

    Local treatment with just the light (without remedies) seems to have an
    added effect in local symptom relief. I belief that the specific
    information of the local ailment is very strong in that location and thus
    the "remedy that is made out of that information by inversion", which is
    the basic function of the Chiren will also be very specific and strong for
    that location. This is just my idea about it. Also the opening up of
    blocked local channels may play a role.

    I forgot to answer the most important part of your question. Treating
    appendicitis locally with the >12 years program is far less effective that
    just treating it through the normal hand-treatment. But success depends on
    your overall focus and the use of proper support.

Burnout and Menstrual Symptoms

Henry Northcroft
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Case Discussions - Student Flag
Client:
Female 49 years of age
Mother of 3 sons

Her symptoms:
Heavy menstrual bleeding
Headaches
General tiredness and being run down
Looking wornout

History:
Recent stressful life episode with eldest son being sent to prison
3 sons each delivered with cesarean section between 19 - 27 years ago wih scar
right across abdomen from one side to other
Uterus lasered on 3 occasions over a number of years to stop heavy menstruation

Diagnoses:
No specific diagnosis other than being worn out with low energy
No medication - but doctor tried to put her on Thyroxine which made her sick -
so she stopped taking it

Measurement:
1st session:
Hormonal: Pituitary / Thyroid / Parathyroid / Adrenal points / Thymus dropping
both hands
Large Intestine R/H: Lymphatic / Colon Ascendens
Small Intestine L/H: All points dropping
Gallbladder L/F: 3 points drop
No match for Large Intestine remedies in manual inc. all 3 appendicitus
Match on Salmonella Typhi for Small Intestine

Treatment: Whiplash then Salmonella Typhi / Nux Vomica / Berberis / Reneel /
Little Flanel Flower / Atropinum
Result: Most points no longer dropping immediately after - but she has
headaches for two days after - days 2-3

2nd Session (5 days later):
Hormonal: All points not dropping except Adrenal Cortex and Medula
Large intestine R/H All points now dropping right hand but still no matches for
remedies in manual
Small intestine L/H: Plexus and Lleum still dropping
Gallbladder L/F: All points dropping
A point on kindey and bladder dropping

Treatment: Match on Adenomyose Gallenblase for all GB points
For this 2nd session we focussed on this and elimination system Atropinum /
Berberis / Selenium / Populus / Nux Vomica
Result: Her menstruation started without pain for first time in 10 years - but
bleeding is heavy - loses a pint in one go - headaches day 2-3 and continuous
menstrual bleeding. Currently in bed. She says she believes there is some kind
of rebalancing going on.

5 questions:
1. if i can't find a match for the large intestine is it ok to proceed with
treating the gallbladder?
2. Where do i look for Large Intestine if no matches on the Large Intestine
remedies in manual?
3. Are any of these remedies likely to cause excessive menstrual bleeding or is
bleeding likely to be part of a rebalancing process?
4. If menstrual bleeding is excessive do i advise to run its course or is there
a treatment for excessive bledding?
5. How do i treat cesarean scaring which is 15 cm across?

Best wishes
Henry

    Hi Henry,

    About the symptoms:
    The heavy menstrual bleeding and the headaches are caused by the
    Gallbladder meridian, since this meridian runs over the ovaries and over
    the head. Treating these symptoms means to have a focus on this meridian.

    A few comments on your treatment:
    1. Scar treatment should always come first
    2. Anti-Tetanus and Poliomyelitis need to be treated the first session, as
    they always show up during the initial -or sometimes second- treatment
    anyway and are very important disturbances to get out of the way.
    3. You need to measure and treat according to protocol, which means trying
    to remedy the layers of focus with nosodes. So this means that you should
    start with measuring nosodes on the Hormone System, since many points were
    dropping there. Pituitary and Parathyroid were in fact dropping (which is
    the most common situation), which shows they did need attention with
    nosodes (most likely Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus)
    4. A complete session for adults consists of a hand treatment + a footplate
    treatment.
    5. You should not forget the Kidneys and Bladder are dropping too. With the
    Large Intestine dropping the matching remedies might be the Intestinal
    Flora Bacteria. But any way you should support the kidney. The Bladder
    point might also be involved with the menstrual bleeding if the Bladder
    point matches to a uterine issue.
    The Kidneys form the second layer and should have focus before all of the
    other layers you directed your attention to. Only after you have balanced
    the Kidneys you can continue with the Large Intestine, then the Small
    Intestine, and only then you address the Gallbladder.

    Answers to your questions:
    1. With 5 of the Large Intestine points dropping on the right hand, the
    indication is still at least Chronic Appendicitis. If this and the other
    Appendicitis nosodes do not match, and Diverticulose and the Intestinal
    Flora do not match either, you can try Tuberculinum or Tuberculinum
    Bovinum. If that does not match you can try Polypus Laryngis or
    Nasalis. These are polyps which could also affect the Intestine, Bladder or
    Uterus.
    The fact that the remedy is made from different polyps does not make a
    difference, they are still polyps.
    Polyps are caused by the Thyroid.
    2. Especially when you have just started treating, it is good to keep in
    mind that I am able to correct almost every single situation with the
    suggested remedies and measurement sequence in the protocol. It would be
    highly exceptional to need something else. But you can always look in the
    Biontology Remedy book for less usual nosodes.
    3. & 4. Excessive menstrual bleeding may be caused by fibroid tumors in the
    Uterus, which is caused by the Thyroid, or other issues of this organ. To
    assess this you measure the Sexual Organ point on the Bladder meridian. The
    Thyroid is clearly a problem and needs to be addressed.
    5. You can treat it in two or three parts. (page 42 of your manual)

    I notice a lot of diagnoses on the forum.
    There are several definitions and thoughts around the content of all the
    diagnosis people recieve.

    Personally I try to avoid too much focus on diagnoses in general !! However
    I do understand they are a must in many cases.
    The above diagnosis is Polyneuropathy, and I am not surprised about Johans
    answer .

    Suggestion:
    Would it be possible for us to include what we mean when we ask about
    specific diagnoses on the forum?
    This in order to prevent the trap of moving away from the client by using a
    diagnosis as common ground of understanding of the pain of the person….

    We don't like diagnoses in general, because every individual that has been

    Nobody has exactly the same symptoms, so supplying a weblink to the

    What we want for the forum is the same we want from a client in the first

    Often people don't even fit the box they were put in by their doctors....
    or in other words, they were misdiagnosed...

    Great to hear from you:) Karolina.
    That was my main objective for posting the link on the forum.

    The first session with a client I always de-adress their diagnoses of they
    bring hvem up as main problems. Otherwise that is polluting the field and

Calcoheel for Parkinson's

madelynlevy
March 2013 edited January 2014 in General Questions Flag
I learned that calcoheel (which contains Calcium Carbonicum) was not to be used
in individuals with Parkinson's diagnosis.
The reason being that the problem is Calcium Deposits on the neurons, resulting
in interruption of signals via that neuron pathway. Thus, adding Calcium would
be detrimental. 
Barjodeel and Aurumheel are the 2 I use for Calcium Metabolism. Calcoheel is
listed under "connective tissue" in the protocol with the amending note (only
in Parkinson's). Am I incorrect in my understanding or is there a mistype in
the protocol?

    Where did you get this explanation of Parkinson's? Calcium Deposits on the
    neurons doesn't make sense at all. If in doubt the Protocol is the
    reference to follow.

    The whole Protocol Johan developed is experience-based and the theories on
    what happens in the body developed later. What Johan has noticed is, that
    while in Parkinson's Disease there is often a Para-Thyroid problem and
    Circulatory Calcification (Barijodeel and Aurumheel matches), there is
    often a need for Calcoheel in the Tissues. Because this contains a lower
    potency of Calcium it would mean that there's a shortage of Calcium in the
    tissues (or in any case a need for calcium to relief the imbalance
    experienced there), while at the same time there are deposits in the
    Circulation.

    Calcium balance is a very complicated thing. Here you can read some
    paradoxes. A deficiency of Calcium can lead to Calcium deposits......
    Supplementation with factory created Calcium is never a good thing though,
    the body can't use this properly and it might even disrupt this delicate
    balance of Calcium even more. Eating Calcium (and vitamin D) rich food
    seems to be a good idea.

    In any case it is the Calcium Metabolism and distribution that is off and
    that have to be worked on.

    I asked about  the use of Calcoheel in Parkinson's because of the
    explanation I received from Johan in discussing my husband's case.  Perhaps
    I misunderstood, though what I took away from the discussions was to treat
    Calcium Metabolism and resultant Deposits of Calcium throughout the
    Circulatory and Nervous Systems, and to never add Calcium in Parkinson's;
    thus I have never tested Calcoheel as a Support for my husband.

    Other calcium metabolism supports always resonate, and I have had no need
    to even try Calcoheel. The explanation of why Tremors are so difficult to
    impact in Parkinson's disease was explained by Johan as due to inability to
    rid the Neurons of the Calcium which is Deposited on them, which is the
    cause of Tremors. Perhaps the explanation was Specific to my husband's
    case, though that was not my understanding/misunderstanding. 

    I am currently treating another individual with Parkinson's disease, and
    despite helping with many symptoms. her tremors have never been Impacted by
    the Chiren therapy. Will post her case when time allows. 
     
    Since  Calcium can be deposited in soft tissues such as Kidneys, also,
    resulting in Kidney Stones,  I always check for those.  
    Thanks for the reference. Interesting man and theories/explanations.

    Treating the Calcium Metabolism in case of Parkinson's Is the right thing
    to do. 
    Calcium deposits on Neurons are never measured. However when there are
    Calcium Deposits in the Tissues, this has an effect on Neuronal
    function....

    I asked Johan again to be sure, but he says Circulation and Tissues... not
    Neurones. Calcoheel, Osteoheel or Barijodeel is sometimes measured on the
    Tissue Meridian in case of Parkinson's. But Calcification can also be found
    in the Circulation, in the form of Kidney Stones or sometimes Gall Stones.

    Again, the Remedies that have been found most useful are found Experience
    Based. And Low Potency means there's a need for the substance in Johan's
    explanation about Homeopathic Information. So measuring Calcoheel in the
    Tissues would mean there's a need for Calcium there (Calcium
    Supplementation is not the solution and will aggravate things!), but the
    cause is a Disturbed Calcium Metabolism mainly due to the Para-Thyroid that
    is out of Balance. 

    So the only thing we know for sure is that in Parkinson's Disease there's
    an Issue with the Calcium Metabolism and that Treating this is what needs
    to be done... 

    With the Helicopter View Assessment that is needed for Biontology, going
    into too much detail about Biochemistry can be distracting. Although I like
    a little bit Zooming In, but always make sure I Zoom out again ;-)

    To be of assistance with your Client, I need more information and wait to
    read your next post on her case.

    Question: 
    The shaking was always on the Left Hand/Foot and now sometimes the Right
    Hand/Foot takes it over and starts to shake while the Left side stops
    shaking. 
    Is this effect seen before while treating 'Parkinson' cliënts?

    My opinion: Torture device for women. Violence against the body....

    I write this from my own experience. Years ago a therapist advised me to
    use a copper spiral since it was "found to be" the least harmful birth
    control method. It threw my cycle off balance, caused my periods to be late
    and extremely heavy with lots of blood and clots. I removed it after the
    first month, but it took me literally years before I had a normal
    menstruation again.

    The Copper (Heavy Metal!) is released in the Uterus and throws off Hormonal
    Balance. Copper level has a lot of influence on Female Hormones. 

    Birth Control by Hormones of course also blocks the natural Balance in a
    Female body. This is never Healthy... 

    I feel that every method of Birth Control that tempers with the Female
    Cycle is destructive to the Harmony of the Body... When there's no Allergy
    to Latex... my advice: use a Condom. 
    Or else try to follow the Menstrual Cycle and don't have sex on the most
    fertile days. Johan says that there has been research which proves that
    when Sun and Moon make the same Angle in the Sky as they did on the day of
    your birth you are most Fertile... or least Fertile.... have to ask again..

    Women have two Fertility Cycles: 
    * One of maximum fertility 
    * One of minimum fertility.

    Minimum Fertility ==> is determined by the Menstruation-Ovulation Cycle. 
    Maximum Fertility ==> is determined by the Sun and the Moon. 

    Every time the Sun and the Moon make the same Angle as on the moment of the
    birth of the woman, the woman is most Fertile. This can happen during the
    menstruation! 
    The days before and after this moment also belong to the cycle of maximum
    fertility. 
   
    Information on your personal moment can be obtained from various websites
    where you can order your calendar for the next year. The periods of maximum
    fertility are indicated on this calendar. If you then also indicate your
    menstruation-ovulation cycle, you know your safe days.

    My experience with IUD's is also only negative, the hormonal ones seem to
    be the worst.

Recruiting New Clients

Candace Hsiao Young
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Biontology Business Flag
I have somewhat exhausted my own family members as volunteers. I would like to
continue learning through experience and by working with actual people.

Questions:
1. Any advice on how to recruit clients as a chiren practioner? Can anyone
share their experience and offer suggestions?
2. I am not sure I can charge since I am not fully certified. 
3. I feel that not being certified makes it less likely to get willing clients,
even without charging fees.
4. Will there ever be the possibility of interning with Certified
Biontologists.

    Answers:
    1. I think that for everyone it is different how they start. Personally I
    was already treating strangers when I was still in training. When you meet
    someone, often the conversation naturally goes in the direction of what you
    are doing, and then people would always be fascinated right away. I think
    there is hardly anyone living today who does not have some health
    concern... And then when you get results, and you are still treating for
    free it is very easy to get referrals. I never made a secret out of still
    being a student. The results you get is what matters. And because of the
    results, you will be able to get people who are willing to pay.
    Most important is to let as many people as possible know about what you are
    doing and what results you have already seen.
   
    2. Charging has nothing to do with certification. There are many
    practitioners who did not choose to certify themselves, have full practices
    and are doing very well. 
    When you feel confident and see that clients have results you can start to
    charge an amount that feels comfortable. The Chiren is very powerful by
    itself, and even people without training will be able to help clients
    experience improvements that were not obtainable in other therapies. 
    Maybe because you sticked to treating your family, which is experienced as
    difficult by some practitioners, you did not get to see what you are
    already capable of doing with the Chiren. 
   
    3. I have never seen that this is a real issue. Practitioners are always
    their own biggest advertiser. The only difference certification makes is
    that people will also come to you through the biontology website, but this
    is never enough to build your whole practice on. 
   
    4. Certified Biontologist are independent practitioners and have to decide
    for themselves if they like to offer this or not.

    If you work in line with the instructions in your manual, you should not
    worry about harming clients. Biontology is actually quite safe if you just
    follow the protocols. Harm has only been done (at least in all the cases
    that were brought to our attention) by practitioners who diverted from
    Johan's system of treatment.

    I understand that you have not found your confidence in treating yet as you
    only had your family to practice on. Maybe you can start with treating only
    those clients that you feel comfortable with, and refer more problematic
    cases (very weak and sensitive clients) to a certified Biontologist. When
    you start to see results, your confidence will grow. Practicing is the most
    important part of the training and no one can do it for you unfortunately.

then to copy it here under my personal account.

Client:
A woman in her 60s, I have only talked to her on the phone.
She is coming to my office this afternoon. I will follow the standard protocol
of evaluation.
If you have any suggestions please notify me.

Symptoms:
"Peripheral Neuropathy" => since abdominal surgery
Constant headaches => stemming from feet all the way to the head
"Diabetes type 2" => but cannot take medication for it because of allergy

Medical Diagnoses:
Peritonitis,
Diverticulitis,
Intestinal blockage => after 4 days of not having a bowel movement she takes
laxatives

    This was Johan's response:

    Question: Abdominal surgery for what? 

    * Neuropathy is mainly caused by bad peripheral circulation. 
    - the blood vessels can be blocked by calcium 
    - or they may be cramped because of gallbladder problems => also
    responsible for the headaches. 
   
    * Intestinal problems are likely caused by appendicitis. 
   
    * Of course is treating the Scars the first thing you have to do, they
    could be the cause of the "neuropathy" and can also give a lot of stress
    (Gallbladder).

    Janet's update:

    Session:
    Whiplash Treatment, 
    Spin-Inversion Treatment 
    Anti-Tetanus 

    Measurement:
    Small Intestine (L) - 2 points
    Circulation (L) - 1 point
    Nervous System (L) - 2 points
    Large Intestine (L) - 1 point
    Large Intestine (R) - 4 points
    Circulation (R) - 3 points 
    Heart (R) - 1 point

    Spleen - 3 points
    Liver (L) - 1 point
    Gallbladder (L) - 3 points
    Pancreas - 1 point
    Liver (R) - 2 points
    Stomach (R) - 2 points
    Gallbladder (R) - 1 point
    Bladder (R) - 2 points

    (I NEVER HAD A CLIENT WHO HAD SO MANY POINTS SHOW UP) 

    2nd and 3rd Measurement:
    After the normal and short treatment phase the Circulation and Intestine
    points cleared up. 
    I decided that I could not do anymore because of her condition and age.

    Results:
    * She called me the next morning and said that she had the worse night ever
    and that she is now seeing a medical doctor before she makes another
    appointment with me. 

    Question:
    I have always had positive feedback from my clients. So I need some help
    with this client.

    * If so many points are dropping, then the indication is first Appendicitis
    (Acute, Chronic, Necroticans) and Tonsillitis (Acute, Chronic). These
    inflammations can affect each and every organ system. Her earlier
    diagnostics also indicate this.

    * Further I notice you use only the Standard Hand Treatment and a Short
    Program. For adults the protocol is one >12 year Standard Hand Treatment
    and one Dyslexia/Footplate Treatment. 
    So NO short program in between or a short program instead of the Footplate
    Treatment!

    * I can't see what remedies you have used, but since she has already
    problems with her Gallbladder what you have done probably has made the
    stress on the body even bigger. 
    No Liver remedies or Heavy Metals or Toxins (neutralisation of medication)
     should be used in the first treatment. First the excretion organs should
    function, otherwise the Toxins can go nowhere and will only cause more
    stress.

    In response to the 82 year old lady who had so many drops. 
    On the initial visit I did put Appendicitis in the Chiren. 
    If she makes another appointment with me I will be sure to also include
    tonsillitis. 
    I received a letter from her the other day in which she stated that she is

Food Allergies

EsterReitsma
October 2014 edited October 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
This case is about me:
27 year old female

Symptoms: 
Abdominal pain => starting 5-6 hours after eating certain foods

History:
Life long history of abdominal pain starting at early age, around 5 years old.

1st session with Johan => I remember he found Appendicitis Necroticans 

Following sessions by myself => with difficulty at first, but treating others
helped me to treat myself better too

Measurement and Treatment:
Since december last year my body was clear of drops except for the Large
Intestine (R)

Large Intestine (R) is a real challenge. This is what I have done:
=> treated all kinds of food poisonings several times just to make sure that
there wasn't 
     anything chronic still on my intestines. 
=> worked my way through all the stages of Appendicitis, but the Large
Intestine kept dropping
=> treated all Toxins, all kind of diseases 
=> at one point I was so desperate, that I measured all nosodes and treated
with the ones 
     that matched. I did this several times but I couldn't manage to get my
Large Intestine 
     balanced. 
=> tried to use Liver support as I thought the Liver could have influenced my
Large Intestine 
     according to the 5 element teaching, but it did not work
=> I treated more than ones with Schwefheel and Psorium for possible treatment
resistance. 

Other therapies used:
Herbal mix (with arthemesia) => against worms => after this my Large Intestine
doesn't drop anymore => but abdominal pain did not go away

I noticed the same now with a client that I have (life-long abdominal
complaints + food allergies + no drops on her intestines anymore, but no change
in allergy symptoms)
 
Diagnoses:
Allergy test (prescribed by an orthomolecular doctor) => From the 270 foods
tested, I was allergic to 90 (certain allergies, like eggs and nuts, were
really severe) 
This test diagnoses slow antibodies. Not the ones that get triggered the moment
you put the allergen in your mouth, but antibodies that your body makes when
the food is getting in to the blood stream. 

Since the allergy test I have left all allergens out of my diet => my abdominal
pain went away

I hoped that when I would give my body some rest for a couple of months I would
be able to eat everything again but now I still have the allergies still as bad
as they were before. 

Questions:
1. I didn't expect to have any allergies since I have a lot of faith in
Biontology, why do I have so many allergies after all these treatments?

2. Am I missing something, and is there anything I can do about this?

I would really appreciate all your insights and help!

    As Johan would say, Allergies are a symptom of underlying infection.  

    I believe, as you treated yourself, you allowed for more expression
    (release) of the internal problems, ie toxins. You used the herbs to kill
    off the superficial level but it failed to change the 'dynamics' of your
    body to repel the pathogens. This is the principle of homeopathy of
    treating the terrain. It's not to say that herbs can't treat the terrain. I
    do think that Chinese herbs, when given in proper amounts and proper
    combination and sequence, can 'educate' terrain, but this is not how
    symptomatic herbal use, as you did, works. 

    If you change your perspective about 'allergies' and look at your body as
    being in resonance with the 'pathogens', then you may see that your body/
    energy needs a change its resonance so as to NOT resonate with these
    'aggravants' .

    I recommend starting over with this in mind.

    I do not use or rely on information of allergy tests, because I have no
    confidence in them.
    An allergic reaction is a reaction of mucous membranes that are already
    irritated. 

    Comments on your 5-element interpretation:
    It is not Wood (the Liver) that destroys Metal (the Large Intestine), but
    the other way around. The Large Intestine influences the Liver negatively.

    The Large Intestine (Metal Element) is negatively influenced by the Fire
    Element (Small Intestine and Heart).

    The fact that you get abdominal pain approx 5-6 hours after eating,
    indicates that there is a problem in your Small Intestine and not in your
    Large Intestine. You have about 7 meters Small Intestine and 1,5 meters of
    Large Intestine.

    Abdominal pain after eating can indicate several things:
    1. Damaged mucous membranes
    2. Gas formation that is temporarily stuck in the intestines 

    Damaged mucous membranes:
    The fact that there is pain may indicate ulcers.
    The location of the damage will be further down the Small Intestine than
    the Duodenum, because after 5-6 hours the food has already passed the
    Duodenum. 

    Gas formation:
    Gas that is stuck causes pressure pain, the moment the gas goes again, the
    pain is gone.
    Gas formation is a Gallbladder problem, and not an allergic reaction
    Certain foods are known to create a lot of gas, it would be interesting to
    know if perhaps these are the culprits

    * Look at what you measured on Hormone System?

    * Did you measure/treat Whiplash? This could disturb energy flow through
    the Thyroid gland.

    * Most likely there is a Thyroid malfunction that was resolved after
    balancing Pineal/Pituitary and the Thyroid itself. 

    * Did Strumeel matched on Thyroid (correlation with Small Intestine, iodine
    was biounavailable because of inflammation)?

    * Did you clear Tonsillitis point on Lymphatic system? Chronic Tonsillitis
    might affect Thyroid functioning too. Did you measure Strep and/or Staph?
    It could affect the Heart meridian too (in addition to Tonsils).

    All of the above might have had an impact.

    There is not enough information in your case. I need to see measurements. 

    What I notice is that you do not treat in the right sequence. The YANG
    organs need to be clear before you treat the YIN organs. Thus the Heart
    should come later than the Small Intestine.

    As far as the body temperature is concerned:
    * A slight drop and rise in body temperature could also indicate a low
    grade or chronic inflammation or infection. The suppression of the
    infection might be lifted due to the treatment, causing the temperature to
    go up.

    * There are many possible reasons for his temperature issues, but without
    your measurements we cannot say much about possible causes and the sequence
    in which to treat

Classical Homeopathy

November 2015 edited November 2015 in Therapy Questions Flag
Client:
Woman who has been working with a Naturopathic Doctor for the last year. She is
taking Unda number compounds, and is not willing to stop taking them.
She has seen over 25 doctors in the last 7 years and this is the only treatment
that she has seen results in.  

I am going to send her the article you wrote explaining the difference between
single homeopathic remedies and Biontology. 

Question
Is this an issue to work with her while she is taking the Unda remedies and
will it effect her measurements?

    Unda remedies are in conflict with classical homeopathy, since it is not
    just one remedy in one potency that is given, but a complex of many
    remedies in low potencies. As far as I can see Unda is complex homeopathy
    and the remedies are similar to the Compositae from Heel. 

    Answer
    It will not only affect the measurements, it will affect the treatment
    outcome.

    Any additional information that is given outside of the biophoton treatment
    will disrupt the balance that you create by measuring and treating. If
    there is no drop anymore on the systems you are treating/focussing on, than
    the only things that can happen are: 
    1. The remedy does nothing and the points stay balanced
    2. The remedy causes points to drop again or new points to drop

    If she is unwilling to let go of these remedies, I would load them in the
    Chiren and use them in a similar way as the Compositae. This way she still
    gets them, and even more effective because only the components that are
    truly supportive in the remedy will be given (because of the filter).

    Thank you very much for that very thorough explanation. This is the first
    time that this situation has occurred for me. I know she will not be
    willing to not take those remedies outside of the Chiren. Maybe it is just
    not her time to work with the Chiren. I sense a big control piece.
   
    Question
    Is it right for me to assume that if she was taking classical homeopathy
    that it would also effect the measurements and the treatment outcome?

    Update

    Recent medical interventions:
    3 teeth extracted => replaced with ceramic dental implants (3 months ago)

    Current symptoms:
    Gums stopped bleeding (2 months ago)
    Pain in jaw and gums => less but still present
    Vaginal pain (outside skin) => comes and goes
    Runny nose
    Itching inside ears and nose
    Exhaustion

    Treatment:

    1st Measurement: 
    No drops 
   
    Attempt to lower Endorphins:
    Measured with Atropinum, Viscum, Plumbum => no drops 
    2-7 Years Program with Atropinum, Viscum, Plumbum => 2 Liver points dropped
   
    2nd Measurement:
    Liver - Hepatitis B 
   
    >12 Years Program:
    Hepatitis B, Kieforstitis, Granuloma Denti, Myristica Seferbia,
    Chelidonium, Lymfomyosot, Hepar 
   
    3rd Measurment:
     Liver - Hepatitis A non B 
   
    Footplate Treatment: 
    Hepatitis A non B, Hepatitis A, Galium, Glyoxal, Selenium, Nux Vomica,
    Ferrum, Hepeel 
   
    Effects 1 day after Treatment:
    Cold arms => located on Hormone System and Large Intestine meridians
    Tingeling sensation on face => located on Galbladder and Stomach meridian 
    Sweaty hands and feet 
    Abdominal gas 
    Weakness
    Lower backache 
   
    Questions: 
    1. 2 liver points dropped just a little bit. Could it still be endorphins
    or something else hiding more drops? I feel there should be more drops. 
    2. Because of the sweaty hands and feet I have treated with Tuberculinum
    before, but it did not help.
    3. I eat spinach everyday. It says on the package that its washed. I do not
    wash them. Can I get Toxoplasmose or other parasites all the time from
    that? Since I still have moist on hands?
    4. How often should I treat?

    I would also like to know when you started eating spinach every day... 
    Due to the high oxalate content in spinach in combination with a
    longstanding intestinal problem and lack of healthy intestinal flora, which
    causes a lack of break down of oxalate in the gut, you might have acquired
    symptoms of oxalate poisoning of which vulvodynia (external female genital
    pain/irritation) is one.

    I have eaten spinach every day the last years. I have had pain in skin
    outside vagina for 10 years.
    Should I stop eating spinach every day and switch to salad mix? 
  •

    It was just a possible correlation I thought of, something that may be a
    factor in your symptoms... There is a lot of oxalate in many foods, not
    only in spinach. If you stop eating the spinach and eat salad mix for a
    while you can observe if it does make a difference. Calculi Renales
    contains calcium oxalate and may be measured and be used to help expel
    possible excess oxalate. 
   
    Oxalate is also present in many other food sources, e.g.
    Nuts like almonds
    Rhubarb 
    Beets
    Swiss chard
    Soy
    Quinoa
    Chocolate
    Black tea
    Berries

    1. With your symptoms there should be more drops, so most likely there are
    still endorphins. However, your sweaty hands/feet could also cause
    unreliable measurement and be the reason for the lack of drops.
    2. If Tuberculinum did not help, it is not likely to be the reason. You
    will need to look for other possible reasons. It would be best to not look
    for remedies but for systems that could cause the sweaty hands and feet.
    But this poses a problem since the sweat might prevent accurate
    measurements... Try if drying your hands before measuring a point helps.
    3. I have never seen Toxoplasmose food poisoning being caused by eating
    spinach or salad, and I do not think that your sweating is caused by any
    parasite or food poisoning. You need to find out which organ systems may be
    the cause. Possibly it is your Kidneys or Circulation that causes the
    sweating.
    4. You should not treat more than once a week.

    I will keep that in mind for my next treatment. 

    Questions
    If I have wet hands and few drops, should I first try a 2-7 program with
    Tuberculinum and see if the hands get dry and drops start showing? I have
    Tried that, and sometimes I get more drops this way. But I still have wet
    hands again the next treatment. I have even Tried it some treatments in a
    row.

    Wet hands and feet are always a problem when measuring. The wetness
    prevents often accurate measurements.

    Answer:
    When you have tried Tuberculinum and this does not appear to work, a
    different approach by focussing on causal organ systems may be the answer. 
    Organ systems that could lead to sweaty hands are for example Kidneys and
    Circulation.

    Update:
    I felt so bad that I panicked and treated myself. 

    Symptoms:
    Ice-cold feeling along Large Intestine and Hormone System meridians on arms
    Sweating (especially hands and feet)
    Flu-like feeling
    Exhaustion
    Overall coldness 
    Painful gums
    Anxiety
    Pressure and pain in the Tonsil area of the throat => makes it hard to
    breath
    Difficulty sleeping
    Coughing
    Cold feeling in one tooth

    1st Measurement (dried fingers and toes with towel before each
    measurement): 
    Large Intestine (R) - 2 points => Appendicitis Nectroticans
    Lymphatic System - ear point => Chronic Tonsillitis
    Stomach => Granuloma Denti
   
    >12 Yrs Treatment:
    Appendicitis Necroticans, Chronic Tonsillitis, Granuloma Denti,
    Kieferostitis, Myristica Sebifera, Chelidonium, Nux Vomica, Anginheel
   
    2nd Measurement:
    Large Intestine (R)  => Chronic Appendicitis
    Lymphatic System => Tonsillitis
    Stomach => corrected by previous nosodes
   
    Footplate Treatment:
    Chronic Appendicitis, Tonsillitis, Appendicitis, Selenium, Tonsilla
    Compositum, Hepar, Lymphomyosot, Solidago
   
    Reaction first 24 hours:
    Flu-like feeling involving sinuses, ears, mouth, nose, tonsils
    Runny nose
    Sore tonsils
    Sneezing
    Headache (top, front and sides) => went away after drinking lots of water
   
    Questions: 
    1. I drink alot of coffe and tea. Should I try stopp drinking that for a
    period? 
    2. Do you have any advices for further treatments or comments on my
    treatment? 
    3. When you have a headace, do you only look for the meridian on the point
    that is causing pain? 
    4. Is headace on the top of the head, and on the forehead only caused by
    Bladder merridian?
    5. Is there anything in these measurements that can cause sweaty hands? I
    did not measure anything on Kidneys and Circulation...

    Answers
    1. I do think that it is better that you stop drinking coffee and tea for a
    while to see what it brings.
    2. The symptoms and measurement indicate an infection of the mucous
    membranes
    In the treatment I see that you treat with the inflammation nosodes.
    Perhaps you
    should try to find out what causes the inflammation. You can for example
    try to find the bacteria that
    might be responsible for infections. It could be Food Poisoning or a Strep/
    Staph bacteria.
    3. & 4. Cause of headaches is generally the meridian that runs there, but
    it might also
    be caused by something that is located underneath the meridian. In some
    cases
    I have found it to be the Hormonal Glands that are located in the head. Or
    in
    other cases I found there to be drops on the Nervous System. But if the
    measurements are not accurate, which is very possible in your condition, I
    have no idea to give any advice.
    5. The fact that you have sweaty hands, the sense of cold everywhere and
    the
    headache might be that the Hypothalamus is not in order. The Hypothalamus
    is
    responsible for the temperature regulation of the body. According to Voll,
    this
    gland is measured on the same point as the Pituitary gland but I have never
    checked this.

    Response:
    1.Yes, I will try that.
    3 & 4. Thats very good to know, thank you.
    5.The weird thing is that I am only cold on the arms where the Large
    Intestine and Hormone System meridian run, but nowhere else.

    Reactions to Treatment:
    Headache on top of the head => lasted 12 hours, but went away after
    drinking water
    Flu symptoms => sinuses, ears, gums, sore tonsils, runny nose and fever =>
    still mildly present 

    Current Symptoms:
    Lymph glands armpits/groin => pressure and itching
    Tingeling sensation => on Gallbladder and Hormone System meridian on the
    face
    Sweaty hands and feet => on and off
    Burning pain in the vagina
    Pain located around the appendix
    Coldness in arms => along the Large Intestine and Hormone System meridian
    Minor pain in the heart area sometimes
    Painful gums => improved to the point that I only have pain between some
    teeth when using dental floss

    Session (6 days after last one) 

    Measurement:
    Parathyroid => Varicellen
    Lymphatic System (ear, sinuses) => Chronic Tonsillitis, Tonsillitis
    Stomach (1 point) => Kieferostitis
    Gallbladder (1 point) => corrected by remedies above

    >12 yrs program:
    Varicellen, Chronic Tonsillitis, Tonsillitis, Kieferostitis, Granulomi
    Denti, Myristica Sebifera, Chelidonium, Anginheel 

    2nd Measurement:
    Large Intestine (1 point) => Appendicitis
    Stomach (jaw point) => Leptospirose ( Staph and Strep did not match)

    Foot Treatment:
    Appendicitis, Leptospirose, Nux Vomica, Solidago, Lymfomyosot, Tonsilla
    Comp, Duodenoheel, Veratrum
     
    Reactions first 24 hours: 
    Itching inside nose, gums and sinuses
    Diarrhea. 

    Questions: 
    1. During the first treatment I chose to focus on Hormone System, Lymphatic
    System and Stomach, when I then measured, the Large Intestine dropped and
    Appendicitis matched. I felt that I had to treat Appendicitis and
    Tonsillitis together. 
    Did I focus enough? I thought that focus should be on a maximum of 3 Organ
    Systems, but I did treat the Large Intestine, because I don't want the
    Appendix to go back to the chronic condition again and this comes before
    the Stomach in the protocol. Was it OK to do this?
   
    2. My hands and feet were sweaty on and off this week. When I started to
    measure myself my hands were dry, but during the process they became a bit
    sweaty again (dried them when needed to get better measurements. Does this
    indicate anything? 
   
    3. I remember getting sweaty hands after treatment a while back ago and you
    said that this was a good reaction as it shows the body is cleansing. So I
    am a bit confused now, does the sweating mean that something is wrong or is
    it a good response?

    4. You wrote: "You should try to find out what causes the inflammation. You
    can for example try to find the bacteria that might be responsible for
    infections. It could be Food Poisoning or a Strep/Staph bacteria." 
    Does this mean I should measure for bacteria on all the dropping points
    instead of inflammation nosodes? If I measure drops on the Lymphatic
    System, should I try bacteria first instead of Tonsillitis? Or did you mean
    only on the Stomach points?

    5. Do you have further recommendations for treatment?

    Symptoms after last session:
    Sleepiness => desire to sleep all the time + trouble keeping awake =>
    lasted 5 days
    Energy on day 6
    Craving coffee and chocolate all the time
    Depression => sadness, lack of joy, wanting to give up
    Coldness => along Large Intestine and Hormone System meridian on the arms
    Painful spots in the mouth => went away
    Fluid filled blisters on the gums where tooth was removed => started
    bleeding the next day
    Toothache => tooth with root canal and porcelain bridge attached, next to
    the blisters
    Cold sensitivity of teeth when drinking fluids => started after root canal
    Runny nose
    Stabbing earache => sore skin inside ears + itchy feeling left
    Slight stinging sensation in the urethra

    Measurement:
    Large Intestine => Brucella Abortus Bang, Diverticulosis, Bact Lactis
    Stomach (jaw) => Kieferostitis, Myristica Sebifera
    Lung => Staphylococcen, Staph. Aureus, Strep. Viridans

    >12 Years Program:
    Brucella Abortus Bang, Diverticulosis, Bact Lactis, Kieferostitis,
    Myristica Sebifera, Staphylococcen, Staph. Aureus, Strep. Viridans

    2nd Measurement:
    Lungs => Strep. Haemolyticus

    Footplate Treatment:
    Strep. Haemolyticus, Bact. Coli, Bact. Pyo, Bact. Proteus, Chelidonium,
    Granuloma Denti, Nux Vomica, Mercuriusheel

    Questions (questions above haven't been answered yet, so I continue to
    count):
    6. Do you have an explanation for the fluid-filled blister?
    7. Can it be a reaction using of Myristica Sebifera. Maybe something is
    coming out?
    8. Since the Jaw (Stomach) was part of my focus, did I make the right
    decision using Granuloma Denti on the footplates? I am a bit uncertain. I
    don't want to overburden the body with too many nosodes, but you did tell
    me to use all three dental remedies.
    9. During surgery 3 months ago I got a root canal in one tooth and a
    ceramic bridge. The teeth adjacent to the root canal are still hot and cold
    sensitive. Is it possible that they cause a disturbance and hold my results
    back?

    Follow up on oxalate limiting diet:
    Stopped completely with berries, spinach, coffee, tea, and chocolate for 2
    weeks... All the things I crave and like the most... I googled it and I
    don't eat anything else with high oxalate content. I have only drunk water
    with lemon. 
   
    Results:
    Symptoms changed for the worse
    More pain, but it has moved to the inside on the vagina
    Stabbing, burning pain, especially when urinating => same feeling as a mild
    urinary tract infection 
    The pain comes and goes.
    My boyfriend experiences the same burning, itching feeling
    The Bacterial Flora nosodes I used last treatment didn't improve these
    symptoms
     
    Question:
    Does this indicate anything, and should I continue to stop eating these
    things? (Its very sad to not be abel to eat these things in the summer
    time)

    Hi Liselotte,

    The comments on your latest treatment and questions will follow, but since
    you experience acute problems just by limiting your oxalate intake I will
    try to answer that urgent question first.

    Whenever your body has an overload of oxalates and cannot excrete it
    properly they are dumped into the tissues, causing all kind of harm. The
    moment you lower the intake, your body will start to excrete them. This
    maybe too much for your Kidneys to handle considering the aggravation of
    symptoms. BUT... the fact that this happened shows that you have found a
    cause of part of your problems. If you did not have any problems with
    oxalates, nothing would have changed.... 
    (on a side note: you also did get a Chiren treatment, but since there are
    no unusual remedies that you used and since you have treated yourself so
    many times, I think it is indeed the oxalate detox that cause the urinary
    tract symptoms)

    So now it is important to find a way to make this process easier on your
    body. Maybe just lowering the oxalate intake and not stopping it all
    together would be better as it will cause a milder detoxification process.
    But what also may help is treating with ALL Kidney support remedies and
    nosodes, especially Calculi Renales is important as it is made from kidney
    stones containing oxalates.

    Thank you so much for answering my acute problem, I am very grateful. 
    I will start just lowering the oxalate intake. 
    Right now I can handle the extra pain of the detoxification process.
    The gums are not sore now, but all other symptoms are still there. 

    Current Symptoms:
    Much more energy => still hard to feel joy though
    Constipation gone => one bowel movement a day
    Nausea and lack of appetite in the morning gone => now hungry and able to
    eat a lot for breakfast
    Freezing at bedtime => sleeping with 2 winter duvets and warm clothes on
    all year round
    Cold arms when going to sleep (11pm-1am) => first located on Large
    Intestine (improved a lot) and Hormone System meridian (now gone), but now
    is mainly located on the Small Intestine meridian
    Sleeplessness because of cold arms sometimes => but much improved
    Waking up between 5 and 7am => I normally sleep until 9am
    Coughing
    Runny nose
    Itchy ears
    Tingling sensation => face, possibly Stomach meridian
    Light sensitivity => pressure in/behind eyes when being out in the sun even
    with sunglasses => improved and at the end of this week I could go out
    wearing my sunglasses and a head without symptoms
    Sweaty hand palms => this varies, and sometimes they are completely dry
    Sore tongue
    Pain in gums replaced by itching
    Cold/heat sensitive teeth => dentist told me I was brushing too hard, and I
    follow her advise to use mouthwash and to not brush those 2 teeth for a
    while.

    Questions
    * If I treat will all nosodes and supports for the kidneys, then I cant
    treat the things that is dropping? 
    * The Measurement Protocol also lists different bacteria under the Kidneys
    should I use these too?
    * Do I then ignore all other measurements apart from the Kidneys?

    My suggestion was just meant as a way to deal with the acute problems with
    elimination. 100% focus sometimes makes a big difference. The next session
    you can continue treatment with a broader focus and also work on the other
    systems you mentioned.

    With Kidney nosodes I meant only the specific nosodes for Kidneys, not all
    possible infections like Intestinal Flora.

    So I would treat with:
    Cystopyelonephritis, Calculi Renales, Populus, Solidago, Berberis, Reneel,
    Albumoheel, and Atropinum (because of the relaxing effect on urinary ducts,
    which helps if there are actual Kidney stones)

    Of course you do need to measure the Kidneys before and after putting these
    remedies in the slots. If there are still drops then you can swop one
    remedy for the nosode that is needed to correct these drops. In this case I
    would choose not to use Albumoheel, since there is no protein in the urine.

    Answers to your June 25th questions:

    Question 1. During the first treatment I chose to focus on Hormone System,
    Lymphatic System and Stomach, when I then measured, the Large Intestine
    dropped and Appendicitis matched. I felt that I had to treat Appendicitis
    and Tonsillitis together.
    Did I focus enough? I thought that focus should be on a maximum of 3 Organ
    Systems, but I did treat the Large Intestine, because I don't want the
    Appendix to go back to the chronic condition again and this comes before
    the Stomach in the protocol. Was it OK to do this?

    Answer 1. Instead of Kieferostitis, you could indeed try to measure
    bacteria. 
    Whenever a Tonsil point drops and you measure Tonsillitis, you could also
    try to measure the bacteria.
    Your focus on the systems was good, but for example on the Paratyroid I
    would not have tried the Varicellen nosode because this has been tried and
    treated before.
    If it still matches, then there is something wrong with the body's
    self-healing system and this is most likely caused by a lack of proper
    excretion.
    The fact that the point is still dropping can be caused by a lack of (the
    right) responsiveness of the body, OR it means that the remedies used in
    the past (e.g. Varicellen) were not the right remedies and that something
    different is needed.


    Question 2. My hands and feet were sweaty on and off this week. When I
    started to measure myself my hands were dry, but during the process they
    became a bit sweaty again (dried them when needed to get better
    measurements. Does this indicate anything? 

    Answer 2. The fact that the Jaw point is still dropping after your dental
    work, means that there is still an infection in your jaw.
    If your sweaty hands came back suddenly during the measurement might
    indicate that there might be a stress factor triggering this. The stress
    could be mental, emotional or physical. This stress factor could also be an
    "expectation"


    Question 3. I remember getting sweaty hands after treatment a while back
    ago and you said that this was a good reaction as it shows the body is
    cleansing. So I am a bit confused now, does the sweating mean that
    something is wrong or is it a good response?

    Answer 3. Symptoms can occur when the body gets into stress or when it gets
    out of stress.
    If the symptom occurs after a treatment, it might mean that the body is
    releasing stress. But the opposite can be true as well. I am sorry but
    there are just too many possibilities...


    Question 4. You wrote: "You should try to find out what causes the
    inflammation. You can for example try to find the bacteria that might be
    responsible for infections. It could be Food Poisoning or a Strep/Staph
    bacteria."
    Does this mean I should measure for bacteria on all the dropping points
    instead of inflammation nosodes? If I measure drops on the Lymphatic
    System, should I try bacteria first instead of Tonsillitis? Or did you mean
    only on the Stomach points?

    Answer 4. You can use this approach for any infection that does not clear
    up after several treatments with the "inflammation nosode".

    Answers to your July 1st questions:

    Question 6. Do you have an explanation for the fluid-filled blister?

    Answer 6. Blisters are normally caused by too much friction on the area. It
    means that you brush too hard or with too hard a brush, thereby irritating
    the gums. Too little rest is given to the body in order to heal.

    Question 7. Can it be a reaction using of Myristica Sebifera. Maybe
    something is coming out?

    Answer 7. Myristica Sebifera is a remedy that helps with abscesses,
    blisters are not in that category and it is also very unlikely that
    blisters are caused as a response to this remedy. If the blisters are
    filled with pus, then it could be an expression of the abscess, but you did
    not mention this when you described your symptoms.

    Question 8. Since the Jaw (Stomach) was part of my focus, did I make the
    right decision using Granuloma Denti on the footplates? I am a bit
    uncertain. I don't want to overburden the body with too many nosodes, but
    you did tell me to use all three dental remedies.

    Answer 8. Using Granuloma Denti along with Kieferostitis will not add much
    of an extra burden to the body, since it's action is focussed on the same
    problem area (the teeth/jaw). In this case you could consider Granuloma
    Denti to be more of a "supportive nosode". You also did not exceed the
    limit of 8 nosodes in total, so your approach was fine.

    Question 9. During surgery 3 months ago I got a root canal in one tooth and
    a ceramic bridge. The teeth adjacent to the root canal are still hot and
    cold sensitive. Is it possible that they cause a disturbance and hold my
    results back?

    Answer 9. Absolutely, root canals are almost always a problem. And a
    ceramic bridge needs to be attached to metal. Metal in the mouth is also
    not good.

    More about the sensitive teeth:
    Tooth sensitivity is a symptom of a problem with the roots. But it might
    also be caused by the gums that influence the roots.
    The incredibly pain you experienced might be a jaw pain. This often feels
    like a problem in the ears but often is a problem in the jaw. But also the
    lymphatic vessels in the head are all connected which means that a jaw
    problem can easily travel to the lymphatic vessels of the ears...

    It is not about where you put the nosodes, it is how many you use in total
    (max. 8). 
    But nosodes are most likely to be used in the hand treatment because these
    are the remedies you measure to correct drops. Usually the systems of your
    focus will be corrected during the first hand treatment and no more nosodes
    will be used on the Footplates. 

    In this example Granuloma Denti is used in a supportive way and was not
    measured. The Jaw point was already corrected with Kieferostitis during the
    hand treatment. Granuloma Denti is still counted as a nosode, but during
    the whole session there were no more than 8 nosodes used (I do not count
    the Intestinal Flora unless they were measured to be an infection)

    I measured all points first. 

    Measurement (dried hand with towel):
    Kidney (Stone Point) => Calculi Renales
    Stomach (Jaw) => Leptospirose Canicola

    >12 Years Program:
    Cystopyelonephritis, Leptospirose Canicola, Populus, Solidago, Berberis,
    Reneel, Albumoheel, and Atropinum

    I used all the remedies you listed above, but somehow I switched Calculi
    Renales with Leptospirose Canicola. I was not planning to use the Stomach
    remedie, I just wanted to get a complete picture by measuring.... 

    2nd Measurement: 
    Kidney stone point dropping still. 

    I will use Calculi Renales in the Footplate Treatment. 

    Questions:
    1. Karolina:  Did you mean to only treat Kidneys this time, ignore the
    other drops, and treat normal next week? 
    2. What am I supposed to have on the footplates? More support?

    1. My idea was to focus completely on the Kidneys this time, and according
    to your measurements that is fine.. There are not that many other drops
    anyway.

    2. More remedies means more information that can send the healing energy of
    the body into more directions. This means less focus. So I would leave it
    with those remedies, and maybe only put Selenium and Neuralgo Rheum on the
    Footplates because they are both supportive to the Kidneys. And of course
    you still need to use Calculi Renales on the Footplates too, since this is
    the main nosode to use because of the oxalate...

    Anwers where very helpful. 

    My dentist also told me that the cold sensitivity could be caused by
    brushing too hard. She advised me to brush lighter, and not brush the 2
    affected teeth for some time. I followed her advice and did not have any
    pain or cold sensitivity for 24 hours now.

    Johan's comment: "Absolutely, root canals are almost always a problem. And
    a ceramic bridge needs to be attached to metal. Metal in the mouth is also
    not good."

    This is very bad news, because I got my root canal done now when I was
    correcting my mouth. The dentist did not ask me,she just did it.  
    But, my dentist told me there is no metal in my mouth. Not in the root
    filling and also not in the bridge. The bridge is cementen to my old teeth,
    one of them has a root canal.

    Questions
    A. Are root canals still bad if there is no metal used?
    B. What kind of symptoms can I get from root canals?
    C. Is there a good solution?
    D. Will further Chiren treatments be pointless if I still have a root canal
    filling?

    Session => Symptoms/Measurements in my posts of July 6th and 7th

    >12 Years Treatment:
    Albumoheel, Selenium, Reneel, Cystopyelonephritis, Leptospirose Canicola,
    Berberis, Atropinum, Solidago Populus.

    Footplate Treatment:
    Calculi Renalis, Calculi Bil, Neuralgo Rheum, Lymphomyosot, Hepar,
    Engystol, Cantaris

    Reaction (24 hours after treatment)
    Severe sleepiness => all the time
    Pressure moving around between sinuses, gums, and ears
    Sweaty handpalms => symptom improved, but not gone
    Runny nose => almost gone

    Questions 
    E. I added the Carculi Bil because I messured Carculi Renales. In class I
    have learned to also treat with Calculi Bil when Calculi Renales is
    measured. Is this also true for this situation?
    F. I gave the Footplate treatment before I received your answer, Karolina.
    Did you mean only to use 3 remedies on the Footplates?  
    G. I thought that whenever there is space one can fill it with extra
    support remedies, and that only the nosodes needed to be focused. Will too
    many support remedies also cause the healing energy to be spread out in too
    many directions. 
    H. Would it be good to focus on the Kidneys again in 7 days the way you
    suggested? Without extra remedies like Leptospirose Canicola, Calculi Bil
    and Supports that are not just for the Kidneys?

    Current Symptoms:
    Cold sensitive teeth => comes and goes
    Clenching => just realised I do this => may cause cold sensitivity
    according to dentist
    Pressure in gums
    Sore tongue and tonsils
    Itchy ears
    Runny nose
    Some acid reflux and bloating => more after treatment
    Headache (Gallbladder) => 4th day after treatment for some hours
    Slight pressure on top of the head (Bladder) => first days after treatment
    Hand palms much dryer first 3 days after treatment => 4th day started
    sweating a lot again
    Stinging pain in urethra => mostly moved to the outside skin area now

    Observations:
    When I drink more, my hand palms sweat less

    Current Practices:
    Brushing lighter
    Fluoride mouthwash => recommended by dentist for the cold sensitivity

    Session

    Measurement (after drying hands off):
    Kidneys => Calculi Renales, Bacterium Proteus
    Stomach - Jaw point => Brucellosis

    >12 Years Program:
    Calculi Renales, Bacterium Proteus, Bacterium Lactis, Bacterium Pyo,
    Bacterium Coli, Brucellosis, Calculi Billiaris, Solidago

    2nd Measurement (hands less sweaty now):
    No drops

    Footplate Treatment:
    Selenium, Berberis, Neuralgo Rheum, Atropinum, Reneel, Populus,
    Chelidonium, Nux Vomica

    Questions
    1. I remeasured many times, but did not find Gallbladder drops. Do you
    think that there should be a Gallbladder point dropping?
    2. My palms became less sweaty the first 3 days after treatment, but then
    started to sweat a lot again the 4th days and after. I needed to dry my
    hands frequently. Does that indicate something?
    3. Is there something else I must do in further treatments to resolve the
    sweaty hands?
    4. Any further recommendations?

    A. Root canals are always bad. I have been told by several dentists that
    they are the cause of continuous infections.
    B. The list of possible symptoms is almost limitless. The location (below
    which tooth) is a major determining factor as to where symptoms may show
    up. For this you can use the dental maps in your manual
    C. There is no good solution that I know of
    D. This can only be observed by continuing the Chiren treatments. Biophoton
    therapy may affect the symptoms, and maybe even the infections, but it is
    not very likely that this will work since the teeth have a very limited
    ability to drain

    Answers (July 9)
    E Whenever you treat with Calculi Bil, it is helpful to also put in Calculi
    Renales or the other way around.
    These nosodes are also good to treat for any calcification and Calculi
    Renales might be helpful in treating for oxalate sensitivity.
    F There is no need to fill up all the slots. If I would feel the need to
    fill up the slots, I would in your case choose
    a number of Circulation remedies. 
    G Using too many support remedies also tempts the body to go into too many
    directions
    H You should focus on the Kidneys as long as necessary

    Answers (July 13)
    1. There are reasons to suspect there is indeed a Gallbladder/Liver issue. 
    Tooth grinding is caused by muscles spasms, which is a Gallbladder problem,
    which could be caused by the Liver. And getting Gallbladder headaches, of
    course, is also a sign. 
    2. & 3. The sweating of the hand palms seems to disappear immediately after
    a treatment and then returns after about 72 hours. This is exactly the
    timespan that normally the biophoton treatment keeps working. During these
    72 hours the body experiences the relaxing effect of the session. When it
    is this relaxing effect that relieves the symptoms, this is indicative of
    Gallbladder and Circulation issues.

    Current Symptoms (5 days after treatment):
    Cold sensitivity moving from the root canal to the adjacent tooth
    Swollen tonsils => very sore
    Runny nose
    Itchy ears
    Painful vagina (outside), especially when walking and wearing tight clothes
     => increased after reducing oxalate
    Palms are almost dry after last treatment
    No more headache (Gallbladder meridian)

    Questions:
    1. What would you advise to do with my teeth? Should I remove the root
    canal?
    2. You wrote to treat the Kidneys "as long as necessary". How do I know
    when to stop?
    3. I do not grind my teeth, but clench them sometimes, possibly because of
    worrying about my health. Is this still related to the Gallbladder/Liver?

    I found out that the tooth of the root canal is connected to the following
    organs:
    Pineal gland
    Nose
    Sinuses (frontal and sphenoidal)
    Kidney (right)
    Bladder (right side)

    I went camping and noticed some changes:
    I was warm the whole camping trip, but when I returned home I got cold arms
    again.

    I always turn my Wifi off at night, but now I also unplug it. It seemed to
    help somewhat as I was warm when sleeping and the day after I did this.

    Measurement:
    Parathyroid => Brucellosis
    Lymphatic System - Tonsils, Ears => Brucellosis
    Veins (L) - all points => Aurumheel

    >12 Standard Program:
    Brucellosis, Aurumheel, Barijodeel, Aesculus, Atropine, Circulo, Placenta

    2nd Measurement:
    No drops

    Footplate Treatment:
    Tonsilla Compositum, Chelidonium, Anginheel, Selenium, Solidago,
    Lymphomyosot, Populus, Mercuriusheel


    A dentist told me that it was possible to take out the tooth of the root
    canal and then use the tooth next to it to attach a porcelain bridge (no
    metal used). They grind down the teeth and then attach porcelain bridge
    over the old teeth.

    Question:
    4. Would it be ok to have a bridge cemented to two of my teeth after the
    root canal is removed?

    Answers:
    2. "as long as necessary" means as long as the related symptoms are still
    there or only resolved temporarily, and/or as long as the Kidney points
    drop. But since your measurements are not really reliable, possibly because
    your skin is so wet, you will have to go by symptoms.
    3. Clenching is an expression of tension too, and all tension is related to
    the Gallbladder/Liver system. So this would still be an indication that
    there is something out of balance there.

    The other questions about how to proceed with your teeth I will leave to
    Johan.

Intestinal Flora

Satya OrionSatya Orion
April 2015 edited April 2015 in Q&A Flag
The Large Intestine keeps asking for Intestinal Flora on multiple sessions (the
only remedy that it wants).
The Flora have been cleared from all other meridians.

Questions:
1. Does this mean that there is still some underlying problem with the Large
Intestine?
2. If so, where should I look for possible causes?
3. Is Appendicitis/Tonsillitis the only reason for the Intestinal Flora to
leave the Large Intestine?

    What type of anemia? And what is the whole condition of the person you're

    I have been treating this man for a very long time... Mostly because on my
    lack of knowledge with Biophotons. 

    Symptoms: Pain in the descending colon area, Tremor especially at night
    that would wake him from sleep. 
     
    Doctors diagnosis: His doctor discovered he was anemic and started giving
    him iron, which has eliminated the tremors, but we were wondering about
    cause....

    Previous treatments: He had many many drops at first. 
    I treated him for a very long time for Appendix and Tonsils. They had
    cleared and then he got very sick with the flu, so I am treating those
    again. 

    Recent measurement: 
    Triple Warmer, 
    Intestines 
    Circulation 
    Bladder, 
    Stomach, 
    Liver 
   
    He is a push through the pain and sickness kind of guy, but his Gall
    Bladder has not shown, so I put several Gall Bladder remedies in this last
    time and then he had some drops on his Gall Bladder. I took out and added
    Gall Bladder remedies until his gall bladder cleared using some of the
    information we have gotten in class. 
   
    My question is what I can support him with to help with the anemia?

    Hi Sharon,

    I would ask you to be even more specific when you present a case, there are
    some instructions "how to use the Forum" to ensure clarity and acuracy in
    our discussions.
    Take a look :
    http://www.biontology.com/vanilla/index.php?p=/discussion/21/
    how-to-use-the-forum#Item_5
   
    There is surely "something" you can support him with to heal his condition
    and anemia. But as Karolina wrote, with our work as detectives to search
    for the cause, we cannot give out general recepies but guidelines for you
    to know where to look for a cause not a symptom.
     
   
    Anemia is a name on conditions where the blod has reduced capacity to
    transport O2 in the blood. THere are more types.  You can have Anemie for
    several reasons, one is because of problems with the Intestines, Ulcurs and
    other illnesses in Stomach and Intestines. 
   
    Find a Nosode that match his drops on the intenstines and Stomach.
    (Appendisitis still match? Ulcurs Duenotitis, Ulcurs Ventriculi,
    Duenoditis, test Diverticulose, Podyphyllum, Carc. Coli for his pain in the
    Large intestine decending area if App does not match for a start. 
   
    Then see if the chosen Nosode corrects the other drops on his Circulation.
    Bladder and Liver. 
   
    Gallbladder : Suppression is most certainly a topic as you describe him and
    your last treatment. Liver and Gallbladder belong to same Element in
    5-element teaching (wood) and you do have a drop on his Liver measurements.
    Zirrhose Hepatis, Galium, Biliary Cirrhose, Atropinum for a startpoint. But
    all these drops might clear with the right nosode for intestine and stomach
    but sometimes there is more trouble created over time and you will need a
    Liver /Gall nosode to correct all drops.
   
    Good luck

    Hi Sharon, 
    Yes I can see them, the charts with the drops.

    Did Chronic Appendicitis and Chroninc Tonsillitis correct the drops of the
    first measurements (red?) 
    Did the drops on Triple Warmer dissapear at the same time?
   
    You measured stones, they do not dissapear in one session if they are
    manifested in the body so measure them again next session. 
   
    I advice you to correct the drops on Hormonal system and Circulation first
    and then Large Small intestine, if Appendicitis and Tonsillitis matches on
    all the drops it is wise to treat. 

    Keep measuring and give advice. the Anemia will correct itself when the
    body is back in balance and you go with the symptoms and the drops you
    hear. You had a drop on the LIver meridian, did it correct with
    Appendicitis or stones?

    After treatment he had a lot more bowel movements than normal. They were

    Here are the drops he had this week shown in red.

    I treated with these remedies:

    Appendicitis - cleared Appendix
    Chronic Tonsillitis - cleared Tonsils
    Ulcus Duodeni -cleared Large Intestines and Nerves
    Biliary Cirrhosis - cleared Gall Bladder 
    Penicillinum - cleared Bladder

    When I remeasured, there were no more drops, so I put these remedies in the
    footplates for him and ran:
    Dyslexia program with:
    5 Bact.
    Aesculus
    Plantago
    Veratrum
    Remeasuring found no more drops.

    I see that you use 5 Bacteria. There are only 4 good Intestinal Bacteria in
    the Chiren.

    That the Ulcus Duodeni cleared the Nervous System is very unlikely.

    I see that previously the Bladder(?) matched Cystopyelonephritis. The last
    time Penicillin matched.
    These two matchings seem contradictory. If Cystopyelonephritis matches,
    there is an inflammation of the urinary tract. If Penicillin matches, there
    should be Penicillin in the bladder. Penicillin that is in the Chiren is
    the opposite of the anti-biotic (so it will match when there's a suppressed
    inflammation/infection).
    I would look for other bacteria matching the Bladder.

    Why use Veratrum? Veratrum is not a remedy for Ulcers. If it was intended
    for the Ulcers, then Erigotheel is a better support.

    As far as anemia is concerned: This is mostly a Liver issue, but could also
    be caused by the Ulcers (non-absorption).

Dyscalculi (Math Disability)

Beate
February 2013 edited February 2014 in Symptoms Flag

I have followed protocol for years with this person, woman 60 years. She also
was diagnosed with Dyslexia, which is not a prominent problem any more.

She has no big  health problems, except for the Dyscalculi.

She get biophoton treatment for wellbeeing  on a regular basis.

There is more or less always a need for Cerebrum, Viscum and Thalamus on the
footplates. If anybody has experience or thoughts around Dyscalculi it will be
appreciated.

Dyscalculia (also called math disability or numlexia) is a specific learning
disability involving innate difficulty in learning or comprehending arithmetic.
It is akin to dyslexia and includes difficulty in understanding numbers,
learning how to manipulate numbers, learning maths facts, and a number of other
related symptoms. Math disabilities can also occur as the result of some types
of brain injury, in which case the proper term is acalculia, to distinguish it
from dyscalculia which is of innate, genetic or developmental origin.

Although math learning difficulties do occur in children with low IQs,
dyscalculia also affects people from across the whole IQ range, and sufferers
often, but not always, also have difficulties with time, measurement, and
spatial reasoning.  Estimates of the prevalence of dyscalculia range between 3
and 6% of the population. Dyscalculia does not necessarily imply higher
mathematical reasoning difficulties as well as difficulties with arithmetic
operations; in fact, evidence exists (especially from brain damaged patients)
that arithmetic (e.g. calculation and number fact memory) and mathematical
(abstract reasoning with numbers) abilities can be dissociated. That is (some
researchers argue), an individual might suffer arithmetic difficulties (or
dyscalculia), with no impairment of, or even giftedness in, abstract
mathematical reasoning abilities.

    Wow Beate, thank you for clarifying what that is.  
   
    I believe I have that "acalucla' as a result of meningoencephalitis that I
    had (from the Echo) virus in India.  I developed brain adhesions which
    severely affected me for years, stuttering, (which my boys thought was real
    funny) and a number of other problems.  And I did develop a lot of
    difficulty with math and spacial problems, yet other things like
    memorization and almost a photgraphic memory became better.  
   
    Almost  all the symptoms subsided (some of the good ones remained) except
    the math and spacial problems. Now I have a term for it and an
    understanding of it.
   
    Thank you!

    At last I know what is wrong with me!! Thank you so much for this
    information. 

    I have never been able to do math (which was very embarrassing when I was
    put into the 'dumbell' class in high school - and never did algebra or
    geometry). I also have a depth perception weakness (which I assume is
    'spatial'), which affects me when I drive (although I have learned to
    compensate for this). 

    These math problems make it difficult to do any kind of work with numbers,
    i.e. measuring for recipes, working with devices that use numbers,
    understanding how to work with a fraction! 

    So, question is: Should I run myself with Dyslexia, and which remedies
    should I test to help my brain and lack of confidence regarding anything
    with numbers? 

    Thank you so much for this!

    at the Pentagon when I was 9 months old...doing that gives a child under 2
    years of age the diseases. 

    I have always wondered if this caused that part of my brain to not function
    properly, because I know there are 'blank' spots in there!

    Hello friends, yes this is a severe condition....which is mixed up with all
    the different types of dyslexias.

    Other promenent signs of dyscalculi are:

    Understand a bus, or train sceduale  . The numbers get all mixed up,
    absolute no meaning in the whole thing.The numbers are not connected at
    all.
    Learn the notes to play an instrument according to the book. Understand
    (get information that makes sense).
    Knitting a pattern from reading,  get mixed up, as well as numbers in an
    account.

     Appointments are a disaster, and people with dyscalculi arrive always too
    early...... ( you do not read the right time, or you read it but do not
    process in a common way).
    So this is a terrrible state of mind and create a kind of "spin" in the
    system. Like a downward spirale, actually.

    Operating computers and sort things out in numbers and activtis is
    additional stress.

    The shame of not being able to voice oneself is tremendous, because people
    would think you are stupid if you tell the truth about this condition. It
    is not stupidity but areas that are disconected for some reason I believe.
    It is for sure inhrieted, since I see the same pattern in the same family.

    I am happy to hear from all of you, thanks!

    I suggest you also use:

    1) Tuberculinum and Tuberculinum Bovinum 

    2) Medorrhinum  

    3) Intestinal Flora.

    All three have this as one of the symptoms

    Dyscalculi

    Johan, I have done exactly what you suggested, two treatments. The result
    is interesting. The first thing to be noticed was that sorting things in
    the refrigerator became easy. (Before a mess and stress).
    The items became easy to place, and it felt structured for this person. The
    feeling of calmness and order, a tremendous relief.  I will continue the
    treatments. Thank you.

    Dyscalculi

    Being a quadruple Virgo with Uranus in Gemin makes me VERY organized and
    detailed (ad nauseum, as you all know!), and I can do my bank book and a
    $500,000 annual budget when I had my magazine without a problem. I just
    can't do math "problems" - where you have to think about the numbers. I
    love details and love to organize - these are not a problem at all for
    me. But yes, Beat: bus schedules, maps, appointment books (perfectly
    organized, but look very messy) are all difficult. And one of the problems
    is "feeling so stupid" ... which stops the brain from functioning, too!
    Thank you Johan for those tips. I will do it tonight! Do you think there is
    a Bach or Bush remedy for this feeling of being so stupid in this way that
    one could add to the mix? Thank you.

    change...as the refrigerator experience. The way to freedom. The green

Pituitary Dropping - No Matching Nosodes

Jiri
July 2014 edited July 2014 in General Questions Flag
Client:
59 year old female, who has received over 20 Biontology sessions

Symptoms:
Difficulty sleeping
Stomach discomfort
Cramps in calves and feet
Excessive stress => related to undergoing divorce and inability to find
full-time work as an accountant.
High cholesterol (223). 

History:
Auto accident in 1990 requiring 7 facial surgeries => multiple scars (over her
head from ear to ear; below both eyes; on the sides of her nose)

General Treatment Information:

Scar Treatment: all four indicated external scars + internal scars bilaterally
under her eyes => resulted in recovered feeling in her face below the eyes

3 Whiplash Treatments, since beginning treatments 

The most recent session I also needed to give a Spin Inversion Treatment.

For the last 6 sessions, most or all the drops have been corrected
concentrating on the Gastro-Intestinal tract and Circulation.

For the last 3 treatments, I've been unable to find a matching nosode for the
Pituitary. 


Remedies tested, when trying to correct the Pituitary (none of these matched):

Poliomyelitis 
Variolinum 
Varicellen 
Appendicitis 
Tonsillitis 
Chronic Tonsillitis 
All food poisonings 
All airborne toxins 
Anti-tetanus 
Luesinum 
Rest of vaccinations
Ovarial cyst 
Myom Uteri 
Viscum 
Selenium 
Hormeel 

Remedies that corrected the Pituitary in past sessions:
Serum Ovile
Poliomyelitis
Anti-Tetanus
Diptherie
Tonsillitis
Chronic Tonsillis
Salmonella Parathyphi
Varicellen
Ulcus Ventriculi (corrected with drops on the stomach meridian)
Barijodeel (corrected with drops on the circulation meridan)

Questions:
1. Could there be a relationship with her scars and the inability of finding a
nosode to correct the drop on the pituitary? (even though I've been able to
correct drops in the past)

2. What other nosodes could I try?

3. What else could be causing the continued drop on the pituitary?

    I often have this issue myself, but today i noticed that Formeldehyde fixed
    the drop.

    Jiri: Formaldehyde is definitely something that can make the Pituitary
    drop. But I think you already tried that considering your comment of having
    tried "all airborne toxins"

    The drops could also be caused by the irritation of the point itself. When
    you measure often, the skin gets irritated.

    It could also be that the scars might still be blocking and need multiple
    treatments.

    The other things you could try are Schwefheel or Psorinum.

    Johan: Thanks for the information. Yes, I had tried Formaldehyde. And, yes,
    I knew that I was irritating the point with all the testing to find a
    matching nosode.

    Considering your comments, I decided the following strategy for her
    treatment this week:

    1. After viewing the Pituitary meridian and finding it ending at the
    lateral aspect of each eye, I performed another scar treatment using rods
    place and the lateral aspect of the eye to the nose on each side of her
    face.

    2. After the first measurement, I found nosodes (Appendicitis Nec/Chronic
    Tonsillitis) that corrected most of the drops. I then tested it on the
    Pituitary and found it matched.

    This problem has provided more understanding of a successful biophoton
    treatment. I'm finally learning to look at the overall picture after the
    first measurement. I then use that information to prioritize the focus of
    the organ systems in my treatment plan. It's amazing how easy it is to
    correct drops on multiple organ systems using very few nosodes!

    Johan: I think I'm finally "getting it"!

    I may have mentioned Formaldehyde earlier, but that didn't ultimately work
    for me either. 

    Something was causing my Pituitary or Parathyroid to drop, and it was
    giving me an ever changing variety of red bumps and skin issues around my
    throat as well- probably virus and fungus. This coincided with C5 going out
    in my lower spine, causing tight hamstrings and other weakness. 

    I think I may have figured it out. Probably stress related to my house not
    selling! 
    It's my TMJ (=tightness in the jaw). This led to me sleeping with my mouth
    wide open (not attractive!) and sleep apnea. This constant exposure allowed
    all sorts of things to enter my mouth and my body's immunity to did not
    have the strength to fight it off. An osteopath helped with the TMJ and
    neck realignment. I now have no more drops and my back is once again in
    alignment as well. 
    I also have a conditional offer on my house!

    Interesting!

    An energetic/Biontology approach:
    Fear of not selling the house => Weakening of Water element = Kidneys/
    Bladder
    The Bladder meridian runs along the spine and herniated discs are caused by
    its weakening
    Red skin bumps can be caused by weakened Kidneys not able to expel all
    toxins…

    Tightness in muscles and clenching is related to the Gallbladder system
    (Wood) overreacting because of being under stress as a result of the
    weakened Water element. 

    These are the systems, I believe, need focus when treating the underlying
    energetic problem, but of course selling the house is the major solution ;
    -). 

    Osteopaths are great in helping to solve structural problems, and this can
    be a great addition to Biontology since it does not add anything to the
    body (energetically or chemically). Working alongside with a good holistic
    dentist is also a good recommendation to help more people. But of course
    only when the informational/energetic approach is not enough. 

    Good luck with selling your house!

    Thank you Karolina. I have kept an eye on all of the other systems at the
    same time and just give myself support occasionally. I am going to keep a
    look out for the kidneys especially, however. My osteopathic treatment
    seemed to help for a while, but it's back - but then the financing on my
    house sale is still unresolved too. It will be interesting to see if the
    sale and my issues resolve together. I will need a good strong back for
    moving!

Bee Stings and Vision Problems

Chrystyne
March 2013 edited February 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
CASE STUDY:  The Case of the Beekeeper
Today’s date: 16 March 2013
Presented by: Chrystyne Jackson

CLIENT:

  • Client is 80 years old
  • Vision 20/80 – vision was “thought” to be 20/80 3 months ago, but was not
    tested. Recent tests evaluate him at 20/80.
  • All points have been cleared over treatment period (see exception below).
  • Very positive about his treatment; his “goal” is to be able to see the
    wrinkles in my face.

EXCEPTION: 
Insulin point (right hand) indicates sugar drops every time measured. Actual
blood tests on sugar with a glucose meter show between 90 and 110 consistently.

TREATMENT: 
Occurrence is consistently once a week beginning 3 months ago. No noticeable
improvement in that timeframe. Protocol:

 1. Gallium, Lymphomyosot, Coenzyme, Ubichion, Oculoheel, Cerebrum, Placenta,
    Cactus Comp on Standard program (8-12)
 2. Veratrum, Glonion, Gelsenium, Psorinum, Belladonna on Standard program
    (8-12)

PROTOCOL DESCRIPTION for TREATMENT
Each time the client comes; each product (remedy) has been verified compatible
for his treatment.

CLIENT HISTORY
Client was a beekeeper who received thousands of bee stings including the
repeated venomous bites of a Queen while clipping her wings. Client was a
beekeeper for 35 years. The last contact with bees was 5 years ago.

His current honey consumption is 3 teaspoons daily.

CURRENT CONDITION
This client sees normally well in the mornings, but by noon, he describes his
vision as “fog”. He feels that it is allergies, but those points are fine when
measured.

Could these historic repeated bee-stings/bites be causing the measurement of
insulin to show through the Chiren point, but not in the glucose meter?

1 - Do you agree with the protocol I provided above?
2 - Do you suggest differently, if so, what specifically?

Thank you,
Chrystyne

    Hi Chrystyne

    I have a few question, I wounder about :)


    1. You treat with a lot of supports remedies, is it because you already
    have been there with the nosodes?
        Johan always says: we have to find the cause of the symptoms, and if
    the same points drops every time
        we haven't found the cause yet.

    2. why do you use standard 8-12 year, not standard >12 on glass rods and
    dyslexia on the footplates?

    according to protocol you can use Gallbladder remedies(nosode) on the
    insulin point, and according to the 5. element:  Liver/gallbladder can
    disturb stomach and therefore the eyes.


    Just some thoughts :)


    Looking forward to the answer form Karolina/Johan

    Margit

    Hi Chrystyne,

    Thank you for your first case-study. Like Margit I notice you probably
    didn't work according to the protocol of measurement and treatment that
    Johan send out to everyone. I would advice you to thoroughly read this.

    1. Nosodes are always the main remedies you should look for. They are the
    most potent in resolving causal issues. Support remedies are really only
    used to support, they don't solve the problems by themselves.

    2. I would like to know how you arrived at the idea to use two 8-12 year
    treatments instead of the >12 year program and the Footplate Treatment.
    This doesn't make sense at all and will reduce the effectiveness of the
    session. 
    Actually the 8-12 treatment is never used anymore! Even for children
    between 8 and 12 years old the 2-7 year program is used now. With
    discarding the Footplate treatment you are missing a very important part of
    the treatment, please don't do this.

    3. Using the same remedies every time in a recipe is not effective at all,
    especially if after one treatment you didn't see anything change. Why
    continue something that doesn't work?

    4. The thoughts of Margit about the Insulin point are very likely to be
    right.

    5. Regarding this specific case with all the bee-stings I would advise you
    to use Apis in addition to the nosodes that you measure, since this is a
    homeopathic remedy made from bee-venom. 

    I hope this will help you a bit, but again I advise you to really have a
    look again at the protocol. Reading posts on this forum will also help you
    to get more understanding on how to treat.

Spin Inversion - Difficulty

slevarekslevarek
January 2014 edited January 2014 in Spin Inversion & Cause Flag
Client:
60 year old woman. Is in a centre that came to me to see what we could find out
as she has been to the Mayo Clinic.

Symptoms:
Permanent Nausea (9 months) => Started out with Vertigo
Lost lots of weight, 
She can't take vitamins, can't eat.. 
Feels spaced out all the time.. 

Medication/Drugs:
Not on drugs..  all they gave her is Klonopin! 

Difficulty:
Doesn't respond to Spin Inversion Treatment, thus I'm unable to measure her.

1st Session:
Whiplash - 3 times
Spin Inversion Treatment - 8 times! (with blood) => only then was able to
measure. Treatment went ok.

2nd Session:
More difficult than the first! Could not get a reading whatsoever. 

I treated for Spin Inversion using a drop of blood, as well as trying the
saliva.. I had her drink lots of water.. etc.. Still nothing.. 

I measured myself => Not in Spin Inversion

There's no metal on her body.. However, her mouth is full of metal, mercury,
and root canals and crowns which I believe could very well be the cause of
this.. 

Question:
Any suggestions/advice?

    Why do you do Whiplash if you cant measure? I would try something for
    therapy resistance, or Selenium and Berberis to see if she responds.

    What did you measure the 1st session? You mention that you where able to
    measure…. there might be some clues there… And what exactly went ok? 

    When you can't resolve Spin Inversion there's an ongoing cause, and that
    may very well be the dental work. In this case it does not make any sense
    to treat until the Cause is gone.
    Never treat with remedies when someone is in Spin Inversion.
   
    But when you are able to get her at least out of Spin Inversion, but
    measurement remains a problem, I would suggest treatment with
    Kieferostitis, Granuloma Denti, and Mercury anyway, since you know that
    there are huge dental issues. Also add Stomach, Gallbladder and Kidney
    remedies. This might improve things if it is still possible and keep her
    out of Spin Inversion…

    Peter, I did Whiplash first when I note a drops on all points. Then if the
    points still all drop, I do the Spin inversion.

    Further information:

    1st Session => responsive to Spin Inversion treatment = points became
    measurable

    >12 Program:
    Hormone System - Anti-Tetanus, Poliomyelitis, Selenium (Adrenal)
    Large Intestine - Bact. Proteus, Bact. Pyo
    Pancreas - Lead
    Nervous - Aluminum
    Bladder - Cystopyelonephritis

    Foot Plates:
    Cerebrum, Viscum, Thalmus, Tonico, Atropium, Schwefheel, Calm & Clear

    Short program for AURA/WIFI:
    Electro Essence, Space Clear Essence, Causticum, Ozaliet, Crab Apple

    2nd Session: Just could not get her out of a Spin Inversion..

    I DID give her remedies even though I could not get her out of a Spin
    Inversion.

    >12 Program:
    Kieferostitis, Granuloma Denti, Mercury, Nux Vomica, Lymphosot, Belladona,
    Aesculus, Chronic Appendicitis

    Foot Plates:
    Tonsilitis, Mimilus (she has so much fear) Ozaliet, Fringed Violet,
    Cerebrum, Viscum, Thalmus - repeated this, as she has problems with her
    mind being clear, with remembering, etc.. her energy low..

    Results:
    I received a call last night.. the clinic was impressed at her change..
    which for me was a surprise since I felt I could have done better, but
    really was not so sure why I could not get her out of a Spin Inversion.

    Something must have worked, for the clinic to call me back with such
    positive results.. She has a team of 5 working with her at the clinic..
    They all have been so surprised by the change in her face, .. her energy. I
    realize that we have some work to do.. but a least they have stopped doing
    "detoxes" with her.. it was too hard on her body.. .

    Tooth assessment:
    I talk to my uncle about the metal in her mouth.. He told me the way to
    test which tooth is the one bothering the body the most:
    * Measure the 2nd point on Lymphatic System
    * When it drops the client put a finger to the root canal, or the tooth
    with crown or mercury filling
    * If the point stops dropping this is an indication this tooth is very
    toxic to her body..
    * You can treat with the standard remedies for jaw infection, but it will
    continue to infect her body unless they get it removed..

    I suggested this to the husband.. and just received an email from him. He
    found out that she has a root canal on the 20th tooth, which is connected
    to the Stomach/Spleen Meridian.
    Also she has Crowns the 4th and 14th tooth, which are connected to Stomach
    and Intestines..
    All the molars have Mercury fillings.

    Along with all the Mercury in her other teeth she is weakened by the
    infections.

    It is not surprising that she has nausea.. and all the tests that the MAYO
    clinic did, never did find anything wrong with her..They instead gave her
    Klonopin.

    I will let you know on the 3rd sessions what the results are.. Thanks for
    you replies

    The Pancreas and Nervous System should have been left alone the first
    treatment(s) when following protocol, and especially the Heavy Metals are
    not to be used until the Hormone System and Yang Organs (elimination!) are
    OK.
    Focus, and the right order of treatment are very important! 

    So what probably happened is that the body of your client was overwhelmed
    by being forced to detox, when it was not ready yet. It is not so strange
    that she then gets a huge energy problem. Her Adrenals were dropping to
    begin with...
    Lack of energy = lack of Aura => measures like, but is not necessarily Spin
    Inversion. 

    If she really was in Spin Inversion treating her would have likely given
    her an aggravation of her symptoms (so this is never a good idea), but she
    got an improvement which means that the Aura treatment and especially the
    Ozaliet helped her, and that it was indeed an energy/Aura problem you
    measured and not Spin Inversion.

    It all worked out, but it is important to understand what you are actually
    measuring and what happens in the treatment, and especially that it is
    better to follow the protocol next time and focus on the Organ Systems in
    the right order. You could have created severe reactions this way, even
    though this client was OK. 

    It helped that the Kidneys had no problem from the start, because treating
    Heavy Metals when the Kidneys are not good is not a good idea at all.

    Removing the root canal is very sensible advise. Root canals almost always

    Very enlightening the discovery of these affected teeth influencing the
    specific digestive meridians according to the dental correlation map! 
    But also remember that in general Jaw and Teeth problems are connected and
    measurable on the Stomach Meridian (1st proximal point) and that thus
    Dental/Jaw issues affect digestion always adversely.
   
    A pointer in choosing Remedies for the Footplate treatment => try to select
    Supports that reflect the Organ Systems that you treated with Nosodes, and
    the issues you found. 
    For example: You found a Bladder infection (Cystopyelonephritis matched…)
    So Cantharis might have been a good Support. And also you know there are
    inflammatory issues, which you might want to support with Belladonna or
    Chelidonium (contains Belladonna and supports the Gallbladder at the same
    time, which definitely has an issue taking the whole stress/digestive issue
    in account)…
   
    It is a misunderstanding (and waste of space because you could use more
    relevant=effective Supports) to use Viscum, Cerebrum and Thalamus every
    time on the Footplates. This combination of remedies (and without other
    remedies!) is used on the Footplates when you specifically treat Dyslexia.
   
    Try not to use an extra Program at the end, but use the 1 or 2 Flower
    Essences you selected on the Footplate treatment. 
    In general don't use more than 16 remedies including Flowers.

Beta-Blockers

George
April 2014 edited April 2014 in Medication Flag
I seem to remember beta-blockers make treatment much more difficult (or even
impossible?). 

Question:
Could you please explain what effect beta-blockers have on treatment?

Comments

  • 
    Renate
    April 2014 edited April 2014 Flag
    Anything with the name "blocker" will block the body from working
    properly.  Beta Blockers, Acid Blockers, etc.  The other common blocker: 
    Acid Blockers are also called Proton Pump "Inhibitors" (PPI's). 

    The Chiren lifts suppression which is the opposite of blockers/inhibitors. 
    The body needs clear instructions in one direction. 

    While blockers often block treatment, I have had good results with clients
    who slowly taper off their PPI's.  This must be done VERY slowly or they
    will have a rebound effect.   I always advise them to work with their
    doctor who prescribed the medication as giving medical advice is outside
    the scope of our practice.  This would be especially important for someone
    wanting to get off a Beta Blocker since the heart is involved. 

    The client needs to be aware that the sessions needed while tapering off
    the blocker will be additional since not much will take place until they
    are off the inhibiting/blocking medication.

    Great answer! Beta blockers indeed have the effect of "blocking", and thus 
    conflict with the regulation of the body just like cortison or other
    steroid do. The same rule of thumb that 3 times as many treatments are
    needed to get results applies here too.
   
    I think what you suggested is a great and safe way to proceed, both for
    yourself and for your client.

    Thanks very much for your answers.

    Do beta-blockers block treatment completely or will it just take 3 times as
    long? Assuming the client does not taper off their beta-blockers.

    I do believe tapering off is the better choice, this will make treating
    your client much easier. 

    However if he/she does not want to do this it still is possible to get
    results, but you have to expect for it to go really slowly.

Disturbed Living Space - Environmental Effects

umanyc
May 2013 edited January 2014 in Spin Inversion & Cause Flag

Client:
Lady, I have had two Sessions with... approached me for further treatment.

Symptoms:
Hum in Head (since March 2012, 6 months after baby was born). 
She blamed the house she lived in (2 minutes from Train Station), relocated but
now lives again next to a Train Station. She also found out that her new home
is near a Precision Laboratory Service Factory (repairs and machine calibration
of different extends).

Session
Did Whiplash, Scar Treatment (has quite a bit of them, also C-section)
and Spin-Inversion (several times) and used Ozaliet which got her Energy up in
the Readings.

Thinking process:
The Ozaliet makes sense where as if she has been affected so much during her
pregnancy, delivery was difficult turned into emergency c-section over
exhausted. Her body had never a true change to recoup

Current Situation:
Feels a bit better, but still hears and feels the Hum and Drum/Boom in her head
(less intensity). She mentioned today close before it started she had a Stye in
her Eye.

She just called me earlier today and told me she had one of the worse nights
ever, the mechanic factory was working all night and the sounds was everywhere,
also her daughter was not able to sleep at all. I feel very much for this
client as I know she is not in a position to move house as she feels everything
everywhere.

Question:
Knowing where she lives and she will not be able to move away for the next 2
years, what can I contribute that her sessions will have the most effect
without being affected as much by the area she lives in?

    I can't tell much about your treatments (other then that you shouldn't
    treat Whiplash, Scars or Spin-Inversion without measuring every point on
    both hands and feet first), since there's too little information given.... 
    But your client is definitely in a situation of Exhaustion getting worse
    and worse...  

    Birth of Child + C-section + Taking Care of a New Born for 6 months.... ==
    => Costs a lot of Energy ===> Low Energy ===> Low Immune Function ===> Stye
    in Eye + Inability to deal with Environmental Disturbances or other
    Stressors ===> Spin Inversion ===> Exhausted Adrenals ===> Humming Sound
    (different cause than Ringing Sound, which is due to Stress/Gallbladder)
   
    Exhausted Adrenals are never alone and will be accompanied by Gallbladder/
    Liver problems. So I would focus on these Systems (Adrenals/Gallbladder/
    Liver) mostly. 
    However it would make sense -if it is possible for her- to move out of her
    home for some weeks when she is treated by you. When she then has regained
    some basic strength she will be able to deal with her environment much
    better.... It is difficult to treat while she is continuously exposed to a
    disturbing field...
   
    Also in her condition most activities and daily chores will be too much to
    her system, so she should do as little as possible, let go and relax, also
    emotionally. Difficult with a young child though.... Maybe she can get some
    assistance.

    First of all thank you for setting my context in the correct form, I really
    had a hard time putting it all in writing and reading it now, it is so much
    more clear in this way.
    I will practice and get used to it! I love the forum!

    1st Session:
    Client had a heavy Spin Inversion ==> had to run the program several times
    Energy reading was quite low ==> after the scar/whiplash treatment her
    energy reading went up.

    Measurement: found the nosodes (vaccinations) to correct her drops.

    Current situation:
    No option to move out of the house (just signed a 2 year lease).
    Family and Laws live in different country.
    Partner works full time. 
    Daughter is still breast feeding...

    Off course because she is so tired this is for her not the time to change
    this, as she does not have the energy to deal with screaming child, she
    does not eat or drink water (only breast milk and here and there a little
    fruit).

    She is a very sweet little girl, crystal child
    On top of that, the girl sleeps in her room because there is not really a
    room for her.

    I feel too that her exposing home situation will not give a fair chance for
    treatment, as she will not be able to do so as you recommend.

    She is leaving for a month to Italy in July, to stay with her in laws,
    because she does not hear the noise in that area.
    In her home country she stayed for a little time, with her grandmother whom
    lives in the mountains, and the noise was even worse than in London and
    this is without any infrastructure! She could hear the power lines and all
    sort of vibrations.

    Other problem is also at times she told me on the phone she had 3/4
    suicidal moments (a month ago she wrote a goodbye letter to her daughter)
    and the other day when she had one of the worse days she cannot handle it
    anymore.

    She has had 2 treatments in person, hopefully she will come this week but
    i'm not sure.

    Should i offer long distance treatments for now? As i would feel bad having
    her pay and her time to come from far, where is in al fairness her
    surroundings/situation are not giving a real chance to heal. (but she does
    need help)

    Update:

    Client has not been able to come after last weeks session but is going to
    try to come next week

    Phone conversation last week:
    Client had one of the worst nights ever.
    Did a distance treatment for Energy/Aura only.

    I have been asking for confirmation of this by explaining the situation and
    after posting it, and feeling so moved with her pain, I guess I knew the
    answer, at least I can try to contribute while she is not able to come and
    see me in person.

    Current Feeling (spoke with her yesterday):
    Feels better and sounded a bit more upbeat.
    Still hears and feels vibration, but after the remote session it has not
    been as strong anymore.

    This week I will support her Energy/Aura from a distance and hopefully next
    week we can work in person again.

    Very promising that there's some improvement.

    In this case the Chikey with Aura/Energy Chipcard might be a good solution
    too for her to maintain her strength within this field of disturbance in
    her environment....

    Client:
    My 6 years old daughter.

    Medical diagnosis:
    FSGS (kidney disease)

    Past Medical Treatment:
    Heavy medication
    Immunosuppressants => stopped in October because of 2 blood infections
    IVIG and 2 blood transfusion => because of the blood infections (all within
    about a month of October)
    Several IV albumin infusions => to reduce the swelling

    Current Medical Treatment:
    Lasix (diuretic)
    Enalapril (high blood pressure)

    I give her only half the dose she should be getting.
    We give her Lasix only when she really swells up, otherwise it gets
    impossible to read her points.

    Biontology Sessions:
    She has been treated since August with not much progress (heavy medication
    slowed things down)

    Questions:
    1. Can the lack of progress be caused by  all these IV infusions?

    2. Should we stop treatment and wait recommended 6 months since last
    transfusion?

    3. Is albumin infusion as bad as blood transfusion and IVIG?

    4. Shouldn't this be mentioned in the manual in CONTRADICTIONS? It seems
    like a big NO NO ...

    Answers:
    1. Infusions can cause endorphins, and maybe that is why the Kidneys don't
    drop anymore. Anything that enters the body circumventing the metabolism is
    an infusion of pure toxins, thereby increasing the toxic load of the body,
    so it can definitely contribute to the lack of progress. 
   
    But the main reason can also be the high blood pressure medication. I have
    found that high blood pressure medication can be very damaging to the
    Kidneys, thereby causing lack of progress,
   
    2. I would not stop the treatment as this for sure will cause her health to
    regress in this stage. Concentrate on Kidneys and Circulation, especially
    the Venal system.

    3. Any infusion is as bad as a blood transfusion

    4. I do not think there should be mention of this as a contra-indication. I
    do not see any reason for this. In this case not treating is worse than
    treating. The Kidneys need help desperately. 

    In the case of transfusions, every choice needs to be weighed individually.
    If there is no urgency because of a life threatening situation, it is
    advised to wait until the blood has completely been replaced by new blood
    cells. Other transfusions will be detoxified sooner. 
   
    Because transfusions are such a burden to the body, if in any way possible,
    you want to give the body time to deal with it before you start Chiren
    treatment. You always want to be gentle and respectful as much as possible.
    But the treatment of your daughter cannot wait.

    Thank you  for the explanation. My daughter hasn't had any infusions of any
    sort since beginning of December. 
   
    Questions:
    1. Can the infusions from December be still causing endorphins and
    affecting Chiren readings and causing the Kidneys not to drop ? 

    2. Or is it the blood pressure medication that is causing the kidneys not
    to drop?

    3. Since she is now only on diuretics (which she gets only when the
    swelling worsens) should we start seeing drops in her Kidneys soon (as a
    sign of the reading being correct and not affected by medication)?

    4. Are the diuretics affecting the reading and therapy as much  as the
    blood pressure medication? 
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    March 2015 edited March 2015 Flag
    Answers:
    1. The infusions can definitely still cause endorphins if the body has not
    excreted the toxins as yet.

    2. Blood pressure medications CAUSES Kidney problems, and this means that
    there should be drops.

    3. But another reason that the Kidneys do not drop might be that there is
    not anything wrong with the functioning of the Kidneys themselves. It might
    be something else that causes the problems.
    If she temporarily swells up, there might for example be a passing Adrenal
    or Circulation problem, caused by something like bad sleep or something
    else that exhausts.

    4. I have never observed this with diuretics. Blood pressure medication
    normally keeps the Kidney points dropping, not the other way round.

    Personally I think the Kidneys might not be the problem at all, they are
    definitely not the cause.

Hemorrhoids and Blood Cancer

liselottewliselottew
June 2015 edited July 2015 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
Man, 60 years old, farmer. Treated him for a while. 

Medical interventions: 
Removed appendix 
Surgery to remove a fistula on anal opening 

Medical diagnosis:
Waldenstrom's disease (type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma) => blood cancer 

Medical drugs:
Medication for Waldenstrom's a year ago

Previous Treatment:
Apart from normal treatment I also ran a Whiplash treatment the first session
over the area where the Appendix was removed. Then I put one light rod in front
of stomach and the other one on the back. 

Today's Session

Current symptoms:
Leaking hemorroids, when walking => no constipation, daily bowel elimination
Feeling of having tight socks on feet, sticking. 
Headache => I do not remember the location  

Measurement:
Large Intestine - Bact Proteus 

> 12 yrs treatment: 
All 4 Intestinal Flora bacteria, Nux Vomica, Hamamelis, Solidago, Mucosa

2nd Measurement:
Kidney (proximal point) - Cystopyelonephritis (Calculi did not match) 

Footplate treatment:
Cystopyelonephritis, Populus, Glyoxal, Engystol, Echinacea, Berberis, Selenium,
Hepar

3rd Measurement:
No drops

Questions: 
1. Recently I read that I needed to have a maximum of 7 centimeters between
glas rods if there is an actual physical scar. How, after surgery, do I then
administer the Whiplash treatment to treat the location of the operated anal
fistel. This is a very private part and hard to treat locally. Any suggestions
of how to do this? 

2. I saw in a different post that the cause for haemorrhoids could be
constipation and too much pressure. What other causes can there be? He was
bleeding from the Intestines before, but that has stopped a while ago. 

3. Do you have any suggestion on how to proceed?

    Answers:
    1. I can understand that treating the scars may be delicate in this area,
    and it is possibly not needed. It all depends on how he heals and how it
    will effect the meridians. But maybe, if it is all too uncomfortable for
    both you and your client, you can ask his wife (does he have one?) to
    assist you? You can instruct her and leave the room. I don't know another
    solution...

    2. This question was answered here: LINK

    3. I have little insight in what his symptoms were before and what remedies
    you treated him with, but since this man has been a farmer probably almost
    all his life, I wonder if you have found Insecticides on him.
    And did you ever measure Diverticulose or Periproctic Abscess on him? These
    are both indicated for fistula.
    With severe haemorrhoids there is always the factor of mechanical strain
    from bowel movement, which will delay healing. Eating fiber will make the
    stool soft and elimination less straining, so this may be an additional
    suggestion. 
    My personal experience with treating clients with haemorrhoids is that,
    depending of the severity of the issue, it can take a lot of time to
    improve. 

    It is also important to note that the symptoms do not completely match the
    measurement.  In case of present haemorrhoids drops on the Veins are to be
    expected.

    Current Symptoms:
    Haemorrhoids => for over 20 years
   
    Previous Symptoms:
    Tingling of the tongue as if burned and healing => almost gone now 
    Blood in stool => gone
    Fistula on his back => completely gone 
    Exhaustion => gone
    Night sweats => gone
    Cramping in the fingers => gone
    Headache => was gone when Kidneys stopped dropping, but today the Kidneys
    dropped again and he also had a headache again.
    Leaking Haemorrhoids => has become better, sometimes completely gone, but
    then they come back

    Previous measurements/treatments:
    Kidneys => Calculi Renales => many times
    Veins => Aurumheel 
    Large Intestine => Diverticulose
    Small Intestine => Ulcus Duodeni + Salmonella Paratyphi
    Stomach =>  Leptospirose (no more drops on Stomach after this remedy was
    use once)
    Lungs => Insecticides + Inverted Swine Flu vaccine (own remedy) 
    Liver => Zirrhose Hepatis

    Questions
    1. I also thought it was odd that I did not measure any drops on the Veins.
    What could be the reason that I did not measure them?
   
    2. When you say haemorrhoids can take a lot of time to improve, about how
    many sessions can that mean?

    Did this man come for his haemorrhoids or for his blood cancer? You seem to
    focus on this symptom at the moment. Is the blood disease gone? I would
    consider this more serious..

    Leukemia is rectified by treating the Gallbladder/Liver system. Possibly
    this is also true for this type of blood cancer...

    However, this man has clearly Circulation/Venal problems.
    The haemorrhoids are leaking when he is walking, which means that under
    these circumstances there is not enough power in the valves to push the
    blood upward and gravity takes over. The fact that this man is a farmer
    might mean that he spent a lot of time sitting on his tractor thereby
    insufficient movement...

    It is very likely that the Veins have the same problem as the Arteries,
    namely calcification, and that this is causing the valves in the Veins to
    not be able to move properly.

    Specific treatment approach for haemorrhoids caused by calcified valves:
    I would treat with Barijdeel and Aurumheel, possibly also with Aesculus.
    When the calcification is gone, treatment with Hamamelis and Melllilotus
    can be used to treat the valves themselves.
    Nux Vomica is also a good supportive remedy for haemorrhoids

    Answers
    1. That the points on the Veins should drop is clear, since haemorrhoids
    are clearly a problem of the Veins. It is impossible for me to find out why
    you did not measure drops. There are many possible measurement problems.
    They are described in the manual.

    2. There is no way you can decide how many treatments are needed. It is
    possible to see IF there is calcification, but you cannot see how much. And
    it also depends on how much pressure there is on the rectum/anus.

    The reason he came for treatment was just his haemorrhoids, because he was
    told by the doctors that the blood cancer was impossible to cure. However,
    I have focussed a lot on the Liver in the past (it doesn't drop anymore)
    and his recent blood test was perfect he told me today.

    I do not know if this means his blood cancer is cured, because the doctor
    has told him it can come back and he has scheduled regular check-ups to
    make sure it doesn't.

    Session:

    Current Symptoms:
    Mild headache => on top of the head
    Lower leg tingling => improved
    Coughing (allergy?) => appears out of the blue sometimes when indoors (not
    often)
    Tongue tingling => almost gone
    Haemorrhoids => improved, less leaking
    Itching around anus

    Measurement:
    Veins - 3 points => Barijodeel

    >12 yrs Treatment:
    Barijodeel, Aurumheel, Nux Vomica, Selenium, Apis, Arnica, Pulsatilla,
    Injeel Chol

    2nd Measurement:
    Kidneystone point (slight drop, but not completely sure) => Calculi Renales

    Footplate Treatment:
    Calculi Renales, Calculi Biliaris, Solidago, Berberis, Engystol, Populus,
    Hepar

    Questions:
    1. I find it hard to find the last joint on the little toe and the Kidney
    stone point. Is the picture in the book correct, it looks like it is
    further up the foot than where the toe stops? There is so much soft tissue
    there, that it is hard to find the bone to stabilize the probe against.
    2. How do I know if the blood cancer is gone?
    3. Do symptoms and treatments match, and do you have any further comments
    or recommendations?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    July 2015 edited July 2015 Flag
    Answers:
    1. What do you mean by "the book"? 
    The Kidney stone point is the most proximal point on Kidney meridian that
    we measure. So furthest away from the nail point. It is measured on the
    joint that connects the toe to the body of the foot, and it does look like
    it is not on the toe anymore like with most proximal points (a bit higher)
    2. Whether the blood cancer is still there or not can only be determined by
    a medical test. If he goes into Spin Inversion there is a chance that it
    comes back.
    3. The treatment with blood vessel remedies is certainly more appropriate, 
    but I would even give more support for the Circulation and also use
    Circuio, Aesculus and Placenta for example.

    I have now treated this man a couple of times after your advice. I focused
    on Veins, wich was the only thing that still was dropping. Barijodeel and
    Aurumheel was what matched. Then I supported with Veins support remedies
    plus Nux Vomica. All of his symptoms are compleatly gone and he had no
    drops today on measurement.

Broken Neck - Thyroid Issues

slevarekslevarek
October 2013 edited October 2013 in Interesting Cases Flag
Client:
Young doctor, very active in the sports area. Very much into health living.

History:
Nearly every bone broken (doing crazy things)
Neck broken (5th Vertebrae) diving off a pier = needed a "halo brace" for
support while healing

Symptoms:
Brain fog
Thyroid dysfunction
Felt "disconnected" ever since the breaking of his 5th vertebrae. 

Treatment:
Followed Standard protocol.
All drops but the Thyroid point were corrected easily in the first 2 sessions.
Used Scar/Whiplash treatment from the neck over the head, down the body and
around back up to the neck. Repeated this with Procranium.
After this his Thyroid didn't drop anymore, but every other drop was resolved
too.

Results:
After this simple treatment.. he says he feels totally connected and so much
more clear in his mind.  
I have one more session with him, and am looking forward to seeing how he feels
this time.

    Thanks for sharing Sandra! This is a great example on how powerful Whiplash
    treatment can be.

    Did you also measure after just applying the Whiplash treatment in the
    neck? Because it was the neck area that was broken and also the only area 
    measurable (Thyroid drops) that could not be corrected with just remedies.
    I wonder which measurements led you to the assessment that other areas of
    the body were "whiplashed" and that you had to go around the whole back and
    front and what other drops where cleared by that...
   
    Just curious.

    Hi Karolina,

    Thanks for your reply.

    Yes I did measure right after the whiplash session and before any sessions
    with remedies. 

    Based off what he told me on all the bones he has broken in his body, I
    thought he must be really "off center" with the entire spine.. and after
    breaking his neck.. it just made sense to me to do this. He actually was
    able to swim back to shore.. and walk to the place where he was staying..
    His friends decided to call ambulance.. based off of what happened.. and
    the doctors just couldn't believe what they saw.. He was very lucky.. 
    However, what he said he experienced.. from all the drugs.. and the shock
    of this was the foggy brain, feeling disconnected. he has done many
    cleanses.. to clear the body's toxins but still experienced this disconnect
    with his brain.

    I saw him last night.. Measured.. he has responded so so well with the
    previous 2 sessions. Hardly no drops whatsoever.. and no spin, no whiplash
    required. He only showed drops on the intestines.. which were corrected
    with food poison remedies.. He told me he had had eaten this raw meat
    recently.

    Other than that all show correct.. 

    Also I did ask if he had been sleeping on any magnets as well. after my
    last client.. funny thing, he said yes he has something under his bed for
    the back.. on the floor and not on the mattress. SO I explained to him what
    this can do and he is going to remove it to see if something comes up
    afterwards which we can then address.

    Overall it was really a positive session with a very supportive client !

Measuring and Using Nosodes

    Questions:
    1. If the client does not have a drop on any of the Stomach meridians, how
    do I test if the Jaw remedies match? Or, are the jaw remedies used on the
    Foot Treatment? 

    2. Can nosodes be used on the Foot Treatment without testing to address
    symptoms?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    November 2013 Flag
    Answers:
    1. When there are no drops on the Stomach meridian, it is difficult to
    determine whether there are problems with the jaw.
    If the symptoms indicate a jaw problem and there are no drops, then you can
    be certain that there is endorphin production. This means that there is
    stress in the body, but not necessarily caused by the jaw..
    You could also try if the jaw nosodes match on the points of the Tonsils/
    Lymphatic points of the Ears. Often they affect these points as well.

    2. Nosodes are never used as Support remedy, they are only used when they
    match. Since you don't want to use more than 8 Nosodes you will very rarely
    use Nosodes on the Footplates.

    If I have used nosodes on the footplates to clear meridians not resolved by
    hand treatment. I understand my inability to clear more essential meridians
    in first hand treatment is due to inexperience. I have had greater success
    balancing others than during self treatment.

    Questions:
    1. Should I run a 2-7 after foot plate treatment with additional supports? 
    2. Is there ever a justification for using more nosodes than supports in
    the 8 footplate slots?
  •

    August 2014 Flag
    Answers:
    1. NO. There is no need to do this. This create the danger of
    over-treating.

    2. Normally there should be no need to use nosodes on the footplates. Focus
    on the Yang organs first (do not do anything with the Yin organs). There is
    no need to balance all the points.

    apply for membership of BATC. 
    There are a lot of rules en study hours yo have to have, otherwise you have
    to do some more studies. 

    * You have to earn points every year, so it can be intervision with Johan,
    study books or extra studies to be part of the BATC every year. 

    It is a lot of work but you are insured and you can give your clients the
    opportunity to come to you because if you are part of the BATC they can
    claim money in return and the sessions are cheaper. 
    You can reach a lot more clients and the ones who are very sick and can not
    pay the sessions too.

    Hope this helps,

September 2015 - Uterine Cancer

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
September 2015 in Q&A Flag
Question

What of the 3 types of cancer classifications does uterine cancer fall into? I
believe it is an over-toxic liver that is dumping toxins to other places, is
this correct? Even though the uterus is a sex organ, cancer there would not be
uncontrolled growth caused by the thyroid like fibroids, and it is not because
of a bag of fluids created by cysts so I am left with a bag of toxins produced
by the liver. Therefore, the correct way to treat is by detoxifying the body.
Is this all correct?

Answer

I do not see the logic in this reasoning, so it is hard to comment directly on
it. I will address Uterine cancer in general.

The Uterine is a sex organ, but not a sex gland. So the point for the Uterus is
not found on the Hormone System meridian, but on the Bladder meridian.

You summarized correctly that there are 3 causes of cancer:
1. Cysts
2. Fibroids
3. Encapsulation of toxins.

Cysts are caused by faulty Circulation. This fault in the Circulation is
normally caused by a chicane in one of the Lymphatic or Blood Vessels. This
chicane can be caused by Calcification or a Cramp.
Fibroids are caused by a malfunctioning Thyroid, which causes cell growth at
the wrong places. Uterine cancer is normally a fibroid first and then changes
its quality from benign to malignant.
Liver cancer is most of the time an encapsulation of toxins. In this case the
only way to dissolve is to detoxify and to stop accumulating more toxins.

Although Fibroids caused by Thyroid dysfunction are the most common cause for
Uterine Cancer, the other two options remain a possibility. You always need to
verify this by measuring and cannot assume anything.

    Regarding the causes of cysts, can we add the malfunction of the Adrenal
    Glands effecting the pressure of the blood in the Circulation in addition
    to other Circulatory problems (Calcification or a Cramp)? I thought the
    Adrenal Glands were the primary reason behind Cysts.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    September 2015 Flag
    Yes, weak Adrenals may also be a cause leading to cysts because the Adrenal
    glands provide energy for Circulation.
    Weak Adrenals = weak Circulation = backing up/pooling of fluids = cysts
    But this is not the primary reason for cysts.

Leukemia

m3pollack
March 2013 edited January 2014 in General Questions Flag
I have been treating a friend with Hairy Cell Leukemia, a very slow progressing
form.  

Symptoms: 
Nose bleeds and low energy - disappeared.  
Less subject to getting sick (colds & flu); 
Night sweats - diminished significantly, nearly disappeared, but made about a
20% resurgence during the month of no treatment.  

On March 1st he had his labs repeated after not having had a Biophoton
Treatment since Feb. 7.  His labs were worse!  How do we understand this?  I
know not to repeat labs within 5 days of treatment, but this was nearly a
month. Why are his symptoms dissipating so dramatically, but his blood work
does not corroborate the progress??

    In the first place I need to know what exactly was found in his blood work?
    Is it his Leucocytes? Or is it that he has "dirty" blood.

    * Dirty blood indicates that his Kidneys and Liver are not cleaning the
    blood properly and are leaving the dirt in the blood. The nightly sweating
    also indicates that his Kidneys are not doing their job properly. The
    Adrenals are then also indicated.
    Dirty blood you can treat with Aesculus, Sutoxol, Lymphomyosot and of
    course Kidney/Adrenals

    * If his white blood cell counts are still high, you need to look at other
    possible infections like Tonsillitis and Appendicitis.
   
    * Total blood will only come right when Liver/Gallbladder have come clean.

    I'd like to add that when a client is not completely recovered yet and you
    have a long break between treatments of nearly a month, there can be a
    falling back. This is also seen in the symptom of night sweats slowly
    returning.

    Thank you for your quick responses.  
    Yes, I have done Spin Inversion with him nearly every time, although this
    last time, he didn't show signs of inversion. He shared his lab reports
    with me (Dec, Jan, and Mar).  Would it be helpful to pass them on to you? 

    At the moment I am very pre-occupied; it seems that my mother is dying and
    I may have to fly out of here at any moment.  So, I apologize for not being

    I'm very sorry about your mother, no worries about the reporting. We just

    continue this discussion later if you want.

    The lab reports are not as helpful as a description of the treatments and

    Questions: 
    Has he been only hostile after he has been taking drugs? 
    Is the hostility perhaps drug induced?
    How did he feel before he was precribed drugs? 
    Which drugs?
    Is he depressed? 
    To whom is he hostile? 
    At what moments is he hostile?

    Hostility is always a Gallbladder/Liver issue. 
    You need to treat this first (after treating the normal first things), he
    needs to relax first.
    Keep asking questions, so that he can open up. Do not tell him anything,
    otherwise he will be on the defensive.

    I think he is afraid of being judged.

    Suppression by medication or otherwise always has a very bad effect on the
    Liver/Gallbladder, but also the stress caused by all different radiation
    sources he's exposed to attacks these systems.

    The aggravation of his symptoms in the morning can indicate that all the
    radiation is causing his problems, but don't forget he has been detoxing of
    drugs all night too..... this also gives physical complaints and tension.
    So there are many "causes" to work on.

    First I would advise him to at least sleep in a radiation limited
    environment, so without electricity, WIFI, phone, metal in the bed etc. 
    Getting the Gallbladder to relax, will be a big help in getting him off of
    the drugs. 

    Then since he obviously longs to express a lot of his problems to you, I
    would guide this by asking questions so answers that are already there deep
    inside of him can come out.... 
    We (Biontologists) are in the business of allowing the Self-Healing ability
    of both Body and Soul to take its course and the way to let emotional
    healing take its natural course is to ask and listen, so the client can
    express and gain consciousness. 
    The five element teaching from an emotional point of view can help you ask
    the right questions that lead you to the cause of his problems.

    According to the Five Element Teaching:

    Suppression, Inability to let go, Feeling of Loss of Control (with need to
    control), Self Judgement (and being critical towards others) are signs of a
    Metal (Lungs/Large Intestines) imbalance. When Metal overreacts on Wood
    (Liver/Gallbladder) this element gets a problem, hence the Escapist
    Behaviour (drugs), Anger and Hostility, which are all Wood expressions. 

    So to address the emotional cause of the Anger and Hostility (after you've
    treated the Gallbladder first!) you can ask: 
   
    Why and where he doesn't feel free in his life,
    If he felt a loss of control or boundaries in his life. 
    If he always was so self critical and where this originated, 
    If he is still able to see a positive future or has a goal (Positive Wood
    qualities)
    If he has healthy boundaries and structure (Metal) 
    And then why, why, why
    He has been hostile even before the accident, so the accident can't be the
    first cause...

    These are of course starting points and from there you can further allow
    the story to unroll without losing sight of what would be the healthy
    expression of these elements. For example finding a purpose in life (wood),
    creating a healthy structure or daily routine (metal),
    Don't tell your client, but you can suggest in a question.
   
    For example "Even if you don't feel you have a goal right now, what would
    you like to happen for you in the future? And then what would you want to
    do for this to happen?"
    Of course, this again is an example... There shouldn't be force in any of
    this, no projection, just acceptance of what comes up.

    The Five Element teaching is an invaluable tool in learning to see how
    energetic imbalances can lead to disturbed emotions and how disturbed
    emotions can cause the body to suffer.

Polio Vaccinated - No Pituitary Drop?

July 2014 edited July 2014 in Case Discussions - Student Flag
Client:
44 year old man, treated for the first time today. 

Medical interventions:
Has been vaccinated for polio... 

Measurement:
No drop in the Pituitary point! 
The Parathyroid did drop => Anti-Tetanus

Treatment:
Since there was no drop I did not put Poliomyelitis in the treatment. 

He is a runner but it had been 36 hours since his last run.

Question:
Could this be an endorphin mask?

    Answer:
    Yes, this is definitely a case of endorphins. Endorphins can be raised
    after exercise for 3 days.

    When someone has been vaccinated you can expect Poliomyelitis to show up in
    the first measurement. If you don't measure it, there is a measurement
    problem (in this case likely to be caused by endorphins). So even if you
    don't measure a drop on the Pituitary gland you should treat with
    Poliomyelitis the first session.

    Hello,

    I am a bit confused. I remember Johan talking about (during the last Q&A)
    putting remedies as long as we measure them. I guess the context was
    related to Rubella and Pertussis. He said that even if the person had these
    shots, we should only put them as long as we measure them and not before.
    He talked about the layers related to the masks which may come out by time
    and give respective measurings. He may be saying this not to burden the
    body as well.

    Question: Where do we draw the line when we decide to give such remedies
    without measuring. Would your idea apply to similar endorphin cases who
    needs to have rubella and pertussis remedies due to the shots taken before
    (theoretically).

    Thanks.

    July 2014 edited July 2014 Flag
    Yes, I think treating for the Endorphins would be the start...No? Use
    Plumbum, Atropinum and Viscum in measurement and or treatment.  A question
    though, A short 2-7 treatment ? As a novice I see this choice of treating
    the 'unmeasured', initial person based on clinical knowledge that Pituitary
    is often 'obstructed', if that's the right choice of words, by the
    vaccine......
  •

    July 2014 edited July 2014 Flag
    Hi Tufan,

    It is true that you should never put remedies in that are not showing up in
    measurement, but extensive experience has shown that Poliomyelitis and
    Anti-Tetanus under normal circumstances always show up the first session
    (that is, when these vaccinations were received). 
    When they don't show up it is a good indicator of endorphins or another
    measurement problem. Because they influence Pituitary and Parathyroid,
    which are very important to balance the first session, they should be
    treated no matter what. There are NO other remedies that are treated this
    way. 

    Hi Stefano,

    The choice to treat with Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus anyway has to do
    with the experience that the only reason these vaccinations (very rarely!)
    don't show up, is a measurement problem (like endorphins, edema of the
    fingers, a practitioner's difficulty with measuring the upper points etc).

    You could indeed try to get the endorphins down with Plumbum, Atropinum and
    Viscum. This often helps, but not always.

    Please understand that this is the only exception!

Hepatitis A - Outbreak

janjan
June 2013 edited January 2014 in General Questions Flag
Concern:
Recent contamination of berries from Costco, with Hepatitis A. It is said in
the news that anyone who has eaten the berries is at high risk of Hepatitis A
and it is highly contageous. A pharmacist was just put on leave because of
having eaten the berries (works with public).
Many of my clients consumed berries from the contaminated batch (bought it in
bulk for the community).

I understand that those in a high state of wellness will not have resonance
with the illness.
But since I am working with several very ill people I am worried that their
weak and compromised immune systems might not be able to deal with exposure to
Hepatitis A. I just do not want it to be transmitted through treatments (rods,
bathroom etc.)

It takes a week or two to know who are infectious carriers.

Question:
Should I consider putting a hold on treating the people who ate the berries
until the incubation period is past to avoid transmitting it to my sicker
people?

I am not an alarmist, I do however want to be careful when we know people may
be infected, and could be transmitting it. Thank you.

    This is your own professional decision to make. 

    IF there is a real danger, then close your practice for a while.
    But I would not in your case. 

    I doubt if a whole batch of berries can be infected by, what is basically
    an infection of the Liver (not a plant disease). 
    What I have seen is that at least 70% of the people have one form or
    another of Hepatitis, although normally it is suppressed...

    The problem could be that there is something on the berries that has the
    ability to cause an infection of the Liver but I doubt whether this is a
    virus. Plants do not normally harbour those type of viruses.

    But it is your choice....

    I believe being careful is never a sin ;-) 

    Putting a hold on your "exposed" clients' treatments could set them back
    though.... In these cases a Chikey with some cards would be a good
    temporary solution. At least this way they can maintain their weekly
    program of Light Treatment/Support until they can be measured again.

    Stopping treatment of clients that are in a fragile Upward Spiral is not a
    good idea is my experience... Once they start to fall back it will take far
    more treatments/effort to get to the same level of improvement again.

    Clients who already are relatively balanced and are ready to get less
    frequent sessions are not a problem to put on hold....

    I have only had to measure a dog once. I normally go by symptoms only when
    treating. The dog I measured had no symptoms but her blood tests were off.
    I used the dog's owner as a surrogate, she had her treatment first, and
    once all her points were cleared I measured the dog through her.  
    Here is another thread with the specifics on how to do surrogate

    I have measured and treated and also symptom treated many animals
    successfully...rabbits, chickens, dogs, for many various symptoms and all
    have shown great improvements if not completely corrected their symptoms.
    So just experiment with which way you want to treat. The measurement method
    is very time consuming, as you have to measure and balance the surrogate
    first and then measure and treat the animal, but if you have the time, it
    is much more successful that way and less treatments.

    Good Luck!

    Hi Johan,

    I purchased EKG pads that were highly rated from Amazon.com.  They have the
    gel already on them and they feel adequately moist.  I placed them inside
    each wrist. I put one of them, attached to a blue cable, into the port that
    normally holds the golden rod (upside down T symbol) and the other one,
    attached to an orange cable, immediately to the left (blue dot inside a
    blue circle icon).  I've tried running a standard program with the rods (so
    I’m connected to 4 cables).  Still no yellow or green bars show up in the
    window to the right.  That window is black.  I also tried using the pads
    with a client who is another registered nurse and is familiar with what the
    pads should feel like so I’m confident that is not the problem.

    My Chiren also stopped measuring again three times yesterday (two of the
    times were during the same session with a client).  It's becoming regular
    enough that my clients are getting used to it.  I try to make no big deal
    out of it and have no problem backing out and going back into the program
    to get it working again.  But now that I realize the box on the right is
    not showing the bars when it is supposed to, I'm wondering if there is a
    bigger problem with my Chiren.
    In your letter regarding the biofeedback feature, it sounded like the bars
    should show up even if the EKG pads are not connected to show the natural
    relaxing effect of the Chiren.  It indicated that connecting the pads
    allows for added functionality.  In other words the bars should be showing
    up regardless of whether the biofeedback function is enabled (as shown on
    page 18 and 24 of the manual).  I’ve never seen green or yellow bars during
    any treatment program. 

    Will the green and yellow bars show up when the Chiren is plugged into the
    wall?  Or is a battery pack required for that box not to be black?  Was
    Lillia correct that a special update is required for the use of the
    biofeedback function?  I have installed every update that has been sent,
    including the biofeedback update Lillia sent me yesterday (as I stated
    above).   I’m trying to determine if my problem is that a battery pack is
    not attached.  Or if there is a problem with the software that Lillia sent
    me (my Chiren shows the same update number as Lillia’s attachment).  And if
    bars of some sort, green or yellow, should be showing up as part of the
    basic Chiren functionality which has never been the case with my Chiren.

    The biofeedback should NOT function when not all four wires are connected
    to the body and the function is independent of the power source.

    I still suggest using an extra gel, in my experience then it will function.

    I also used the pre-gelled pads and with those it did not work for me but
    with the extra gel it worked.

    Hi Johan,

    I'm ordering some gel.  And will give that a try.

    Would you be willing to do a short video?  Or perhaps do a brief
    presentation on Viddler with an opportunity for us follow along with our
    Chiren and ask questions if we run into problems?

    I do think an interactive video would be helpful.  At this point I have no
    way of knowing my problem was a lack of gel or if the upgrade that Lillia
    sent me for the biofeedback program is not properly loaded.  How do I know
    if it is a problem with my upgrade?

    The gel fixed my problem and the biofeedback system is now working!  I
    tried it on two clients today who  seemed to enjoy having something to do
    during the two long treatment programs as well as the opportunity to
    participate in their healing process.  Thank you Johan!  :)  :)  :)

    about.
    I have noticed it, but not been able to understand it.
    Unfortunately I am not able to recall this as a part of my training....

    Renate: do you mind posting a link to the EKG pads that you have tried and
    they worked?
    It would save us some time and worries whether it is correct type of pads
    and gel.
    Thank you from three practitioners in Hawaii!

    This is the gel

    These are the pads  

    I'm not sure the brand of ekg pads makes much difference.  The key is that
    liquid gel must be added to the firmer gel that comes on the pads.  When I
    start the program I press on the electrode to make sure it has good contact
    with the skin.  Then the yellow lines start to show.

    In addition you will need the biofeedback software update from Lillia if
    it's not already loaded in your Chiren.
    Please report back on how it works for you and if your clients like using
    it.

    We all have downloaded the programs. "New box" showed up on Chirens on the
    right side of the screen (when programs are running) but they are not
    active while programs are running. The only way for us to check would be to
    buy the same pads and gel and try it.
    Thank you one more time. Aloha!

    Also, Summer's number is listed, but no one else on the website. Now with
    Liz and Lillia gone its a little confusing whom to call for information
    about other biontologist I might recommend in certain areas, or other such
    things.

    Such as this morning, I'm wondering about the Go To Training link for this

    It is still the office in Walnut Creek that needs to be contacted for all
    these issues. 
   
    * Brass rods are available at the IABS office in Walnut Creek. 

    * Biontologists to refer clients to can be found on the practitioners map.
    This is the same map Lillia used to find practitioners.

    * Also questions about Go To Training will be answered when you contact

Children - Treating With 2-7 Two Times?

Candace Hsiao Young
February 2015 edited February 2015 in Case Discussions - Student Flag
Client:
5 year old boy

History:
Ever since an airplane flight -over one year ago- he often clears his throat
He recently slammed head into boards (he plays hockey)
WiFi in kindergarten classroom
His mother is concerned he was recently exposed to toxins from toast prepared
in an oven that was set on fire before use

Symptoms:
Cold symptoms, stuffy nose, sneezing
Dark circles under eyes
Hyperactivity
Falling a lot

1st and 2nd Session

Poliomyelitus and Anti-Tetanus were treated. Both of these nosodes were not
measured on boy during most recent -3rd- session , which was performed several
months after his initial two treatments.

3rd Session

Measurement:
Spin with saliva (child feared being pricked) 3X
Whiplash

2-7 Program:
Botulism => cleared all but Kidneys and Bladder
Calc Bil => Kidneys and Bladder

Supports => Reneel, Berberis, Causticum, Nux Vomica, Lymphomyosot, Aesculus

2nd Measurment:
Heart (L) - 1 point
Lung (L) - Alveoli
Large Intestine (L) - Peritoneum
Nervous System (L) - Autonomic Nervous System
Circulation (L) Aorta Abdominalis + Coronary Arteries

Hormone System (R) - Pineal Gland
Veins (R) - Arms and Legs

Kidney (L+R)
Gallbladder (L+R)
Bladder (L+R)

2-7 Program:
Insecticides
Barjodeel

Supports => Placenta, Causticum, Thalamus, Populus, Berberis, Arnica

3rd Measurement:
All points cleared except Veins (R) - Arms 

Question:
1. I recently treated a five year old boy and had to run the 2-7 program twice
to clear all points. Is this a no-no?
2. Did I miss something? I tried to measure for Appendicitis as all Large
Intestine and Small Intestine points dropped but no combinations worked.

    What points were dropping initially? This case is incomplete.

    There is no need to balance all points. The main things are the Hormone
    System and the Kidneys. If there is space after this, you can try the next
    layer.

    That both Kidneys and Bladder react on Calculi is very unlikely. 

    The dark rings under his eyes indicate a more serious problem and indicates
    either Kidney or Liver.

    Falling a lot is either caused by Spin Inversion or by Gallbladder or
    Bladder problems. But you never addressed the Gallbladder. 

    There was no need for 2 x a 2-7 program if you would have used less
    supports and more nosodes. Using Berberis and Causticum 2 x is strange. 

     Treating once with a remedy is sufficient and there is no additional
    benefit in adding it again to another program.

    If this is the 3rd session, how can she still (or again) have Whiplash? If
    there was no cause for Whiplash, drops on Parathyroid and Thyroid were
    caused by something different. Using Barijodeel at this stage is not very
    helpful because the Parathyroid was dropping.

    More info:

    This child is often in Spin Inversion due to his EMR exposure at home and
    school, and was treated for Spin Inversion several times following the most
    recent session.

    All points were dropping initially => Appendicitis nosodes + Chronic
    Tonsillitis were not able to clear as many points as Botulism. 

    Botulism and Calculi Bil cleared all points during first measurement. 
    However, after running the 2-7, it became clear these nosodes with the
    supports did not clear up the issues this child is suffering from. 
   
    Heart and Lung => full of drops during first measurement => I tried Strep
    and Staph but they did not resonate
   
    As I was not sure what to do, I remeasured against nosodes after the 2-7
    and noted that Insecticides and Barjodeel cleared all points.

    Perhaps, I should have tried Insecticides during first round, too.

    Follow up:
    Exactly one week after treatment (after a day of high EMR exposure in a
    small apartment with centrally located router, many wireless devices, and
    antennae) => fever, stomach ache, threw up several times, pain under his
    left eye (Stomach meridian?)

    I will continue to monitor him. Hoping this is the body unmasking and doing
    its best to heal from toxins or bacteria, and not effects of
    over-treatment.

    Heart and Lung should not be part of your focus in this stage (ALL points
    were still dropping!). They are both Yin Organs.

    Botulism and Calculi Bill are unlikely to correct all of these drops.

    Normally the remedies should do what you measured. Your measurement shows
    inconsistency  => Botulism and Calculi Bill did not clear all these points
    at all. This shows there is a problem with your initial measurement (and
    thus most likely with the final measurement too).

    What did this boy eat while visiting this apartment? Being overly concerned
    with EMR may cause you to overlook the obvious. This was most likely a case
    of food poisoning.

    February 2015 Flag
    Thanks, Johan. I am overly concerned with EMR at the moment and appreciate
    your reasonable input. The apartment visit came after my treatment. I only
    mentioned it as a follow-up to treatment. I have not measured many children
    so it is very possible there were inconsistencies. I found it strange I
    could not measure any combination of Appendicitis nosodes on client as that
    was my initial focus. Very possible I missed some combination.
  • 
    Candace Hsiao Young
    March 2015 edited March 2015 Flag
    Was it incorrect to check for food poisonings on LI and SI in this case? My
    focus was not Heart and Lung initially, it was finding the combination of
    nosodes to clear the most points. I mentioned the Heart Lung drops
    correlation more as justification for using Botulism.

    Should we not look for correlations during first measurement round if all
    points are dropping? Is it okay to check for Strep, Staph, Salmonella if
    Appendicitis nosodes don't work in these instances? And if these don't,
    what next to try?

    Ann's observations after treatments: 

    1st treatment:
    Felt wiped out 
    Felt like bursting (severe pressure) 
    Different areas of the body activating 
    Early AM
    Throat
    Night: Lower abdominal awareness. 
    I felt the light traveling from  lower to upper parts of my body.
    By day 7 - hollow, cutting feeling from throat to stomach came back in AM
    and energy weak.

    My comment:
    One can see that leaving out the Kidney foot plate how this taxed Ann's
    kidneys I read the 'bursting' as water pressure

    2nd Treatment:
    Gradually felt much more focused at 3rd eye  
    Energy much more stable => great improvement in energy drops 
    Hollow, cutting feeling along the mid line of my abdomen, very rare now.  
    Pain in neck and shoulders

    My comment:
    The inclusion of the liver Hep remedy made for too much detox and her
    shoulder/neck received the toxins.

    3rd Treatment: 
    Pain in neck and shoulders gone.  
    More aware of ease in mind, especially when focus at third eye.  
    More radiant, trusting and not overwhelmed, psychologically by tasks.  
    Emotionally also accepting the release of 'friends' who are very needy and
    unreliable.  
    Inner sense seems fuller, integrated and light. 
    Very grateful for the treatments.. 
    Feeling the intelligence of the light and releasing need to 'control'.

    My comment:
    A lot more sensible treatment and a lot deeper, emotional calm.

    Hi Stefano, since you have already changed your approach and you are
    continually evolving and improving your sessions, my comment is mainly
    meant for anyone who reads this thread in the future. Probably you know
    already that:

    1. You should never use Liver Nosodes early on in the treatment, only when
    all exit channels (intestines and kidneys!) are cleared and the liver is
    ready you can start to focus attention to this organ.

    2. You used far too many nosodes and too little support in the 2nd
    treatment. Try to use no more than 8 nosodes (hand treatment) and then use
    8 supports (footplates)

    3. Never use an extra short program after the footplates, unless the
    Kidneys or the Hormonal System are still dropping (when you are skilled
    this will hardly ever happen..) And if, for example, the Kidneys are still
    dropping, find the one nosode that corrects it and maybe add one specific
    Kidney support remedy => leave the other slots open!

    4th Session:

    1st Measurement and Treatment:
    Parathyroid - Anti-Tetanus (repeated)
    Hypoglycemia - Billiary Cirrhosis
    Sex Gland - Luesinum
    Large Intestine (R) - Chronic Appendicitis
    Lymphatic System (R) - Chronic Appendicitis 
    Large Intestine - Appendicitis
    Larger Intestine - Chronic Tonsilitis
    Kidney - Calculi Renales
    Kidney - Berberis

    2nd Measurement:
    Hormones, Large Intestine, Small Intestine => all balanced

    Still drops on:
    Kidneys
    Stomach

    Foot Plate:
    Kidney (R-Ureter) - Caluli Billaris
    Kidney (L-Ureter) - Cystopyelonephritis
    Gall Bladder - Injeel Chol (drops in Gallbladder & Liver)
    Stomach (R-Teeth) - Kieferostitis
    Stomach (L-Teeth) - Granuloma Denti
    Kidney - Reneel (support)
    Stomach - Nux Vomica (support => history of stomach problems, morning
    sickness)

    Response to the treatment:
    Symptoms still improving 
    Better sleep continues
    Less aggravation after the treatment than before
    Jaw aches
    Slight stomach upset for a couple of days after the treatment

    Questions:
    1. The repetition of the Anti Tetanus for the Parathyroid made me wonder if
    this is because of my reading or that the client failed to accept it, or
    that it needed another treatment??

    2. I also could not find the suggested remedies for the Sex gland (Ovarium,
    Hormeel, etc), so I pursued a nosode of the bacterial/viral sorts.
    In retrospect I wondered if I did too much on the footplate due to my
    desire to balance as well as support. I know you say to use more support in
    the footplate. 

    3. Since the use of the Tonsilitis, Appendicitis, etc. are not bacterial/
    viral nosodes would one, or could one expect these to come up for the
    intestines in the future?

    Thank you

    Hi Stefano,

    I'm on my way out the door so I don't have time to thoroughly read your
    post.  I did see that you mentioned my name in regards to using a bacteria
    to treat the hormone glands so I want to quickly respond to that.  It is
    not something you learned from me. 

    I always focus on the terrain first.  In the case of the sex glands I would
    have tried a nosode like ovarial cyst on the rods and then supported
    appropriately on the footplates  The supports you mentioned should be
    standard in your Chiren.
  • 
    SVitale
    July 2014 Flag
    Thanks, I did try the ovarial cyst and all the other items in the suggested
    list that is why I went for the bacterial nosode.  Is this incorrect?  I
    don't want to suggest that you said anything of the sort in your class. I
    was simply making a reference to your class as it provoked me to think, as
    your class always does.  I am also confused as to what exactly is meant by
    the 'terrain' first.


  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    July 2014 edited July 2014 Flag
    Terrain first means that the right sequence of treating the meridians is
    most important. The focus should not be on a specific bacterium or other
    infection. However a nosode of an infection of course can be necessary to
    treat the terrain… We emphasise focussing on and treating the terrain
    because there is too much of a tendency to lose the larger picture and just
    think like this: 

    "client comes in with diagnosis = staph infection => treat with staph
    infection, and if necessary several times and then we're done…"

    This is NOT the way to balance a client's condition according to Biontology
    protocol. Even when there's a diagnosis of staph infection, you still need
    to assess and treat in the right sequence. The staph infection might not
    even show up the first time for example (and especially not on the
    meridians of your focus).
   
    I will comment on your case another time. I'm busy with finding a new way
    of explaining the measurement protocol and also with creating a treatment
    protocol (although Johan thinks it is impossible to cover every aspect… I
    can at least try to put something on paper).
  • 
    SVitale
    July 2014 Flag
    Yes, that's the way I understand it. thank you
    Good luck with the protocol, but to give it justice, it is rather
    comprehensive, but as I have said before it's a lot to comprehend and
    digest at first.

    Hi Stefano,

    Think of the terrain as a pond in your yard that has become a stagnant,
    foul, and putrid swamp. Mosquitos will be attracted to it. To solve the
    problem you could go into your yard every day and swat at the mosquitoes in
    an attempt to kill them off. You soon discover that there is no way you can
    possibly kill every mosquito. There will always be some remaining that will
    breed in the swamp replenishing those you killed. You eventually come to
    the conclusion that instead of dealing with the symptom of mosquitos, you
    need to drain the pond, and replace it with fresh running water. The
    mosquitos quickly decide that the neighbor’s pond is a better environment
    to be their host.

    The swamp is the body’s terrain. The mosquitos are the bacteria, fungus,
    viruses, and spirochetes that find a weakened terrain is a great
    environment to reside in.

    It is said that Luis Pasteur who invented pasteurization made a deathbed
    confession: He realized that he had spent his entire life chasing bugs only
    to find that the problem was actually the terrain. While this may be an
    urban legend, it is a point well taken.

    In Biontology, we always focus on the terrain. While we sometimes need to
    also deal with the bugs which can affect the terrain, if the bugs become
    the primary focus we will only be doing symptom treatment which is never
    the goal of Biontology.
  • 
    SVitale
    July 2014 edited January 28 Flag
    Thank you . Yes, Bechamp, Pasteur and the Terrain is a familiar concept in
    homeopathy. The way I understand the homeopathic theory: In using
    homeopathic remedies such as nosodes we are still treating the terrain
    since we are not 'actively killing' the pathogen, but the Terrain is being
    'educated' by the nosode to neutralize itself to it. That is how I was
    trained in homeopathy. So, as Karolina is saying, the 'viewpoint' is the
    issue - as per - actively going after a bug is not treating the terrain,
    but being distracted by the pursuit of the bug. I was trying to figure out
    if Biontology's approach was the same as the traditional and contemporary
    homeopathic approach that I learned in my studies. I see that it is
    basically the same!

    Good question. 

    Questions:
    A. After a block of treatments, is it good practice to let a client take a
    break to let all the detox fully happen, or to recover from detox itself? 

    B. Is the time suggested between treatments a minimum time or is it
    necessary to treat within a specific timeframe for best results?

    Answers:
    1. First find the bacteria that might be present.
    If one of the Calculi matches, you should also use the other one as well.
    In combination it works better. I suggest you use Reneel as support.
    Also the remedy Barjodeel can be used as support because it is a remedy
    that breaks down calcium deposits. In addition you can also use the other
    Kidney support remedies.

    2. Feeling swollen and sore probably has nothing to do with the scar
    treatment. When I review your case I suspect the cause is the Appendicitis,
    which causes Gallbladder inflammation. Bloating is always caused by the
    Gallbladder system and the lack of Intestinal Flora.

    With Appendicitis and Tonsillitis still present, there is a lack of
    Intestinal flora and the Intestinal bacteria cause problems elsewhere in
    the body. I suggest you put the 4 bacteria in the slots and start measuring
    to see if they match anywhere. I could imagine they would match on the
    Kidneys and the Gallbladder system, possibly on the Liver. Bacterium
    Proteus is also indicated as possible cause for Ovarian and Prostatic
    cancer.

    A & B A week in between treatments is always optimal. Longer lapses can
    cause a regression, and shorter time in between treatments can cause an
    overburdening of the body. Only the first and second treatment should have
    no more than 5 days between them.

    Bacterium Proteus is also indicated as possible cause for Ovarian and
    Prostatic cancer.

    This statement needs elaboration:  there are many bacterial nosodes, and
    based on the theory of Pleomorphism, they 'mutate' into various other
    forms, cancer virus being one of them.  Is there a source of this material,
    whereby we can find the links between bacteria and other conditions?  Or is
    this out of our scope?

    I have read a summary of studies that all reported a link between Bacterium
    Proteus and prostate cancer and ovarian cancer.

    The idea that cancer is caused by a virus has long been rejected by the
    scientific community.

    Homeopathy has long been rejected by the scientific community.  ;)  My
    words adjusted:  we have a link between Bacterium Proteus and ovarian and
    prostate cancer, are you aware of other links that would be helpful in
    'balancing' in our work?  Links between breast cancer and ?  Or stomach
    cancer and ?? Or bladder cancer and ??...

    I am a scientist too, and there is nothing wrong with science as such. But
    also with science you need to have discernment as with everything else.
    The idea of cancer possibly being caused by a virus was first embraced by
    the scientific community. There has been 20 years of research that
    disproves this theory. Research is valuable, when it is used without
    anterior motive than to find the truth. 

    Homeopathy has been proven in many scientific studies, and as such there
    are scientist who embrace this idea. But of course there is the dogmatic
    part of the scientific community that does not want to change their view on
    reality, and unfortunately they dominate and terrorise others who are open
    to new ideas.

    In my own experience with cancer over the years. There is no causal effect
    of virus infections in cancer. 
    All the above is not relevant to Biontology treatments.

    In Biontology you need to look for the underlying systemic cause, which is
    Circulatory if the cancer originated in a Cyst, or an under-functioning of
    the Thyroid when the cancer originated in a fibroid tumor/polyp, or overall
    high Toxicity of the body.

    Thanks, Johan....I agree, I do read papers and research making links
    between viruses and cancer, though, as in EBV and liver cancer, etc. 
    This is an aside, the essence of my query is:  as you see Bact Proteus in a
    causative relationship with ovarian and prostate, can you add any other
    such links.....

    I hope I can make Johan's comment a bit more clear:
   
    "In Biontology you need to look for the underlying systemic cause, which is
    1. Circulatory if the cancer originated in a Cyst, or an under-functioning
    of the 2. Thyroid when the cancer originated in a fibroid tumor/polyp, or
    overall high 3. Toxicity of the body."

    Finding the one Cause between these three possible causes for cancer is
    what you should focus on, as the bacteria are secondary to the terrain.
    First you need to find out what the origin of the cancer was.

    1. Test the points that are related to the area of the cancer. For example,
    points on the Large Intestine meridian for Colon cancer:
    1. If a nosode of a Cyst (e.g. Ovarian Cyst) matches => root cause is
    Circulatory
    2. If a nosode of a myom/fibroid (e.g. Myom Uteri) matches => root cause is
    Thyroid
    3. If a Toxin or Galium matches => root cause is overall Toxicity of the
    body (also connected to eliminatory functions)

    2. Use the nosode that matched in the assessment, but more importantly:
    focus on the underlying cause!
  •

    August 2014 edited August 2014 Flag
    Ah, thanks, I think I got it.  
    So, if Cyst, a focus on the Circulatory meridians for the balancing item. 
    For a Fibroid/Polyp we look at the Thyroid hormone and balance.  
    If Toxicity is the cause then use Toxins or Galium to balance. 

    Questions:
    1. In other words, if we find that Ovarian Cyst matches for the Uterus or
    Sex Gland then we know that the cause is in Circulation. Now then we
    Support the treatment with Circulatory remedies??? Or do we look for
    nosodes on the Circulation meridian, for example.??
    2. As for the match of Myom Uteri on these points, we know the cause is
    Thyroid, so do we then go to the Thyroid and search out nosodes for the
    Thyroid? 
    3. Concerning your particular example, Large Intestine, if a Cyst, we look
    for a nosode on the Large Intestine meridian, would that nosode possibly be
    Ovarian Cyst, or more likely a bacterial nosode?

    Answers:
    1. Yes, when you find Ovarian Cyst anywhere it shows you that there's the
    energetic quality of a cyst. And whenever there's a cyst there's an
    underlying circulatory issue. In this case you should first check the
    meridians for Veins and Arteries and try to find the remedies that match
    there. Usually the remedies for the Circulatory system are not nosodes, but
    support remedies as listed in the measurement protocol. Also if the 
    2. Yes, if the Thyroid drops you need to find the remedies or treatment
    (Whiplash) needed to correct it, and then also use Thyroid support
    remedies. If the Thyroid does not drop you can still use Thyroid support in
    case of fibroid tumours.
    3. For cysts anywhere in the body, so also in the Large Intestine, you can
    use Ovarian Cyst to test for it. The focus of treatment again should be the
    Circulatory system.

    Hi Karolina, What would provoke one to think of Ovarian Cyst if it was not
    in the ovaries.  Say one had a cyst on the Liver and it was not known.....
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    August 2014 Flag
    Usually you start to measure for the less common solutions when nothing
    else works. 

    But another reason to check the Liver with Ovarian Cyst is when something
    odd was observed, for example on a scan.. or when you want to check what
    the origin of a Liver tumour is.

    Also… Circulation is corrected a long time before you get to the Liver.
    Even when there was a cyst it may have been taken care of by the body by
    the time you finally get to treat the Liver…

Dyslexia Program

peteralbpeteralb
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Programs Flag
Hi
My wife is a teacher working with children who are diagnosed as dyslexia in 
different degrees. Some of the children would like to be treated with the
Chiren and the Dyslexia Program. I would like to know the exact protocol for
this.

If you use only Dyslexia Program:

Do you test them for Spin Inversion?
What remedies should be applied on the footplate's (Thalamus and Viscum)?
The children are between 10 and 11 years.

After reading Lightnet 2 I can see that with Chikey recommended are perhaps 
daily treatments. So how many treatments and how often?

best regards Peter

    First the children have to be completely clean, especially the Hormonal
    System. So you start with regular treatments without the Dyslexia Program.
    You have to be extra aware of Whiplash, which is avery important factor in
    Dyslexia.

    Then the Dyslexia Program needs to be applied as often as possible. Optimal
    is every day. 

    For Dyslexia treatment you only use Viscum, Thalamus and Cerebrum and no
    other remedies on the footplates. (This is not true for your regular
    footplate treatments that is part of the Biontology session with adults who
    usually don't have Dyslexia, this only uses up your slots)

    I would do it 10 days and then take a brake of 2 weaks an then again 10
    days. The maximum number of treatments I ever needed for Dyslexia was 40,
    the minimum was 10. 

    During treatments and in between too, the child has to do reading exercises
    to determine if the condition has improved.

    That is what I meant, only when you measure it or only when it makes sense

    February 2013 edited February 2013 Flag
    I think I haven't communicated it well to my trainers or they might have
    misunderstood.

    My way of teaching and the protocol didn't change. Viscum, Thalamus and
    Cerebrum  were only part of the Dyslexia treatment, this hasn't changed is
    was always intended just for Dyslexia...

    This confusion has been caused, because the Dyslexia Program was also used
    on the adults at the end of their session, but this remedy combination was
    never intended for people who don't have Dyslexia.

    I hope on this forum I can clarify more of these misunderstandings, that
    became common amongst practitioners in the last years.

    So Johan, What do you typically do for children < 12? Now i understand more
    about what you don't do.

    Of course standard protocoll spin/whiplash/scar if measured or present then
    Triple Warmer: childhood illness/ vaccines etc.

    My question is once you find what ' balances' the disturbance in
    this child's light do you do just one 2-7 program and that is it? (after
    the things mentioned above of course)

    I am just a little confused, so for clarification sake...

    When you say only when you measure it...  I understand you to mean when we
    measure Viscum on the Pituitary or Thalmus on the Pineal or Cerebrum on the
    Nervous System we add it.  

    Question: Do we then add it (when we measure it) on the Footplates, or if
    it matched when measured do we add them in with the nosodes on the under 12
    program?

    And,  we can choose to add them as Supports without measuring in particular
    cases such as Cerebrum in ALS, Parkinsons, Alzheimers and like cases
    ...correct?

    Thanks for the clarification now and at the refesher. Just so you know,
    Johan, it was written in our class protocol (first several classes) to do
    the Viscum, Cerebrum and Thalamus every time. Thus, the confusion. 
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    April 2013 edited April 2013 Flag
    Yes you explained it correctly. 

    I you measure for one of these you can just add them to the >12 Program.
    Usually you won't need them to correct points, because you already did that
    with Nosodes and then you can use them just like any other Support.....
    according to Indication and Organ System you feel you should Support.

    We know that it was thought incorrectly in class, but there are many
    Discussions on this Forum were the subject was addressed.

Fire melts Metal.  Metal cuts Wood.  Wood covers Earth.  Earth contains Water. 
Water puts out Fire.

    There is a good diagram and explanation of the Five Elements on my
    acupuncturist's website

    To better understand the Five Element Theory myself, I recently attended a
    lecture given by Dr. Nan Lu, my acupuncturist and a Qi Gong master.
    According to him, in classical Chinese teachings the sixth and most
    important meridian is the Triple Warmer. What biontologists refer to as the
    hormonal meridian, the Chinese originally called the Ear Meridian and
    considered most powerful and an invisible mystery meridian. They use the
    phrase "I see without eyes" to describe it. Purely energetic, without
    associated organs, the Triple Warmer meridian controls the lymph nodes and
    immune function.

    Dr Lu embraces modern science and quantum physics-- oftentimes drawing
    parallels between TCM and Einstein's theory of relativity-- and talks about
    energy in terms of frequency. I found this all interesting as a student of
    Biontology. It made me wonder whether or not there might be more actual
    correlations between TCM and Biontology practice than we currently believe.
    Branches of chinese medicine practice passed down from masters do not
    always mirror textbook TCM which is often used only as a general framework.

Chikey Redesign - WHY?

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
August 2014 edited August 2014 in H.A.A. Messages Flag
Since there are already misunderstandings going around, I will explain as to
why IABS is discontinuing Chikey production in it's current form (with the card
reader)

The Real Reasons:

  • Redesign and exploring new markets is purely a matter of sustainability
  • Sales of Chikeys to practitioners has been, and still is insufficient with
    the current profit margin 
  • There are not enough Chiren courses to sustain IABS, we need more Chikey
    sales
  • For a consumer product the Chikey is too expensive and too complicated
  • At IABS we need one full time staff member (+ office space) every day to
    just explain the workings of the Chikey. This is unaffordable for IABS
  • The Chikey is not as easily understood by practitioners as we anticipated
  • Chikey was designed for use with Biontology protocols, but it is now
    frequently used without responsibility and without taking into
    consideration the possible harm that wrong treatment can do
  • Irresponsible use of the Chikey card function (remedies) puts IABS, the
    manufacturer and all other practitioners into a position of too much
    liability


Solutions We Found:

  • Exploring new markets that are lower in maintenance than the people's
    market (e.g. food, agriculture and animals) 
  • Making the Chikey a consumer product so it can reach more buyers
    independently of practitioners 
  • Making the redesign much simpler so it will be self-explanatory 
  • These new markets are more accessible for research purposes too. I like to
    spend more time in research again and retreat from teaching.


The False Reason:

  • There are rumours that that the FDA had something to do with it. It
    definitely has not.


I deeply regret that the practitioners who have been using the Chikey the right
way, and who have supported IABS by marketing them among their clients will
have to do without the Chikey in the future… I see no other option.

    Dear Johan,

    From a practitioner's perspective, and I feel I may not be alone, I would
    still love to imagine that there may be a way to make Chikey available.

    For instance what if IABS did not provide support but the Support was only
    to be given by the practitioner who sold it? There could be an online class
    solely dedicated to understanding Chikey where the practitioners can pay to
    enroll to be able to sell them to their clients. That way IABS could fully
    eliminate any overhead on customer service, and this reduction in cost
    could be reflected in Chikey sales price and IABS can operate as a shipping
    ware house for the practitioners.

    In my experience Chikey has proven to be an invaluable tool for creating
    more interest/business in Biontology as well as happier clients who needed
    frequent biophoton correction. We ask you please to to reconsider a way to
    make it still available with a different sales model perhaps where the
    Liabilities for IABS are eliminated and the practitioners who want to sell
    it have agreed to a rule of conduct perhaps?

    I Agree with you totally Hakan.
    This has been my feeling as well. Just as we practitioners are getting the
    know how on how to sell and inform to our clients.. the Chikey no longer
    exists. 
    Would love to see a way to bring it back.

Spare Parts & Chikeys

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
July 2015 edited July 2015 in H.A.A. Messages Flag
There has been confusion around the issue of spare-parts in the US and the
Chikeys. If anyone has questions or problems around these topics, please get
them out of the way by expressing them here, instead of adding to yet more
negative rumours.

Here some of the facts:
1. Spare parts have remained available always. Even when IABS was closed
everyone could order through Europe (like the rest of the world) be it that it
naturally took more time between placing an order and actually receiving the
product(s).

2. Because of this delay, Sylvia offered to start her own business in
spare-parts in the US to accommodate practitioners better and faster, but
because no one can work for free she needed to raise prices to make this
realistic. This business is ran independently from Health Angel Foundation, and
thus all communication about orders should go through her.

3. Health Angel Foundation had great difficulty keeping up with orders of
single Chikeys, and could not afford the extra staff needed to manage this. In
order to help us, and also because he wanted to start a new business in
Biontology, Joseph offered us to buy all 50 left-over Chikeys. Naturally he
needed to raise the price to actually make this a business. He has received
several unwarranted negative emails about the price ($1500 per Chikey including
5 personalised cards) he is asking. How many of you work for free? He never
intended for his market to be the practitioners, and wanted to cater to his own
growing circle of clients. Maybe it was my mistake posting his address on the
website, but I wanted to give everyone a chance to at least buy one last Chikey
if you want to...

4. Health Angel Foundation has only kept 15 Chikeys behind for the Chiren
referral promotion and warrantee issues. There are no Chikeys left that can be
ordered.


Post from Sylvia about her business:
I am ready to accept direct orders. You can call me to place your order at
978-740-5100 (please leave a message so I can call you back) or you can email

    yet. We just talked with her about how we are going to arrange it, because
    of everybody living so far apart. Most likely it is going to be a video
    conferencing class... 

    About the Case Studies, I'd like to emphasize that, although the success
    part is important of course, the most important part of a Case-Study is
    that you show your understanding of Biontology (measuring, assessment,
    protocol, etc.). The thing is that miracles are inherent to the Chiren, but
    the more skilled you are the more the miracles will happen and the less
    treatments you need.... So how you work is what Johan likes to see. 

    To prepare your Case Studies you can use the format on "use of the forum",
    with the addition of your thinking process.
    I hope this is in line what you've already been doing. But I know we didn't
    explain a lot about the Case Studies yet, so I thought it might be good to
    give some guidance...

    Hi Karolina - Thank you for your quick response. You wrote: "...although
    the success part is important of course, the most important part of a
    Case-Study is that you show your understanding of Biontology."  I
    understand that Johan needs to know HOW we are working with the Chiren, and
    that we are doing it properly. However, he also wrote something about that
    we must only show those cases that were 100% successful. This is why I
    wrote that I have much more than three. I think it would also be very
    interesting to send him case studies that did not work, so that we might
    understand more why that happens. I have about an 80 to 90% turnaround in
    people's health issues, but I also have those cases that seem to go
    nowhere. I am convinced that some people are afraid to tell the truth about
    the drugs they take or have taken, or about how much water they drink, what
    they eat, etc. I'm sure this can cause therapy resistance. I have tested
    "Coke" on a few people who said they never did drugs, and they resonated
    with it!

    Yes, you are right. The cases where you really get stuck are very
    interesting and that's why the Forum is there to post those cases so we can
    all think together. 
    Johan wants the Case Studies for Certifications to be 100% successful
    though and with a clear understanding of what you've measured, assessed and
    treated.

    Remember that measuring Coke doesn't prove that they have been using it.
    There might be other reasons for the resonance. Although to even try and
    measure Cocaine you probably had a suspicion already?

    Please send me the forms you received by mail so I can see if they're in
    line with what a Case Study should be. The form you are talking about is
    not from the IABS, so we don't know what they look like.

    Hi Karolina and Johan

    The Objectivity course will not be in the Babson College, the "live" course
    in Rotterdam has been.

    We will be doing video conferencing courses, but since you are not part of
    the video system, you cannot participate. 
    To set you up for the video system costs 1000 euro (1285 dollar) per year,
    so that's too much.

    I'm sorry for all the confusion.

    The first Objectivity course is organized as part of the new Curriculum for
    Students. 

    The Objectivitiy course for Certification will be organized in the Future.
    It is not known as for now if we are able to organize this for 2013. The
    intent is to provide extra study days as part of the Certification in 2014,
    but this year might be a little bit too optimistic...

    The main part of Certification for this year will be the signed agreement
    to work according to Protocol and Johan's teachings and to send the IABS 3
    case studies. When these are reviewed and approved one will be Certified
    throughout 2014. 
    Please also sign the agreement if you're on board with Biontology and the
    IABS, but feel the Certification is too big a step for this year (for
    example if you feel you don't have enough clients yet, or if you want more
    experience before you feel confident to send us cases)

    Due to circumstances I haven't been on top of it all...  I've discussed
    things with Johan and Lillia will send an e-mail out with the correct
    information about certification.

    I tried to find a file with "the signed agreement to work according to
    Protocol and Johan's teachings" to send with my 3 case studies, but I
    couldn't find it. Is this part of the Agreement that I already sent in,
    because I don't read this language on that page... Perhaps this came with a
    Lightnet newsletter that wasn't complete due to the garbled text before
    this last one, which I now received from Lillia in perfect format?

    The easiest thing to do is to put the newsletter as a pdf file on the Web
    site with a password for Biontologists and students only. This is quite
    easy. The person who puts the content (files) on the site with FTP can do
    this easily.

    Thank you for clarifying about the Objectivity Course.

February 2013 edited February 2014 in Symptoms Flag
Client:
Woman, treated two times

Symptoms:
Burning mouth => very acidic saliva. 

Doctor's advise:
Massive amounts of calcium supplements to keep her body more alkaline. 

Sessions:
Have not been able to balance her Parathyroid, Thyroid or Pineal glands. 
Small Intestine - lots of drops => Bact. Coli and Campylobacter Pylori matched

Advise:
I've suggested her to stop all the calcium supplementation and informed her
that her calcium metabolism is off.

April 2015 - Grounding

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
April 2015 edited April 2015 in Q&A Flag
Questions
Some people find it difficult to ground themselves and experience grounding
even as unpleasant.

A. Which meridian or meridians are involved, and what do you think is the
cause?
B. Is Spin Inversion or Hidden Spin Inversion involved in grounding?
C. What remedies can help with a lack of grounding?

Answers
A. Grounding is the energy flow from the head down, and mainly the Central
meridian, which cannot be measured, is involved. The energy flow can become
stagnated because of several reasons. There may be emotional reasons or too
much thinking, but Whiplash, scars or physical problems can also be reasons for
a blocked downward energy flow. Superficial breathing, stress and fear may also
cause a lack of grounding. So with this little information about the specific
“lack of grounding” that your client experiences, the other symptoms and the
measurement and history nothing can be said.
In general walking on shoes with rubber soles also causes a lack of grounding.
Grounding is best on a wet surface like grass.

B. Spin Inversion has nothing to do with a lack of grounding, but a lack of
grounding can weaken the energetic system or aura, which may make one more
sensitive to get Spin Inversion. But other physical and non-physical causes
that exhaust the body will cause the exact same weakness for Spin Inversion. So
there is no direct correlation between Spin Inversion and a lack of grounding.

C. This is hard to say if you do not give more information. No remedy will have
a lasting effect by itself. As always you need to find the cause.

    Has anyone heard before that grounding or earthing is now harder to access/
    do due to the increasing level of disturbances in our environment? One
    person I know claims you may need to go 10 metres below the ground surface
    to get to the earth's healing energy.

    My office is in an ocean town, Wilmington, NC and it's 'soaked' with WiFi,
    Wifi parks, coffee shops, coastal habitats....I'd say walking on the beach
    is still refreshing.  But the town is like any other town, but I think the
    ionic atmosphere with the electrical waves, Wifi and salted air make for a
    negative energetics.  I leave on Thurs to go to my country house, cows,
    tobacco and sheep as well as acres of solar farms and I feel relieved.

    I have to say that I'm not exceptionally sensitive but I am sensitve to my
    environment.  Even before the advent of WiFi I spent some time on Long
    Island and all I heard was the buzz of the electrical activity of thousands
    of homes on a flat surface between two water bodies, the Long Island sound
    and the Atlantic.  It was charged and frenetic.

Has BioGeometry been reviewed by Biontology?  If so what is the opinion?  The
work is based on geometrics in resonance with biological energies, a kind of
auric balancing.

    We have not reviewed BioGeometry. Is this - LINK - what you are referring
    to?

    Reading the website, I have a lot of questions about the applications and
    at the moment cannot say much about it.

    I know that geometry does have an affect on the people, the human body also
    has a certain geometry. 
    When you're young the doctor might say that you will grow out of it. You
    can grow out of it because as you grow, your body-geometry changes and
    because of this you might not be vulnerable to certain diseases. 
    That is why there are specific "children's diseases". Your dimensions are
    likely to attract certain illnesses or bacteria.

    I am very familiar with the geometrical structures of the frozen water
    crystals of the late Dr. Emoto.

    But actual trials with geometrical structures I have never done, but i
    think it can be compatible with Biontology.

    Thanks Johan, I don't know how BioGeometry goes about 'testing' their
    little charms.  It seems somewhat similar to using your brass rods,
    although the rods create a clear field around an area.  The BioGeometry
    states that one can put a small geometric figure on your cell phone or on
    your neck to protect one from the EMF field.  Intuitively this seems a
    stretch.
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel

    It is possible that a geometric figure on your cellphone could give certain
    protection.
    There are many dimensions, numbers, angles that create a very specific
    energetic effect: the sacred geometry.
    As far as I know it can only be tested in the only real laboratory: nature.

    That sacred geometry works I am sure of. Pyramids, the old master's
    paintings, certain bridges, the big museum in Cologne, they have all been
    made on the basis of sacred geometry.

    Whether the geometry used in this device is only beneficial I cannot tell.
    Everything that works can also work negatively if used without
    understanding and sufficient testing.

Structure

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
January 2014 edited December 2014 in About This Forum Flag
I'm very happy with all the effort everyone is putting in the posting of cases.
It clearly shows that a lot of attention is given to it.

However, to save Johan and me time of figuring out all the information, we
would appreciate a more structured presentation. Right now I'm still doing a
lot of editing of posts, even though I send the questions through to Johan (I'm
trying to find the time to write books…). Only this way Johan can glance over
them, to quickly see the issues…

I can honestly say that only to edit a post, sometimes takes me over an hour,
and this is crazy. So please help me out.

What I perceive as the biggest issue is the lack of a clear distinction
between:

History
Medication
Symptoms
Questions
Measurements
Your own thoughts
etc….. 

What I see a lot is that some history, a symptom, a medicine, a medical
diagnosis and a personal idea might all be contained in one or two sentences.
When you speak this is OK. But when you want someone to have a quick overview
of the essentials, then you need to organise your post…

Having headers that are made bold and italic, helps a lot too. 
If you have problems with "too many characters, or distortions of your text",
cut the text and paste it in the "clipboard button" of your menu bar above the
text window.
Also please do not use abbreviations. It makes text very unfriendly to read.

From now on, when I find a post that needs too much of my attention I will link
an example of how to do it in a way that makes things easier on us (mind this
is not about the content of the case presentation, it might still miss some
essential information for example, but it is meant to give an idea of how to
present it).
The request is that you personally edit your post so I can send it through to
Johan.

Please understand that it is not so much that I mind editing your posts, but
more that time is an issue. There's pressure for me to focus on other things
too...

Thank you so much!

    Hi Karolina,

    I can appreciate how much time it takes and thanks to both you and Johan
    for doing this.
    I am a bit unclear on exactly the format you would like.
    Do you have a favorite example already on the forum of the way you want
    cases presented?
     
    All the Best,

    Thank you Dennis,

    This post (LINK) of you I have already edited. If you compare it to the way
    it was, you can maybe see the difference. Your posts are generally easy to
    edit. Thank you for that!

    Some general outlines:

    * All general information about your client at the top.

    * Clear headers that separate topics.

    * The right information in the right place, short and not too much extra
    information. See example below...

    * Don't use abbreviations for the meridians and remedies, or for anything
    else.

    * When listing the drops put an R or L directly behind the meridian,
    because then you don't have to glance back at the header "right/left hand/
    foot". It makes it easier when you read to find whether a certain meridian
    that we expect to drop did or not.

    * Also for most meridians it is enough to know how many points were
    dropping, only specific points like appendix, meninges, the separate
    hormone and lymphatic glands should be mentioned by name. It is surprising
    that some people just mention "3 drops on the Triple Warmer". This is not
    enough information to work with.

    * The best way to put the remedies in your case report is right behind the
    drops they corrected and then to emphasise them by making them bold.
    It would be very helpful to "bold" remedies that were actually measured…

    * When the remedies are not put behind the meridians it does not make sense
    to put them under each other. You can just sum them up behind each other.

    * Make a clear separation between the separate sessions by making the
    header bold.

    * All questions should be at the bottom. Don't put many questions in one
    sentence, and make the questions short an concise.


    Again… what seems to be the biggest problem by far is to organise
    information into the specific topics and to be concise...

    Example:
    If you would create a text like.

    "my client, who is a very good friend of me, has been healthy all her life,
    but now after having had this fever can't get well anymore. She is getting
    pretty desperate….. has all these aches and pains all over her body and
     has been in and out of the hospital without any results and is very
    nervous about the future. She has a family she has to take care of, but
    says she can't be "loving" anymore. Whenever her daughter of 3 asks for too
    much attention, she gets these violent outbursts, and then of course feels
    extremely guilty"

    The way to organise this is

    Client:
    ... year old women, good friend of me. Has a family of … children (but only
    if this is relevant).

    Symptoms:
    Aches and pains => all over her body (aches and pains being the topic you
    want to attract attention too!)
    Desperation
    Can't be "loving" anymore
    Violent outbursts => e.g. when her daughter asks too much of her =>
    followed by guilt
    Worries about the future => also about her family she has to take care of

    History:
    Healthy all her life => Fever in 2011 => depression + aches and pains
    Been in and out of the hospital => without diagnosis or results 


    Thank you for joining me in the effort to make this work ;-)

Cleaning the Cup?

Has anyone ever taken the glass out of the cup and cleaned it.  If so how did

    Hi Jan

    I think you might use the footplate as a cup, as it is impossible to

    normal.

    Most of the ones I have seen have the plastic cup with a seperate glass

    in the bottom of the cup?

    All cups are supposed to have a round glass plate at the bottom. In the
    older cups the black connection would get loose and then you could take the
    glass out, but the newer ones are solid and I don't know of a way to clean
    underneath. I'm just very careful in keeping it clean…

    This is very strange! The black connector is shaped around the small round

    The cup is solid white plastic all around (the bottom is also white), but
    it has a small round glass plate on the bottom. Can you take a closer look?
    It might be that you just never studied it well enough to notice...

    Well, good news, I cleaned it out with pure water, there is enough of a
    space under the glass for the water to get in there and wash away the
    powder. Then it to took a day and a half out in the sun for the water and
    condensation to be completely gone from under the glass plea. Looks good as
    new!

Anorexia?

EsterReitsma
November 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Hello everybody, I am new to the forum and read a lot of the posts which helped
me verry much. Thank you all for that. But....today i saw a new client and I
could use some help on this one.

Medical Diagnosis:
Bloodtest showed her vitamins and minerals where way too low. Especially
vitamin B12. 

Medication:
Ritalin 3 times a day for anxiety.

Lifestyle:
She says she eats normal and healthy, but she is extremely skinny. Doesnt drink
soda.  

Measurement:
Spin Inversion (ran program with fresh blood)

Lymphatic System (L) - all points 
Large intestine (L) - 2 proximal points 
Nervous System (L) - all points 
Hormonal System (L) - all points 
Circulation (L) - 2 proximal points 

Lungs (R) - all points 
Small Intestine (R) - 2 proximal points 
Heart (R) - 2 proximal points 
Hormonal System (R) - Pineal Gland 
Veins (R) - 2 proximal points 
Circulation (R) - 2 proximal points 
Large intestine (R) - 2 proximal points 

Spleen 
Liver (L) 
Kidneys (L) 
Galbladder (L)
Stomach (L)

Bladder (R)
Kidneys (R)
Galbladder (R)

Comment:
In her case I expected more drops on her Intestines....I still checked for
Appendicitis (acute, chronic, necroticans) but they didnt match. 

>12 yrs Program: 
Anti Tetanus, Poliomyelitis, Calculi Renales, Calculi Billiaris, Botulism,
Brucellosis, Tuberculinum and Staphylococcen. 

Cleared all points except for one point on the Circulation (L) => Aesculus
fitted there.

Foot Plates:
Reneel, Atropinum, Selenium, Viscum, Thalamus, Cerebrum, Berberis and
Aesculus. 
 
Question:
I got a little bit the feeling that she could have anorexia.... I read on the
Forum that Karolina has experience with treating clients with anorexia. 
Could you please give me some information about that? Thank you verry much!

    Ritalin creates a lack of hunger!

    Remember to clear Circulation after the Triple Warmer!

    Why do you use Viscum, Thalamus, Cerebrum, on footplates? and no support
    for Kidneys?

    Do all points drop on both feet?

    Hi Ester,

    Anorexia (lack of appetite + extreme weight loss) is a symptom, that can be
    caused by many things.

    But probably you are referring to Anorexia Nervosa... which you should not
    readily assume with the limited information available.
    To know whether your client has an emotional eating disorder you need more
    information.

    For now we only know the symptoms you have given and the measurements and
    remedies that you have found...
    Some alternative possibilities:
    * Tuberculinum - there might be actual TB, which will have all the same
    symptoms your client has including the extreme weight loss.
    * There might also be Intestinal Parasites, which also will give these
    symptoms
    * Cancer... many serious diseases cause extreme weight loss...
    * Chronic Food Borne Infections can also be causal.
    * There can also be a Thyroid issue (overactive) => when the Pineal is out
    of order, which the measurements show, the Thyroid usually is too... and
    since you did not measure a drop on the Thyroid, you might have overlooked
    an imbalance in this organ completely. Maybe there even is a Whiplash...
    something to check for next time.

    Anyway... what is known is that in any form of Anorexia, appetite will
    return when the Gallbladder/Liver system is balanced completely again. 

    When there is indeed Anorexia Nervosa. Treating the Gallbladder/Liver until
    balanced is usually the main thing to do.

    Peter: Don't forget the Kidneys are second in importance after the Hormonal
    System. Then the Circulation...
   
    I am also interested in the drops on the feet.

    Hello Karolina! Thank you very much for your quick response and your
    helpfull insights! I know i shouldn't judge a client that easy but when we
    were talking about her symptoms and problems something gave me the idea
    that i had to look in this direction.... I had 2 friends with anorexia
    nervosa and it felt very much the same. But ofcouse i certainly have to
    know more before I even consider to mention this to her :). 

    Question:
    1. In the case of cancer wouldn't it be likely that her organs would have
    shown drops? 
    2. Her Thyroid did drop... Sorry for the mistake in the first post... But
    with Anti-Tetanus and Poliomyelitis it was balanced...should I still have
    treated the Whiplash in this case?

    For the points on the feet: Spleen - all points Liver (L) - 2 proximal
    Stomach (L) - 2 lower Galbladder (L) - proximal Kidneys (L) - all Liver (R)
    - all Stomach(R) - also 2 lower but i am not exactly sure on that anymore
    Galbladder (R) - 2 proximal Kidneys (R) - all Bladder (R) - 2 middle points
    Thank you again for your answer. I will see her again in a week.

    It is good to keep in mind that Anorexia is a symptom, even when it started
    with eating irregular, not eating, skipping meals... Now there is an
    imbalance of the body that doesn't allow her to return to her normal eating
    habits. 
    With so many drops, and especially on the Liver! you need to focus on
    restoring her digestive system. Her hunger will naturally return.

    Answers:
    1. What do you mean by this? There were many organs dropping.... 
   
    2. Before you start measuring for remedies, when the Thyroid and
    Para-Thyroid both drop, the measurement protocol tells you to treat for
    Whiplash first. So you should have done this before testing Poliomyelitis
    and Anti-Tetanus.

    EsterReitsma
    November 2013 edited November 2013 Flag
    1. Sorry for being unclear on this. I meant with no drops on her Organ
    Degeneration points. 
    2. Yes, you are right. Don't know why I missed that but it won't happen
    again :).
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    November 2013 Flag
    OK.. thank you ;-) 

    It is not always so that you'll see drops on the Organ Degeneration
    meridian when there's cancer. There's always the possibility of the body
    not showing everything that is going on (masking/layers).
    And on the other hand when there are drops on this meridian, which is very
    common, especially in the first couple of sessions, this doesn't mean
    there's cancer.

    Only when both Organ Degeneration and a specific organ system both react on
    a Cancer Nosode you have an indication that there might be cancer (no
    definite diagnosis possible!).
    For example: Organ Degeneration and Uterus are both corrected by Carcinoma
    Uteri..

    I am still testing what the difference is between measuring a client in our
    home with and in home of the client without a memoniser. A lot of factors
    playing a role so I am not able to answer your question (yet). Maybe you
    can start testing aswell. And gather information too. Succes and kind

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Q&A Flag
Question
What is a reasonable time to expect answers on a case on the forum, in case of
next appointment with a client?

Answer
We try to answer all questions within a week. However, whenever there is an
extensive question that also needs restructuring before I have a proper
overview, it may take a bit longer. There may be short periods of absence from
the forum when for example we are on an expo or are reviewing case-studies for
certification. But usually all questions are answered within a week. 

Note: We may sometimes overlook a posting. So if your question takes very long
to get an answer, please notify us by placing a comment under it. This way it
will rise to the top of the list and catch our attention.

    About the medical diagnoses:
    81 (or 4.5 european value) does not indicate hypoglycaemia. It is actually
    a healthy value. Also to diagnose hypoglycaemia or diabetes properly, an
    extended glucose tolerance test needs to be done, and that is not general
    practice anymore.

    Triglyceride levels are normal too.

    TSH does not indicate the Thyroid function directly, since it is produced
    by the Pituitary gland. But also 1.09 is well within the normal range.

    The white blood cell count (WBC) is slightly lowered, which can be caused
    by several things including (chronic) stress! A history of abuse usually
    causes hypervigilance = stress.

    This shows that it is always important to stay objective and not just to
    copy a diagnosis that a client has received

    Comments on Assessment/Treatment:
    * You missed the indication for Whiplash! Both Thyroid and Parathyroid were
    dropping so you should have given a Whiplash treatment along with the Spin
    Inversion Treatment.
   
    * The Hormone System is the first meridian to completely balance before
    working on other meridians. 
   
    * Calculi Renales (Kidney Stones) is not a causative factor for hyper
    insulin. You left the Adrenal Cortex point unbalanced, but usually when you
    balance it the Hyper Insulin point will follow automatically…
   
    * You also left the Thyroid untreated the first Hand Treatment. Probably
    the Thyroid would have been balanced after the Whiplash treatment. She had
    a car accident...
   
    * Treating with the Calculi remedies before the Parathyroid is balanced in
    the first measurement (before treatments) is not very useful. First the
    causative factor (=Parathyroid imbalance) needs to be solved.
   
    * The points you indicate as Aura points (on the Small Intestine and Large
    Intestine), usually are easily balanced with Food Poisoning Nosodes (often
    Leptospirose or Listeriose). Only when they drop very steeply, which
    indicates an energetic disturbance you could think of an energetic hole or
    weakness at the level of the Solar Plexus. These are not specific Aura
    points though. When there's a true lack of Aura almost all points drop
    steeply! 
   
    * Support remedies are necessary for the issues you address with the
    nosodes. It makes, for example, sense to use remedies that support the
    healing of infections/inflammations, mucosa and lymphatic system when you
    find Appendicitis Necroticans. 
   
    * When you treat Gallstones or Kidney stones it is important to use a
    support that relaxes the (smooth) muscles so you limit the chances of
    getting colics when the body tries to expel the stones (this has
    happened!). Atropinum is a good choice. Also Chelidonium is a smart remedy
    to use as support when there are Gallstones.
   
    Answer to your question:
    When there are so many drops on the Intestines, for sure Appendicitis
    Necroticans comes to mind. And since Appendicitis can also affect the
    Hormone System, it is a remedy that you can also try when working on that
    meridian. Remember the Hormone System always is first focus! If
    Appendicitis is a remedy that matches there and also corrects other systems
    that is of course very good…. the less remedies you need to use, the
    better.
   
    About this specific case:

    Possible Causes for your Client's Symptoms: 
    Circulation => Ovarian/Sinus Cysts, coldness, cold extremities (can also
    be cramping = Gallbladder), muscle soreness
    Mucosal Inflammation (often Appendicitis, Tonsillitis and Food Poisonings)
    => Food/environmental sensitivities, chronic sinus infections, memory
    problems (intestinal flora imbalance)
    Gallbladder/Liver => Anxiety, muscle weakness, memory problems,
    cold extremities
    Adrenals => are of course also very important as they provide energy to all
    functions of the body and give resistance to life's stresses. They are
    often exhausted in people who are traumatised and have lived with abuse.
    However the Adrenals can only replenish after the Gallbladder system starts
    to relax a bit. Abuse and trauma can cause a lifelong hypervigilant state
    which is very stressful. 
   
    I would also like to know if she is on any medication right now.

    June 2014 edited June 2014 Flag
    Thanks for your personal response. No she is not on any medications.
    These ranges are based on Functional Medical analysis not conventional
    analysis and are considered trends not classical diagnosis. That is the
    reason why I referred to them as 'Functional'.

    I did do a Whiplash treatment I simply forgot to enter it. I think I was so
    excited about writing my first client's report I was quiet sloppy. I will
    look over your comments I thought of some of the issues you brought. Like
    why didn't one of the whiplash points resolve. I also realized that there
    was something wrong with the sequence in the choice of remedies and points.
    I will study your response well.  And lastly, my measuring technique, needs
    improving, for sure....
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    June 2014 edited June 2014 Flag
    I did understand that you were referring to another diagnostic system, but
    still the same comments apply: 

    * Without an 8 hour glucose tolerance test one cannot truly diagnose a
    functional sugar balance issue. This blood was collected at one moment in
    time and does not tell you how the body functions in response to glucose at
    all.

    * TSH only tells you something about a Pituitary response not about the
    Thyroid function directly. So since the Pituitary was imbalanced anyway, as
    it is in everyone who received a Polio shot, this tells you nothing.

    * Values that are commonly used in the current medical model are averages,
    just like the values of any other system that one can come up with. They
    are never individualized. 

    * Healthy chemical functioning of the body follows healthy energetic
    functioning of the body. 
    Biontology is working on a level above the chemical, and so we do not look
    at chemical values in our assessment and treatment procedure. 

    * Exposure to certain chemicals that are not produced by our own bodies IS
    however important, but that is a whole different thing.

    Sometimes the Whiplash treatment needs to be done several times to restore
    the neck area (try 2-3 times next session), but there can also be another
    cause for the Thyroid and the Parathyroid to drop together. Since you also
    measured Appendicitis Necroticans, there could also be Chronic Tonsillitis
    which can disturb the neck glands too. But there are several other possible
    causes (see the measurement protocol!)

    I know it is a lot of information I am giving you, especially since you
    have just started, but by being complete I hope to assist you the best I
    can in quickly mastering Biontology.

    Questions:
    1. Are you suggesting to test the Adrenal Cortex before the insulin point?
      
    Is there a preferred sequence of point balancing that is better than simply
    following the 'line' from Pituitary to Adrenals?

    2.  In the protocol for Insulin it says if you don't succeed with Selenium
    then look at the Gall Bladder remedies, which I did and it seemed to
    balance with the Calculi Renales, so I guess you are suggesting that my
    measurement was incorrect, that is, my technique?

    3. Concerning the Adrenals and the Gall Bladder, are you suggesting a link
    in these two via the choice of remedy or are you saying one should balance
    the Gall Bladder with the Adrenals..?  

    4. If after one Whiplash treatment and one of the points, Thyroid or
    ParaThyroid, does not balance do you suggest moving on or doing the
    Whiplash again until at least one responds.? 
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    June 2014 edited June 2014 Flag
    Answers:
    1. Unfortunately there is no way we can make a protocol with an exact order
    of balancing points, since usually when you measure remedies that carry
    information similar or the same as a Cause, they fix many points at the
    same time. This is why every point needs to be measured first so you get an
    overview of the body's condition, and you can start to see the
    correlations. It is experience that tells you that balancing the Adrenals
    usually balances the Hypoglycemic (Hyper Insulin!) point too.

    2. Calculi Renales is not a Gallbladder remedy. It is the information of
    Kidney Stones, but when someone has gallstones this remedy, as a support,
    can be used along with Calculi Billi, which is the remedy with the
    information of gallstones.
    If you use them before the Parathyroid is balanced in your first
    measurement of a session, the Calculis only take up space (and it is a
    waste of energy for the body to work on them)
    Gallbladder remedies that might match for the Hypo-Insulin point are
    Billiary Cirrhosis and Cholecystitis. But sometimes there are Food
    Poisonings too that affect the Gallbladder. Vaccinations can be a
    disturbance for all Hormonal points...

    3. When the Gallbladder is out of balance people are usually very tensed,
    are not able to relax, have restless sleep, do more than they can afford
    for their body's condition, and feel it is impossible to go inward and, for
    example, meditate… Telling people they should rest is usually not going to
    help. So when the Gallbladder system is balanced it is easier to rest and
    recover from adrenal fatigue.

    4. When you measure Whiplash in the first session and treat it, usually
    only the Thyroid will be balanced since almost everyone has received a
    Tetanus vaccination or and Anti-Tetanus shot somewhere in their life, and
    this will always disturb the Parathyroid.
    In some severe cases a Whiplash can take up to 3 Whiplash treatments to be
    corrected. But if then both points still drop there is another cause. It
    can be Vaccinations/Childhood diseases, or Tonsillitis, Jaw/Dental problems
    or Metal in the mouth/neck area…

    Calculi Renales is a remedy that sometimes matches the gallstone point on

    shown up as a remedy that works on the Insulin Points…

    Next Session, June 25, '14:  
   
    Added info: 
    Vaccines received: Hep B, Polio, Tetanus, DPT
    Client has gotten a clerical job at a hospital
   
    Symptoms after last session:
    More relaxed, 
    Improved sleep, 
    Less sugar drops 
    Lack of depression
    Sensation of 'light surrounding her' 
    Last night, though she slept poorly due to neighbour's noise
   
    1st measurement:
    So many drop that I decided to run a Circulation pre-treatment, suggested
    in class.

    Pituitary - Poliomyelitis (again)
    Parathyroid - Diphtheria
    Large Intestine - Appendicitis Necroticans
    Thymus - Mumps
    Insulin - Cholecystitis
    Adrenal Cortex - Berberis
    Small Intestine - Brucellosis
    Small Intestine - Klebsiella Pneumonia (Odd in this position ?)

    2nd measurement:  
    Large Intestine OK, 
    Hormones OK on Left hand

    Foot Plate:
    Barijoheel, Injeel Chol, Atropinum, Apis, Placenta, Selenium, Solidago,
    Reneel 


    Note to previous treatment: 
    I felt that the Aura points did drop fast.  

    I also want to make clear that I did not accept the Funtional Medicine
    diagnosis as a Conventional Diagnosis. I do think she is hypoglycemic based
    on her subjected complaints, though.  The use of functional medical
    analysis is an aid in determining the trends since lab reports are a
    "momentary shot" of an ongoing, living organism.

    Hi Stefano,

    There are two things that got mixed up:

    1. The pre-treatment, that I recommend to beginning students (so just to
    make it absolutely clear, this is not part of the protocol for advanced
    practitioners!), is to eliminate the more superficial disturbances, so you
    have less drops to work with. When you just start your training, all
    information is so overwhelming that I always provide students with this
    suggestion. This treatment is a 2-7 years standard program without remedies
    .

    2. A short program with Circulation remedies is only done when you are not
    able to get valid measurements due to bad circulation. Whenever you use
    remedies before your assessment with nosodes, you will mask a lot of
    relevant information, so this is only done when there is absolutely no
    other way.

    Question:
    What do you mean by: "Hormones OK on Left hand"? I hope there were no drops
    on the right hand?

    A "momentary shot" is never a reliable indication of how the body functions
    in time. I regard blood values as not useful, they are very deceptive. V
    arious medical systems have different values, but you need to put them ALL
    aside in Biontology. Everything you need to know will show in your
    measurements of the values of the points. 
    The Chiren measurements, when done correctly, indicate very accurately what
    systems in the body are functioning correctly.
    Functional Medicine does not say anything about the functioning of the
    body, I have looked into functional medicine in the 90's and did not find
    any use for it in Biontology. It did not match at all with my findings.

    Hello, thanks for the clarification on the pre treatment. 

    Concerning the Hormone fingers, the left hand was resolved after
    treatment.  The right had did not have drops.  

    I totally get the 'momentary shot' thing.  I will gladly put these
    'conventional and alternative values aside'.  It will take time to 'stop'
    thinking that way, but I'm easy. 
    I already am amazed at the power of the Chiren, even with the little I know
    of it.

    That is good to know. I already thought you did mean the complete Hormone
    System was corrected, but since you specifically mentioned the left hand I
    needed to verify. It is crucial to correct the complete Hormone System
    first, but I'm sure you get that by now ;-)

    At this point, the question arises, do we value the 'improved' lab markers
    that are 'caused' as a result of the Chiren sessions.  Can we feel
    comfortable with improved HgA1c, hemocysteine, PSA, Ca25, etc.  How exactly
    do we see these values?

    (can you suggest a remedy for feeling guilty for asking so many question?)
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    June 2014 edited June 2014 Flag
    If clients and their doctors value these markers, then they can look at
    them and monitor how they change. To me they have little relevance. How do
    we know if the values have changed because of a Chiren session or if they
    would have "improved" anyway? Blood values fluctuate all the time and often
    get assigned a meaning that is incomplete or even wrong. 

    In Biontology we only look at the energetic/informational functioning of
    the body, and the resulting changes in symptoms. 
    When a tumor disappears this is more relevant than seeing a "tumor marker"
    disappear from the blood. When someone doesn't have sugar cravings anymore,
    this is more relevant than when a momentary blood sugar value falls within
    a certain range…

    Often people use drugs to keep certain "values" in check, but don't
    experience any improvement in symptoms, or worse: they get more symptoms…


    "(can you suggest a remedy for feeling guilty for asking so many question?)
    "

    You should never feel guilty about asking questions! As long as you don't
    understand something you need to ask questions. Asking questions is crucial
    in learning and mastering a subject. I still think many students ask far
    too few questions. Active learning and researching means wondering about
    things. Every time you see a new client you have to ask questions, but you
    need to know what questions you need to ask. This is the reason why I
    emphasise to present a case in a certain way and it is also the reason for
    why I often answer a question with another question. Often the question IS
    the answer. The question is what one should have asked during the
    particular session…

    So thank you for participating and asking so many questions. It shows a lot
    of strength and wisdom. And remember that there is no judgement in any of
    the corrections we make. We just try to keep this forum in line with the
    Biontology protocols so everyone who wants to learn Biontology will have
    the opportunity to really understand it.

Instructions for Brass Rods

Cyoung
September 2014 edited September 2014 in Other Therapies & Instruments Flag
Wanted to confirm some information about the brass rods IABS sells:

1. How to install the rods in a workspace? To protect a home?

2. Do they provide unidirectional protection only or along several axes?

3. What do they protect against (radar, microwaves, cellphones and WiFi, dirty
electricity) ?

    I also wanted to know if it's effective if you encircle a device, like a
    smart meter.  Also, Johan, have you written anyting on the rods....an
    article of something. 
  •

    Candace:
    1. there are 6 rods, 3 short ones and three long. They should be placed
    L-S-L-S-L-S in a square or rectangle so they form a field.

    They can be placed making a horizontal or a vertical field. The distance
    between two rods must be at least 7 feet.

    You can place them around a house to protect the house from disturbances
    from beneath. If you want to protect the house from radiation, you need to
    install a vertical field along the side of the house( the side from where
    the radiation is coming from).

    2. This means they offer protection from radiation by the field they
    create. The rods form a field between them.

    3. They protect against all of the above, not in quantity but in quality.
    This means there is no measurable change within the field, but the
    influence of the EMF on our system lessens.

    Stefano:
    One can encircle a smart meter but the distance between the rods must be 7
    feet. So it is better to create a field between the smart meter and your
    house.

    I have never written anything about the rods.

    Candace:
    The orientation of the rods is not so important. Some can be vertically
    positioned, others horizontally.
    Whether you use 4 or 6 rods depends on the size of the space.
    The rods need to be at least 7 feet apart from each other.

    From these responses I am still not sure if I can install 2 configurations
    of 4 or 6 in a room if both a floor and a wall need protection from EMR?
    The two planes are in contact with one another. Will this cancel out or

    My local school district is asking for detailed, scientific information
    about the brass rods before they give approval to use them in kindergarten
    classrooms. I remember Johan stated there were no studies in writing. 

    1. Would it be possible for the Health Angel Organization or Johan to
    create a standard statement about these rods for these type of inquiries,
    including a disclaimer, if necessary?
    2. If they eventually approve use in the district, is there a way for the
    district to purchase them directly from Health Angel Organization or would
    they only be supplied through practitioners?
    3. Is it alright to have the public replicate these rods on their own or
    would you prefer they purchase only through this organization?

    Thanks. This development has taken me seven months to negotiate. Hoping
    they accept these as some form of protection from WiFi antennae and routers

    I've been experimenting with brass rods made according to instructions
    posted here.

    Elements of Investigation:
    * Applying the rods in different settings
    * Observation of changes in terms of body sensations and experience

    Left out of the Investigation:
    * Chiren measurement after exposure => because there may be too many other
    factors influencing any possible reading

    Recent Experiment:
    Small 4x4m room
    4 rods in every corner of the room (ceiling and floor)
    Observation bodily sensations => most distinct sensations on the floor
    plane, while lying on a thin mattress

    I wonder if such direct field contact OR rod proximity experimentation is
    beneficial for wellbeing long term. Any insight is most welcome. 

    Questions
    1. Is there any significance to the distance of the brass rods/field from
    the physical body?

    2. Would it be alright to spend time very close (say 50 cm) to the
    periphery of the field, or to the actual rods themselves? Inside or outside
    the field?

    3. I have also tested the rods in a small (4x4m) room, by positioning 4
    rods in each corner of the room both on the ceiling and on the floor, while
    L-S alternating. Because this room is not too large could I also do with
    only 2 rods on ceiling corners?

    4. Do you agree that measurement after exposure does not give a good
    assessment of the effect of the field because possible other influences?

    This may perhaps be of interest to others applying brass rods for their
    individual purposes too...
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    November 2015 edited November 2015 Flag
    Answer
    1. Not likely

    2. The field consists of a beneficial frequency. There is no difference in
    the center or the periphery.

    3. With only 4 rods your room is not completely covered by the field, there
    are various blind spots.​ 6 rods is far better but you cannot use 6 rods in
    a small room...

    4. I do not agree. You can easily assess the effect of exposure to the
    field (or another influence).
    For this you need to research by measuring before you expose yourself to a
    changing environment and after again. Also short exposure and long term
    exposure you could research.

Remote Session with Spin Inversion

My client is out of the country and appears to have Spin Inversion symptoms.

My understanding is that if I run the Spin Inversion program 3 times with the

Question:
1. What do I do with the hand rods? 
2. Is there a method to treat the client remotely to actually measure and not
assume the client is in Spin? 

Thank you

    The method of the picture in the cup (with spiral) could work, but only
    when you then have another picture between the footplates. The picture in
    the cup is the replacement for the blood…. and then the corrected spin
    information needs to be given to the client through the footplates.

    Answers:
    1. With this procedure you need to put a picture between the footplates for
    treatment
    2. You can surrogate measure on yourself, but both Johan and I do not
    prefer this as you connect your energy system to that of the surrogate.
    In radionics this is common practice and when Johan was researching this he
    found that many practitioners developed pancreatic cancer by doing this.

    The above suggestion to try with a picture in the cup and a picture between

    don't know if this works at all.

EMF Brass Rods

Barbaralee
February 2014 edited February 2014 in Questions for the H.A.A. Flag
Diane directs me to ask questions regarding the brass rods and EMF on the
forum.

1) Is there any resource/research supporting their effectiveness?
2) How much do they cost?
3) Do they sell them at IABS
4) Can we use any brass rods? I see on the map she attached the design layout
for distance and short or long rod. Can I go buy rods at the hardware store
certain lengths etc?

Is there a measuring device that I can/should purchase so that I can tell if
the rods actually make a difference?

My daughter Lauren is newly pregnant and I want to reduce the WIFI coming from
other buildings into our home. So I would appreciate detail responses to these
questions if possible? I've looked on other EMF sites and haven't found
anything about brass rods. I did find something about radiant barriers made
from aluminum.

But wondered about the safety of using aluminum on the wall as it's intended to
go inside the walls.

    PS: I found EMF devices (paint, netting, etc.,) on Klinghardt's website.
    Very expensive. I also found the brass rods not under "store" on the
    biontology website, but under practitioners.

    Still, has anyone used the rods and do they have scientific proof of their
    effectiveness. If they really do work, that would be wonderful as
    Kinghardt's don't seem all that practical. Although the netting around the
    bed/crib might be helpful.

    Also, I do know about turning everything off electrical and only using
    landlines etc., in the home. But I'm moving into a large apartment complex
    and the wifi from all the neighbors just come right through the walls.

    1) Official research has not been done, we only have the reports from
    people who have tried them for numerous purposes. The rods create a
    harmonious field.

    2) you have to ask IABS for the price.

    3) They sell them at IABS

    4) The rods must have special lengths. You can buy these rods anywhere and
    have them cut to the specific lengths. But they need to be cut very
    precise.

    5) The effect is on quality, the measurement devices only work with
    quantity.

    There is a kind of aluminium mash that you can put on the windows to
    minimise penetration of wifi through the windows.

    For the rest I do not know anything about aluminium barriers.

    Thank you for responding. A nice meal and a glass of wine can create a

    Very interesting point regarding quality vs. quantity of EMF. Does this
    mean radio frequencies are a mild quality so not harmful, whereas a little
    bit of cellphone right up to one's ear can be very harmful due to the
    quality?

    Harmonious field means a field of of pure light that harmonises everything
    that is in it. 

    The quality changes of the radiation causes it to not affect you anymore.
    But there is still reception, so the radiation itself is not gone.

    A little bit about EMF:
    Certain radiation is dangerous if:

    a) The intensity is too high (Nerves burn through)
    b) The object is close. intensity diminishes with distance and also
    diminishes when the direction of the signal is diverted away from the
    target.
    c) It is broadcasted at our physical antenna's (Nerves) that can receive
    these signals.
    d) Radiation disturbs the cell membranes as is the case of microwave or
    cell phone radiation.
     

    In cellphones...
    a) The intensity is very high, 
    b) The direction is towards the head, the distance is very small
    c) There always is a low frequency added. This low frequency is exactly at
    33 Hz, one of the frequency of the normal brain waves. This frequency is
    not needed for the operation of the cellphone network which is all high
    frequency….

    Question:
    Is there anything available on the market that protects against the added
    33 Hz?

    Maybe there is a way to take that added feature out or neutralise it?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    March 2014 Flag
    Answer:
    Unfortunately there is nothing that can be done about the 33 Hz wave since
    it is a wave that belongs in the body, but if the intensity is big the
    nerves in the head, that are tuned to this frequency, can burn through.

    The strange thing is that there is no obvious reason for this low frequency
    wave to be added to the high frequency cell phone waves.

    What I suspect is that other information is modulated on top of this wave
    that goes directly into the brain and influences you subconsciously, a type
    of brain washing might be going on…..

    Questions
    1. Will the brass rods trap the wifi and cell phone radiation inside a room
    or house when it otherwise might go on through it? 

    2.  If the brass rods are installed outside a home, what is the height of
    the protection?  For instance if someone is laying in their bed, which may
    be several feet above the level of the brass rods (depending on the height
    of the homes foundation), are they still protected?

    3. Many homes here have a maze of hard rock gold mining tunnels going as
    far down as 3,000 feet underneath them.  Do the brass rods help with those
    ley lines and geopathic stress?  Would cork or sheepskin, under a bed that
    has no metal springs in it, also protect from geopathic stress since it is
    essentially a magnetic field coming from the earth?

  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    March 2014 Flag
    Answers:
    1. The brass rods will stop the effects of radiation and magnetic fields on
    the body. As far as measurements of the strength of the fields indicate,
    they do not appear to reduce the strength of the fields. So it is a
    qualitative effect.
    The rods are tuned to the harmonic of pure light because of their very
    precise length.
    So the waves will pass through this filter of light and thereby change the
    quality.

    2. If the rods are placed into the ground around a building, they will form
    a horizontal field, protecting the house from anything that comes from
    below.
    The field of influence of the rods is on one plane, either horizontal or
    vertical.
    If there is a need to protect for example a side wall or a window, rods
    need to be placed on the four corners of that surface.

    3. Yes

    I have recently discovered an issue with EMF's in my office.
    My office is on the ground level with no offices above but adjacent.  
    I have a Triaxial ELF(Extremely Low Frequency) Magnetic Field meter which
    is showing a rise in readings near the floor and emanating from one wall
    which has a bathroom on the other side. 
    The floor is concrete with carpet.

    Questions:
     1. I am wondering if placing brass rods which are sold through IABS on the
        four corners of the wall and also placing another four on the corners
        of the floor would help to reduce the effects of the EMF's
     2. I would also like to know if there is a maximum or ideal distance
        between rods that should be observed when placing the rods.
     3. Should they be attached flat on the wall or floor or perpendicular to
        it.?
     4. How should the rods be aligned to each other.  Should they be parallel
        to each other. one placed at each corner of the wall or would having
        them placed on diagonals in the corners be the correct way to do this?
     5. Is using the brass rods the way to deal with this issue or do you have
        any other suggestions

Do you think breaking down the tablets or capsules of supplements in water
would give a more accurate reading for testing the impact?

    From what I understand, this is not advised.  LINK
    If this was done with a supplement of any nature I would suppose it would
    have to follow this process.  I've heard that some try to diagnose the need
    for a supplement, which would be out of protocol.

    Yes, of course. 

    However, sometimes it is helpful for clients to hear how the supplements
    disturb the meridians.

    I'm just wondering if the reading would be more accurate if we dissolved
    the supplement in water first?

    Hmmm, I'm not sure that 'reading' the supplement means that it is
    "disturbing" the meridian.

    Dissolving supplements in water does not alter information in any
    significant way. Tablets do not take information as do fluids.

    The information of the source has to be correct and transferred into a
    medium that can easily receive and hold it.

    An, thanks for the clarification about my confusion.  Some persons say that
    you can measure for supplemental deficiency.  This was my assumption in the
    query.

Correlation Hypo Insulin Point and Gallbladder System

Terry Werner
June 2015 edited June 2015 in General Questions Flag
Questions
1. Why do Gallbladder remedies help clear that point?
2. Could someone explain to me what the relationship is between the Gallbladder
system and the Hypo Insulin point.

    Answers:
    1. & 2. Just as with all aspects of Biontology, this finding is mostly
    based on experience. The Hypo Insulin (=Diabetes) Point only reacts to
    Gallbladder remedies. I have never found anything else that works on this
    point. The explanation followed later...

    The above correlation does make a lot of sense according to the Chinese
    Five Element System.
    Diabetes is caused the Wood (Gallbladder) element destroying the Earth
    (Pancreas) element. 
    Thus diabetes is a problem that is caused by the Gallbladder system, but is
    expressed through Pancreas problems. It also explains why stress has such a
    huge impact on Diabetes.

    That does make sense according to the 5 element theory.  Thank you for your
    explaination

    If one places the Insulin point (Diabetes) in the category of Fire as the
    Triple Warmer is in Five Elements then we can see the cause to be an
    emotional imbalance (Fire/Heart/Small Intestine/Pericardium/Triple Warmer)
    which instigates over eating of fats, sweets and rich foods.  This results
    in a taxation on the Spleen/Pancreas, weakening the Earth, draining further
    the Fire and the Wood - this can be seen in relationship to the hormonal
    taxation of the pancreas and the liver, respectively. The fact that
    Gallbladder remedies work on the hormonal point of the Triple Warmer, in my
    opinion, relates to the strengthening the Wood to feed the Fire.  Another
    way of looking at this is in the treatment of Diabetes in Chinese
    medicine.  When diabetes is in full force the Chinese diagnosis is Kidney
    yin deficiency and Earth weakness which then is worsened by the Liver heat
    acting on the Earth, further weakening the Earth.  The symptoms of diabetes
    are high thirst (kidney yin deficient, high hunger (earth yin deficient)
    and increased urination (failure to hold the yin).  In conclusion, in
    seeing the Triple Warmer point of the right hand/Insulin as Fire the five
    elements makes sense, so the issue fits the model of Five Elements.

    Thank you Stefano, but the Biontology perspective/experience is slightly
    different.

    In the Biontology use of the five element system the Circulation and
    Hormone System do not participate as one element, but are connected to all
    elements. This is why in our system the Hormone System and Circulation are
    drawn as a circle outside of the elements. 

    The Chinese also do not recognise the Triple Warmer as being the Hormone
    System, this was discovered by Voll. 
  • 
    SVitale
    July 2015 Flag
    Thanks, the way I understand the Triple Warmer is that it is the connecting
    system of the upper, middle and lower parts of the body.  This connects all
    the elements, Further, the whole meridian system is based on connection. 
    The command points integrate the five elements in each element.  My point
    is that if you do look at the Circulation and the Triple Warmer as Fire you
    do see the five element relationship happening, at least I do.  Fire is the
    discriminating element in the Chinese five element scheme, This is the
    'mind' as shen or heart.  Of course, my education was Taoist not TCM.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    July 2015 edited July 2015 Flag
    Yes I was educated in the five elements according to TCM, but as far as
    successful practice of Biontology goes it is best to have a completely
    fresh look and keep it clean and simple.

    The Hormone System is not just Fire, other archetypes match too and these
    can explain observations in practice better. 
     For example: Adrenals/Sex Glands can be correlated with Water too, Insulin
    glands with Earth, Thyroid with Wood, Pituitary with Fire... You can play
    with that, but ultimately in treatment it is mostly a matter of observation
    what works practically and effectively in Biontology. Mostly the five
    elements are used to explain things after the fact... The protocol is the
    main guideline on how to work.
  • 
    SVitale
    July 2015 Flag
    I do see your point, which, I think confirms my point.  Your examples of
    Adrenal=water etc are the way the Triple Warmer relates the hormones to the
    elements, via the pituitary.  I see it akin to the command points of each
    meridian which are points that possess an element, so as you know the Metal
    meridian have five points on it that are of each element.  I see the Triple
    Warmer in Voll scheme to be a microcirculation aspect of the body's
    system.  I'll try to come back to this from time to time to see if my point
    continues to make sense to me...I don't see any reason to exclude the
    Circulation/Hormone system from the five elements, it seems to work when I
    compute the scheme.

Biontology Manual & Chiren User Guide - Link to Dropbox

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
February 2015 edited February 2015 in H.A.A. Messages Flag
For anyone who missed or lost the email with the updated manual, you can use
the following link:

Biontology Manual & Chiren User Guide - Dropbox


This is the email that was sent out along with the link to the new manual. I
Include it because it contains some useful information about how to use the
protocols.

Dear Certified Biontologists, Chiren Practitioners and Students,

I am happy to finally present the new Biontology® manual to you. Just like the
Biontology® Remedy Book, the whole process of writing, editing and perfecting
layout proved to be far more labor-intensive than expected, but the result, I
believe, is great.

The Biontology® manual counts over 200 pages, and provides a complete guideline
of the basic principles of Biontology®, the same principles I have used for
decades to treat clients effectively and safely with my instruments, and also
what I have always taught.

The last couple of years, Karolina has helped me to find the right words for,
and create structure in Biontology® teaching. She has done so in a way that I
did not believe was possible. I truly believe that what she has done in this
manual is laying a solid foundation for Biontology® and as I have been
misrepresented often, I'm grateful beyond words and am confident that this will
be a huge step forward for the field of Biontology® as a whole. Hopefully it
will help you to work from a more profound understanding of the Chiren, the
human body and energetic aspects of life.

Biontology® is an integration of many types of knowing, which can be learned,
but requires continuous study, experience and critical observation. In the 30
years that I have been involved in the field of biophotons, humanity has
changed considerably. My basic principles as described in this book have never
changed, but disease patterns certainly have. People and life circumstances
change and we must change with them in order to remain successful.

Because of a pre-release of the measurement-protocol, "working according to
protocol" has been misinterpreted as rigidly following the points and suggested
remedies, but what it really means is integrating all the aspects as described
in this manual. For practitioners who have been reading and studying the forum,
there will not be much new information in there, as all topics were touched
upon at some point. Putting it all in a structured and comprehensive manual
makes the information far more accessible however.

Since it is very hard to present a non-linear process of working in a
chronological list, we chose to make a split between "measurement protocol" and
a "treatment protocol". These two protocols need to be integrated into one
session.

The measurement protocol is the guideline as to what to measure first and what
programs to use when. It is basically a description of what a standard session
looks like.

The treatment protocol helps you to understand what should be your first focus
of treatment according to your measurements/findings and how to make
progression by working in layers instead of chaotically trying to fix it all at
once. The body has a natural order of healing and needs to be approached with
respect for that order. One of the biggest misunderstandings about Biontology
is that all meridians should be without drops at the end of a session. This
will only lead to chaotic treatment, overdosing and severe reactions, slower
results or no result at all. Working in line with the body will increase
effectiveness of the treatments so fewer sessions are necessary for success.

I have seen and heard that after introducing the measurement protocol alone,
the successes of practitioners have increased. A progression that I hope, this
new manual will help continue.

As for the old manual, only the relevant and correct sections have been
included in this new book, and everything else should be discarded.

The file is too big to send it by e-mail, so we have chosen to use Dropbox. If
you click on the link below, you have immediate access to the PDF file of the
new manual.

I hope you will enjoy reading this manual.

Johan Boswinkel

    Hereby the updated manual. 
   
    Biontology Manual & Chiren User Guide 2015 - Dropbox 
   
    There were some mistakes in the hand/foot-meridian charts. Also I have made
    some adaptions in the table of measurement suggestions of the measurement
    protocol to make things more clear. Measuring for calculi for example will
    only make sense when the stone points drop. I have also eliminated support
    remedies from the list except for Arteries/Veins/Adrenals, because this
    should always be a last resort. The preferred choice to remedy meridians is
    nosodes. 
   
    Also the study-route has been adapted to the current situation 2015.

    Measurement protocol + all separate meridian pictures with hand/foot
    points 

    There are also changes in the route to certification, and an outline for
    creating case-studies is added. 

    As IABS is not there anymore, some changes in contact information and
    company names have been made throughout the manual.

    If I were you I would just print the protocol and meridian pictures, and
    just look the case-study outline in the digital document when needed.

Thyroid - Nosodes

    Question
    Can you expand on the nosodes for Thyroid, the manual mention Pertussis,
    Variolinum and Tonsilitis, Can we assume that Lung nosodes and Lymph
    nosodes would also be included.  I am trying to narrow down the nosodes for
    a point like this.  I have a little confusion about this. 
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    October 2015 Flag
    Answer
    I never use nosodes for the Thyroid directly. Even nosodes like Pertussis
    and Variolinum I match on the Pineal gland, then suddenly the Thyroid is
    balanced too. The Pineal gland can disturb the Thyroid.

    The same can happen when the Tonsils (or other Lymphatic points or Hormone
    points) are affected. Normally when you get these disturbing organ systems
    right, the Thyroid comes also into balance.

    So if, for example, the Tonsils are indeed the disturbing factor on the
    Thyroid, you need to find out what disturbs the Tonsils. Possibilities
    are: 

    (Chronic) Tonsillitis
    All 4 Strep and Staph nosodes
    All Food Poisonings
    Measles
    Mumps
    Rubella
    Insecticides
    Dioxin
    Formaldehyde

    If the Tonsils are balanced, but the Thyroid is still dropping, you could
    also try the above nosodes.

    If these nosodes do not match, one can try Strumeel (Iodine metabolism).

    But normally it is another Hormonal gland or Lymph gland that disturbs the
    Thyroid.

Medication:
Vaccines (after birth): BCG and Hep.B
Vaccines (4-week old): DTP, Polio and Meningitis
Ongoing: Losec (proton pump inhibitor for reflux) and Duphalac (for regular
bowel movements) 
On supplemental oxygen, comfort flow 0.5L nasal cannula.

Fully breastfed until admission into hospital 

6 weeks after birth => Admitted to hospital for coffee ground stools,
persistent crying and neck/eye deviated to the left. 

=> Ultra sound: intracranial bleeding = diagnosis late Vitamin K deficiency. 
=> He lost consciousness and spontaneous breathing => put on ventilator => EVD
(drain) => no effect on consciousness and spontaneous breathing 
=> Craniotomy => regained consciousness but spontaneous breathing was only
gradually regained until 27 days later when the ventilator was removed. 
=> Feeding issue = regurgitation of even the smallest amounts of food 
=> Diagnosis choledochal cyst => endoscopic billary drainage 
=> Unable to pass urine or swallow => OG tube and urinary catheter 
=> In between he developed 2 rounds of pneumonia and rotavirus. 
=> Developed crossed eyes and dilated ventricles => ventriculo-peritoneal shunt
was placed but malfunctioned. 
=> Subsequent operation failed to correct the malfunction => suprapubic
catheter was placed. 
=> Choledochal cyst was removed by laparoscopy 
=> Shunt infected(MRSE) and removed. 
=> Suprapubic catheter was removed later. 
=> PEG feeding tube via laparoscopy (navel infection).
=> PEG replaced with MIC-key button. 
=> Ultrasound of brain shows no other damage besides the initial insult to
brain stem & surrounding area. Ventricles are mildly dilated and uniform.

Questions:
I suspect the vaccinations play a part in his conditions. 
I think the squints and muscle problems are due to the Gallbladder and Liver. 
Can Biophoton Therapy help?

    I know one is not supposed to 'react' to these things, but this is
    disgusting! HOW could anyone inject a baby with all those vaccines and not
    know they are causing a potential death drama? If this mother continues the
    medical route (Gee, I thought Canada was different!) - she will definitely
    not have her baby healthy again. Correct? Don't we try to tell everyone not
    to give their babies and children any vaccines - under any circumstances
    whatsoever? When I show people what is in vaccines, they cringe -
    especially knowing that they have had all that in their systems since
    childhood!

    I also think that the symptoms that this baby is suffering from, are due to
    Vaccination Damage.
    I think the main culprit was the Meningitis and Hepatitis Vaccinations.

    The acid reflux gives rise to suspicion that the Gallbladder is
    malfunctioning, possibly due to the Hepatitis Vaccination.

    BCG is a vaccination against TB. TB is an Intestinal problem. It can also
    destroy good Intestinal Bacteria and thus create an imbalance of the
    Intestinal Flora. 

    I think there is a great chance on considerable improvement for this baby
    by treating the causes of the problems. Of course I am wondering how much
    damage has been done by the surgeries.... (structural damage!)

    Thank you all for the guidance. 
    How long must the baby be off the proton pump inhibitor before the
    treatment can be given? And if the mother agrees to go ahead, can I treat
    the symptoms without measuring ? I know we have to measure but the baby is
    wired up with several tubes and might be difficult. It' s heartening to
    know that the baby has a good chance of getting well. Just hope he does not
    suffer much structural damage. Thanks again.

    Treating is always a possibility, but it is wise to Measure first. 
    You can always measure a baby, no matter how small the fingers are. I have
    never experienced problems with this. But I recommend that you only start
    with measuring on kids when you are very proficient in measuring and do not
    take too much time in  finding Points and Remedies.

    I would start Treating the moment she is off the Proton Pump Inhibitor.
    Treat (after Vaccinations, Scars and Whiplash) immediately the Gallbladder
    and Stomach, even if measuring is not possible.
    At this stage a Chikey would be very helpful.

Numbness (Left Side Body)

joellegoldmanjoellegoldman
January 2014 edited January 2014 in Symptoms Flag
Potential Client:
Man 79 years old. 

History:
Experienced the war in Indonesia when young.
Attack of "War-Syndrom" one month ago => after that he started to feel
numbness (left side starting with the feet) 

Diagnosis Hospital:
MRI => 3 spots on the right side of the brain ( 2cm on the motor cortex
(surrounded by a leak of fluid), 1 cm and 1 smaller one ) 
Body Scan => showed the body was "functioning perfectly" (At this point the
numbness had also moved to his left arm) 
PET-Scan => showed nothing

Doctors didn't understand the case => because the body scan didn't show
anything and according to them tumours in this part of the brain can't start
from there.

Medical Therapy Plan:
Prednison (should dissolve the fluid, and possibly helped because he moved his
left hand a little)
Possible general Radiation Therapy. 
It's to deep to operate, so the prognosis is very bad.

Questions:
1. Does anyone have any experience with clients with this type of numbness. Any
possible causes that can be related also from the perspective of meridians and
Biontology. The doctors are clueless about why nothing is showing on the Body
scan and don't really understand the case from their perspective.

2. Does this look like a too hard case to treat?

3. I would like to try to treat this person, so any suggestions are very
welcome!

    I am anxious to learn what kind of symptoms the man had when he had his "
    war syndrome attack".

    Answers:
    1. The medical profession will probably point the finger at the Nerves
    (Brain) alone, but although the Nerves might be affected too, I believe the
    numbness is likely to be caused by bad Circulation, which also explain the
    "spots" in the Brain, that I suspect to be Cysts 
   
    2. This can never be predicted before you have treated him and can observe
    his response to it.
   
    3. Of course follow the protocol steps, but especially be aware of
    Circulation (and all the different causes for bad Circulation!)

    War History:
    Father was held in a Japanese camp during the war in Indonesia when he was
    little, while his mother he and his brothers where put out of there home.
   
    Expression of his War Syndrome: 
    Huge resentment against Japanese people => not wanting to have any contact
    with them and making hateful comments against Japanese.
    This expresses itself mainly when triggered by news or remarks of others. 
    His numbness started during a hateful outburst, so bad that his wife and
    friends left the table. 

    Question:
    1. If the doctors decide to do Radiation Therapy. Could he be treated
    after, or during?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    January 2014 edited January 2014 Flag
    Answer:
    1. It is possible to treat also during the Radiation Therapy, but Radiation
    Treatment for the Brain is very dangerous. The doctors will say that it is
    very specific, but the whole Brain and all the Blood (which travels
    everywhere) is always affected. Radiation is also very negative to the
    whole Hormonal System and thus to Self Healing…

    In treatment for unresolved Trauma like this, focus on Gallbladder and
    Adrenals, and then the Liver when it is time. The cramping caused by
    Gallbladder issues and the lack of "Fuel" of the Adrenals are both a
    probable Cause of Circulatory issues and thus for the Cysts (Brain Tumours
    in my experience are usually caused by Cysts).

    When he starts to talk, try to guide him through his feelings by asking
    questions. Hateful outbursts are sign of major Suppression. He needs to
    express himself, not wait until a trigger forces the emotions to come out!
    Right now he is controlled by the past because he puts it away.

    observing becomes their reality.. and for the very reason explained in the
    video.. they are part of what they are observing. So it is both depending
    on which they are observing.. So interesting..

Weak Eye Muscle - Myasthenia Gravis

Irina
June 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
Woman 51 years old.

Symptoms:
Weak Eye Muscle (right eye),
Droopy eye lid,
Feeling like the eye drops or jumps and goes out of focus, 
Right eye is not coordinated with the left eye, 
Difficulty reading, driving or doing detailed work,
Condition improves after restful period
Fear, frustration and anger because of the eye problems affecting her job. 
She has a lot of stress at work.

Medical Diagnosis:
Myasthenia Gravis

History:
Survived a fire (20 yrs ago) => burn wounds on hands and more than half of her
back.
Skin grafts were taken from upper legs.
She has a lot of Scar Tissue ==> not linear, but big and uneven patches,
rectangles (from grafts). 

1st Session
I spent over an hour for treating just scars and still wonder if I did it
right.

2nd Session
Some drops on her hands => balanced by Appendicitis.
Feet: Few drops on Gallbladder and some on Liver.

Questions:
1. How do we treat areas with a lot of very big scar tissue?
I tried to break the spaces evenly every 7cm, touching the scar and the normal
skin. However in some areas it was impossible to do.

2. I think in her case Gall Bladder and Liver are the primary cause. Am I on
the right track?

3. I balanced her drops with Billiary Cirrhosis and Zirrhose Hepatis. We know
that we should not start to treat Liver for the first 3-5 treatments.
Could we start treating Liver if it really speaks at the beginning?

4. Where should I place my main focus in this case?

    When you do so many scar treatments it could properly mask some drops if
    you did not measure before treating the scars. 
    I think Gallbladder also, maybe Stomach too. But you must describe your
    measurement more accurate if you shall have the appropriate help. Liver you
    must wait.

    1. When you have a scar that is not a line, but covers a whole area wider
    than 7cm, the centre is out of reach... So unfortunately you'll just have
    to continue as you did and go along de borders of the burn-scar and hope
    this is enough. 

    I don't know whether you mentioned all the points that you measured, but it
    is unlikely the Hormonal System and especially the Adrenals didn't show any
    drops at all. So probably the Scars are still causing inaccurate
    readings... and many imbalances are out of your sight.

    2. Muscle Weakness/Tension = Liver/Gallbladder, so these systems are
    definitely involved. But don't forget the Stomach meridian either since it
    runs along the Eye and can also cause weakness in that particular area. In
    Chinese Medicine drooping eyelids are considered a weakness in the Earth
    element (Spleen/Stomach). 
    Botulism is a Cause for drooping eyelids.. it has similarities to
    Myasthenia Gravis (see this link...) so this Nosode can be used to treat
    it.

    3. Never treat the Liver right away, even if you measure it.

    4. I would continue the treatment of the Scars and focus on Stomach,
    Gallbladder and Adrenals first before you continue with the Liver.

    Thank you for suggestions!
    So far I have treated this lady two times.

    Measurement Triple Warmer:
    Adrenals
    Pancreatic glands
    Sex glands
    I corrected those points, and used Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus as well.

    1st Session => Drops on Stomach. Small Intestines balanced with
    Leptospirose + Brucellosis => Corrected Stomach too.
    2nd Session => no drops on Stomach, most drops found on Liver and Gall
    Bladder.

    Question:
    You said  "I would continue the treatment of the Scars..."
    Do I need to treat the scars on every next treatment? 
    All of the scars? 
    Or scars that obviously run along the meridians? 
    Or complicated looking, nutting scars?

    The smaller scars are usually "unblocked" within one treatment, but I am
    concerned about the bigger ones. So these are the ones I was referring to
    when I wrote "I would continue the treatment of the Scars..."

    Scar treatment is very important, but time-consuming...
    If you have a Chikey, you can maybe temporarily give it to her so she can
    treat the scars herself at home for some time. This way you can focus on
    the measurements, assessment and treatment in your sessions with her
    without "wasting" time on the scars...

My First Mistake…. ???

SVitale
May 2014 edited May 2014 in Biontology Insights Flag
Yes, Karolina, I am loving the Chiren. I have 'tuned' my wife, Ann's light with
it already.

Medical History:
Uterine Cancer (metastatic, "terminal" cancer) => terminated in 1989 without
chemo or radiation

Symptoms:
Ever since 1989 she wakes up everyday with a raw, hollow, nervous, irritated
pain from her mouth to her lower abdomen, like a knife.

The day after the first Chiren Session:
The above symptoms have ended....two days still ended. Before Chiren,
acupuncture would relieve it, but then it recurred, I could not get to the
cause.

Assessment and Treatment:
I measured all the points, but did not record the 'drops'

Thyroid and Parathyroid were dropping => so I did a Whiplash Treatment

2nd Measurement:
Pituitary Gland - Poliomyelitis
Parathyroid - Anti-Tetanus
Pineal Gland - Variolinum
Small Intestine - Gastritis
Circulation (Aorta) - Apis
Large Intestine (Plexus Illiaci) - Chronic Appendicitis

Question:
I wondered why the Thyroid did not show… maybe poor technique?

Responses to the treatment:
Extreme reactions:
Heavy sensation => like under pressure
Fell asleep with in 30 min of the treatment => awoke every two hours or so
Felt the movement of 'change' from the bottom of her body to the head.

Comments:
If she did not have experience in contemplative practices, as she does, she
thinks it might have been very frightening.
It seems the aorta was the "over" treatment in this case (and thank the Light
for its intelligence).
I feel a little shook up about this if, in fact, it is a mistake.

Questions:
I was a little confused when I did as I added Apis with Aorta and Chronic
Appendex with Illium, on the first treatment.  
I am confused about treating the Hormones first: does this mean we only treat
the hormones or do we then look for remedies that resolve the kidney and
bowels. I was looking at a youtube class of Johan, Intro Part 9, and he did
colon, nervous system along with the hormones. In the Protocol it doesn't
highlight this in the sequence. After step 7, (this May NYC class), I would
expect it to say, 'treat the hormones before you go on to the kidneys." etc....

    Hi Stefano,

    The Hormone System always needs to be treated first, and the Kidneys can
    never be skipped. Even if the Kidneys don't drop you need to support them
    especially the first couple of treatments. 
    The Intestines are often a cause of great problems throughout the body, and
    Appendicitis (any form) when present is also a problem that usually is
    addressed the first treatment. So the choices you made in your treatment
    actually seem to be very good.

    The Measurement Protocol will be updated to make it more accessible and
    clear, since answering questions like yours right now has given me a good
    impression where it causes confusion. I just did not find the time yet.
    Next project! ;-)

    Regarding the treatment of your wife I have some questions and comments:
   
    * Why do you find it curious that the Thyroid did not drop anymore after
    you did the Whiplash treatment? This is quite common actually, since
    disturbance of the Thyroid is often caused by Whiplash…. (you: "wondered
    why thyroid did not show, maybe poor technique?")

    * Did you finish this session with the footplate (Dyslexia) treatment as
    indicated in the protocol?

    * Did you only use the remedies that you mentioned above? Or did you also
    use Support remedies on the footplates. It is very important to support the
    body with the healing that is initiated by treating with nosodes… The
    overreaction might be caused by a lack of support, especially for the
    Kidneys…

    * Did your wife drink water after the treatment?

    * Why do you think that it is the Aorta that caused the symptoms after
    treatment? 

    * Since Chiren treatment always lifts suppression, and you never know what
    symptoms will appear, it is wise to use a support like Atropinum or
    Chelidonium the first time to calm the Gallbladder system. Even though you
    did not measure it, it is quite uncommon for the Gallbladder meridian to
    not have an imbalance, so you might measure it the next time due to the
    lift of suppression. 
    Chelidonium also contains Belladonna which is very good for inflammation,
    so this also supports the healing of the Small and Large Intestine, which
    both show inflammations.

    * Another possibility is that your wife is very "energy aware" which might
    cause a more intense experience of the energetic shift…  or was the
    experience more physical?

    * Anyway. You really did something good for her body too, since her
    symptoms are still gone! The challenge is to treat with this kind of a
    result but with as little uncomfortable responses (or as some call it
    "healing reaction" or "detox") as possible. But of course sometimes you
    just can't prevent some discomfort…

    Thyroid resolved after whiplash - just a misconception on my part.

    She did drink water.

    Dyslexia - this is where my confusion and lack of protocol precision came
    in.  I over emphasized the statement 'do the hormones first' and did not
    understand that the footplate part of thefirst procedure.  My thinking was
    that it would be the 'second' treatment...ooopss.

    Ann is very energy sensitive.

    I understand now that after the hand treatment then the points are re
    measured and the hormonal, circulatory and kidneys as well as the gall
    bladder should be done as well.  I thought this to be the second treatment

    Now a question arises, after the hand treatment, points are re measured and
    remedies are found, do we do the hand again or do we do only the feet ??
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    May 2014 Flag
    OK…. here's the confusion. In a session… you always do a hand-treatment
    first and the footplate (Dyslexia) treatment second. 

    A session always consists of those two treatments… nothing more. Only when
    in highly unusual cases. Or if you are not that skilled yet and find after
    the footplates that the Hormone System or Kidney meridian drops you can use
    a short treatment with just the remedies to correct those… This is because
    you should never leave a client after treatment with drops on either of
    those systems.

    Always try to limit the number of nosodes to 8 and then support with
    another 8 Homaccords/Compositae on the footplates.

    When you use Chronic Appendicitis always use the acute form (Appendicitis)
    too, because you don't want to risk a flare up of the inflammation when it
    transforms from the chronic form to a more acute stage.

    Got it.  I thought we did the same remedies for the footplate.  So this is
    clear now, thanks.  I am not sure as to the use of the Homacords and
    Compostiae yet. I will study to get this more clear.

    I did not understand that we were to not have drops after the treatments,
    as well.  I think my mind is obsfucated with toxins....
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    You can leave drops, but not on the Kidneys and Hormone System.
  • 
    SVitale
    May 2014 Flag
    Yes, I'm reviewing the protocol and I see that is why she had such a hard
    time, I think, since the kidney was not checked with the remedies.  It was
    ok before the remedies so I thought that meant it was strong.  But when you
    test the points with the remedies chosen for the Hormones this may change
    the picture for the kidney.  I now have to figure out how to resolve the
    kidney so the burden is lifted from the kidney.  Does this entail removing
    some remedies from the slots?  Or finding remedies that resolve the kidney
    pts?  I'm not going to sleep well tonite....

    You don't have to remove remedies from the slots, but need to find remedies

3 years old Alpha's body is Twitching about every half minute. She came to see
me having  some Food Intolerance, Allergies and Diarrhea.

Treatment: Food Poisoning Nosodes + Intestinal Support Remedies
For Twitching I was thinking to apply the Gallbladder Remedies.  

I'll appreciate any other suggestions.

    Also remember:
    All Vaccines and Medications animals receive nowadays. 
    Many years ago -before all the pet regulations- I never heard of/observed
    all of the problems animals are having right now.

    I live in an area where we are not checked, so I don't follow these
    regulations.

    Own Biontology experience with animals:
    Treated several Dogs + Chickens
    Used picture between footplates and then measured the (beforehand balanced)
    owner, which is quite time consuming.

    Treatment of my own dog:
    Since I returned from my training (which was a year and a half after her
    injury) I have been treating her. 
   
    History:
    She was paralyzed for a month after being attacked by another dog. 
    Symptoms that remained after restored walking:
    Pain (needed an aspirin every day), Lack of Bowel Control, Limited use of
    Hind Legs.

    Results:
    Straightened legs for walking.
    Pain subsided => no more need for aspirin
    Bowel and Urine Control => improved but not totally corrected (probably a
    more structural issue) 
    Feeling in Hind Legs => still not completely returned

    Initial nervousness around treatments.
    My trick was to sit on the floor with the footplates hidden under my legs
    and get her to get up on my legs. Once she relaxed and kind of fell asleep,
    I would get her hind feet down on the footplates. 

    Now she's "asking" for treatment herself when needed (when twisted, raised
    area in spin is visible and she's stretching a lot). 
    She comes in by the Chiren and jumps up begging for a treatment and now
    jumps on the footplates without me even coaxing her onto my lap. 
    Now she just gets on them all by herself and sits there for the full 16
    minutes and won't get up once the treatment is over. Animals understand
    what helps them! 
   
    By the way she is a small dog, but I have treated a larger dog in this way,
    also. (she was a large well mannered dog that suddenly was unable to walk.
    I of course measured Lyme on her, which most dogs now get in the U.S. - she
    is doing much better also).

    Ronda:
    Just a short explanation about the surrogate measuring process in order to
    ensure that you and everyone else reading your comment, understand the full
    process:

    1. Treat the surrogate (= person you are measuring) until there are no more
    drops
    2. Take one of the fibre optic cables and with this attach one footplate to
    the Cup-Socket
    3. Put the photo of the animal face down on the footplate (so not in
    between footplates!)
    4. Measure the surrogate as usual and find the remedies that balance the
    drops.
    5. Treat the animal with these remedies, preferably by using the rods or
    plates on the animal itself, but you might also put the picture in between
    the footplates (so the set-up for treating is different from the set-up for
    measuring!)

    The dog Coqueta is 3 years old.
    Her owner brought her with diarrhea, allergy. It was at the end of April.
    I treated the dog without the measurements, by her symptoms.

    1-st 2-7 program:
    - Tuberculinum Bovinum
    - Botulism
    - Brucella Abortus Bang
    - SalmonellaTyphi
    - Salmonella Paratyphi
    - Brucellosis
    - Leptospirose Canicola

    2-nd 2-7 program:
    - Nux Vomica
    - Pyrogenium
    - Sutoxol
    - Diarrheel
    - Mucosa
    - Veratrum
    - Echnacea

    After that the dog felt better.

    On June 18 Coqueta came over again. She stopped eating, had again diarrhea
    with some blood in the stool.
    Her usual stool has been on the loose side.
    Had the ear infection.

    I treated her by symptoms without measurements.

    1-st 2-7 program:
    - Appendicitis
    - Chronic Appendicitis
    - Salmonella Typhi
    - Salmonella Paratyphi
    - Leptosrirose
    - Botulism
    - Tubeculinum Bovinum
    - Pyrogenium

    2-nd 2-7 program:
    - Tonsilla Comp
    - Nux Vomica
    - Veratrum
    - Diarrheel
    - Podophyllum
    - Chelidonium
    - Mucosa
    - Bact. Pyo

    Now a week later... I just spoke with the owner. Coqueta still has an upset
    stomach, some diarrhea.
    Her appetite is not as good. Sometimes she eats, sometimes she does not.

    I feel that I didn't find the cause of the problem.
    How could I help Coqueta?
    Greatly appreciate any input.

    My Treatment
    I have treated the dogs both by symptom treating and in the exact above
    protocol Karolina stated. 
    Results
    My observation was that by balancing the owner and then measuring the dog,
    I achieved much better results. But again, like I mentioned earlier, it is
    very time consuming (at least as a new Biontologist).
    Remember
    -Check for vaccination things also, as there are so many that are given to
    animals now. =>Anti-Tetanus, Serum Ovile
    -I have also measured =>Campylobacter Pylori 
    -I have done the Whiplash treatment on them. With my dog who was paralyzed,
    I do it all along the spine for healing.

    Karolina,

    Regarding your June 26th post above: #5. “Treat the animal with these
    remedies, preferably by using the rods or plates on the animal itself, but
    you might also put the picture in between the footplates.”

    If sandwiching the photo between the two plates for treatment: Would it
    face towards the blue footplate or the one without the light?

    For treating people:   I’ve heard of sandwiching TWO photos between the
    plates (a head and shoulders view of the front and another one of the back
    of the person), with the frontal view facing up towards the fooplate that
    has no light and the picture of the back of the head facing down on top of
    the blue plate. Is this considered correct?

    Is it possible to do surrogate whiplash treatment by placing the rods over
    a photo of the back of the neck (assuming we have a rear view photo)?
    During the whiplash treatment does the photo need to be on one of the
    footplates and if so, facing up or down, and on which footplate?

    Can anything be done for a remote client if the surrogate's points measure
    for spin? If not, is there any point in continuing to measure and providing
    a remote treatment since the treatment will work if they are in correct
    spin?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    July 2013 edited February 2014 Flag
    * I does not seem to make any difference what way the front of the photo is
    facing.

    * Sandwiching photos is nonsense. 
    It is possible to place one photo on one plate, and another one on the
    other plate. But it is not more effective, maybe even less. In normal
    treatment, there is also only one you that holds both rods. So one photo
    between the plates is the rule..

    * It is possible to do a Whiplash treatment on a photo of the neck. Place
    the photo on the table and hold the rods on the photo the same way as you
    do a normal Whiplash treatment, in the neck.

    * Treatments will only work if the remote client is not in an Inverted
    Spin. 
    The question is: is the surrogate in Spin Inversion or the remote Client? 
    You can treat a remote Client for Spin Inversion but not by means of a
    surrogate. You'll need both the blood and picture of the Client to treat
    the Spin Inversion remotely.

    Questions:

    1. Is it best to treat with a full body photo rather than a head and neck
    photo?

    2. Is the whiplash treatment done on the front of the neck since the photo
    would be a frontal view?

    3. How would you treat a remote client for Spin Inversion when fresh blood
    is needed?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    July 2013 edited July 2013 Flag
    1. The photo is there to make a connection with the remote Client's energy,
    and a picture of the head and neck is sufficient in doing so. So there's no
    need for a full body photo.

    2. When possible I would use a photo from the back of the neck. If not,
    you'll just have to work with whatever you have and then measure on the
    surrogate if it was sufficient.
    Mind that working with a surrogate is never optimal, but sometimes it is
    just the best you can do.

    3. Fresh Blood is preferable since it has a 100% resonance with the Client
    in the current situation. This is of course not possible when you work
    remotely, so the old blood will have to do (and it does, but the extra
    advantages of treating with ones own blood will be lessened)

    Thank you for explaining the surrogate measuring method.

    As for the case of dog Coqueta... 
    I am trying to make clear for myself and owner of the dog the right
    protocol for treating the animals.
    I had few cases when after just one treatment ( by symptoms) the dog was
    fine.

    Questions:
    1. Should I measure and treat her owner in order to see the results?
    2. Treating the dog by it's symptoms is not a right way to treat animals?
    3. Even though animals respond quickly for the treatments, could it be the
    case when one treatment is just simply not enough to treat serious
    condition? And the dog might need more treatments, possibly with the same
    previously used remedies? Or it will be again just a guess?

    1. Johan never surrogate measures when he treats animals... They always
    have good results when just treated according to symptoms, as far as I have
    been able to observe (we see more humans then animals ;-))

    2. You can never tell if one treatment is enough, you'll just have to
    observe results as usual...

    3. Of course sometimes more than one treatment is needed.
    Usually animal diseases originate in food poisonings. When remedies are
    needed a second time, there is probably an ongoing source of
    disturbance.... take a good look at the food.

Kidneys and Bladder had the main focus.
It was interesting to see that now 8 out of 10 turned into clear green :)

    I am sorry but I do not see your main focus on Kidneys and Bladder. 

    Your description does not indicate what you measured and where. It also
    does not indicate what points dropped on hands and feet. 

    This type of information is not really helpful to anybody.

    I see your point. 
    I just used the Bladder and Kidney as a help to see if anything on Triple
    Warmer changed.

    I found the Result of that experiment interesting. I have never experienced
    a case like this before and I wonder if there's a meaning in all this for
    the client in her situation.

    The measurements were all more or less dropping before treatment. I
    therefore focused the measurements on Bladder / Kidney (both dropping),
    which solved the rest of the drops. 
    Instead of tireing /too may measurements on the Triple Warmer, I tested on
    the Bladder and Kidney and that solved the rest.

    Results:
    She has detoxed after the Treatment and feels Stonger and more Balanced.
    I will see her once more before I go to China.

    You didn't focus on the Bladder/Kidneys the way Johan uses this word
    (concentration on a specific organ system in treatment), but I do
    understand what you mean, you focussed your measurement and search for
    remedies on the Kidney/Bladder meridians.

    This is a good example of how you sometimes find a solution by what I call
    Cross-Measuring ==> Something affecting one meridian also affects another
    and then when you fix one of the two the other one automatically corrects
    at the same time....

    However I also see that you didn't correct everything by the Hand
    Treatment, and not even by the Footplates, since you needed another Short
    Program at the end with Nosodes.... So solving the Kidney/Bladder imbalance
    first didn't solve all imbalances it seems?

Narcolepsy with Cataplexy

Jennifer IveyJennifer Ivey
November 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
New Client:
Man 50 years old, diagnosed with Narcolepsy and Cataplexy, has been told that
even with our wonderful Canadian Healthcare System. he will have to pay out
$60,000 a year for his meds.

I was so fascinated to watch a Canadian news show just last week, documenting
the alarming number of children around the world who are suffering from
narcolepsy and no one has been able to help them. 
What do they all have in common? They all received the H1N1 vaccine! I wrote to
my future client and sure enough he also had received it. 

Medical Diagnosis:
Narcolepsy and Cataplexy

History:
Problem started when he was prescribed Immitrex 50MG for migraine headaches.
Year after that he received a Twinrix (Hep A & Hep B) and regular flu vaccine
He then experienced episodes of total lack of muscle control. 
Eventually the H1N1 vaccine brought on the narcolepsy.
Paralyzed or in full on cataplexy without medication....

Symptoms:
Migraine headaches
Episodes of total lack of muscle control
Narcolepsy

Medication:
Many medications that he can't do without (becomes fully paralyzed or in full
on cataplexy)

Question:
I am guessing that Gallbladder, Stomach and Liver are huge issues, but I would
love some further guidance on precautions, treatments or suggestions!.

    The Swine Flu vaccination has caused narcolepsy in more people, this is a
    known fact... 

    The development of symptoms in your client, from migraine toward narcolepsy
    and cataplexy show that there's an earlier sensitivity to toxins. This is
    why he reacted so severely to this particular vaccination and most others
    don't. The underlying problem with detoxification has to be addressed. 
   
    The Migraines point toward Gallbladder/Liver and Stomach. Narcolepsy might
    be connected to the Stomach meridian too.
    See whether there's Whiplash first, treat the Hormone System, then treat
    Kidneys/Bladder... they have to be in good condition to detoxify.
   
    The vaccinations your client received contain Mercury (Thiomersal) and
    Formaldehyde, which can be treated with the Chiren. I would not advise to
    do this the first treatment, unless they show up on the Hormone System.
    Otherwise it is best to wait until the elimination pathways, especially
    Kidneys, are working well enough. And of course you only treat when you get
    a confirmation in the measurements. (put them in and see what they balance)
   
    Same for the HepA and HepB vaccinations, when the Hepatitis remedies show
    up on the Hormone System, they have to be treated the first session. But
    otherwise, let the Liver be for now. Treating the Liver right away can give
    a huge reaction (extreme fatigue, rise in blood pressure = dangerous when
    there are weak/calcified veins and arteries!, flaring up of infections
    because of lifted suppression, kidney pain because of the release of more
    toxins than they can handle etc.).

    Thanks very much Karolina. Of course I will be careful with the liver.
    Extreme fatigue is the last thing he needs on top of narcolepsy! Sad to
    think the young children affected might also be so full of toxins at such a
    young age.

    There's hardly any way around it anymore... even in the womb babies are
    already exposed to many toxins. Fortunately the Chiren can assist with
    detoxification.

March 2013 edited February 2014 in Symptoms Flag
Have a client who has Alopecia Universalis (losing body hair all over). Can you
please shed any light on treating him?

He had served time in Iraq 2003, where they were to taking NAPS which is "nerve
agent" tablets during his time there (1 month). He was serving in the British
Navy, 40 years old. The losing hair all over starting 2007.

Have just begun his treatments.. but any suggestions on this one is
appreciated.. 

thanks

    What did you measure? What did you treat? How did your client respond? What
    are the other symptoms he has?  How is his life situation at the moment? Is
    there any stress?

    Follow protocol the first treatments and if you then get stuck you have
    more information, so we can assist you.

    First Session:

    Client:
    lives and works for a Shipping company in Sri Lanka, from the UK
    Many accidents.. lots of broken bones, mainly his neck was broken, his
    back, hands, knees through car accidents and motorbike accidents.. NO big
    scars on his body.. which is amazing.
    Though he looks physically in shape, very athletic body, he has problems
    with breathing sometimes.. He is a diver by profession.
    Today he is traveling cross country on his motor bike. Stayed here in
    Sedona, going to Grand Canyon but coming back for more sessions. He says he
    is not stressed.. but he is.. he runs on willpower, so it feels to me.

    Medical interventions:
    Lots of vaccinations, including the military vaccinations for the war in
    Iraq which included the mentioned NAT - something for nerve gas.
    Got 8 rabies shots.. after getting bit by a dog..

    Symptoms:
    He says his memory is bad..lots of brain fog and he says his sleep is not
    good.

    Measurement:
    Tried to measure him but all points dropped initially, until I did 2
    Whiplash treatments and 2 Spin Inversion treatments.

    Hand treatment:
    Triple Warmer - Poliomyelitis, Diptheria, Serum Ovile, Tuberculinum,
    Variolinum, Formaldyhyde
    Small Intestines & Large Intestines = Campylobacter Pylori, Salmonella
    typhi, Bact Proteus, Chronic Appendendicitis
    Lungs - Staphylococcae
    Nervous System Alumininum, Mercury
    Gallbladder - Atropinum, Berberis

    Dyslexia treatment:
    Cerebrum, Viscum, Thalamus + Ozaliet

    He other vaccines but they did not show up as yet.. Yellow Fever, Malaria,
    Hep A-B, Strange thing was that the Tetatnus did not show up.. Will check
    for these on his next visit..

    I have no idea cause of Alopecia Universlis is a first for me. I thought he
    was just shaving his head intentionally.. but he tells me now it bothers
    him, because now his eyebrows are not there.. no side burns.. and he feels
    it makes him look older. He does have a beard that he has to shave.. so the
    facial hair is still there.
    Thanks so much for your feedback..

    The best remedy for Alopecia is Cutis Compositum. 

    You should any way check the Skin meridian, perhaps Schwefheel and Psorinum
    match there, but symptomatically Cutis Compositum is the best one.

    I believe Alopecia could also be caused by Spleen and Pineal gland
    disturbances.

    Hi,

    It would be interesting to know if something happened not to long before
    the symptoms started.... 

    I think the Cutis, Schwefheel, and Psorinum make sense to treat with. But
    personally I'm also very interested as to what caused the hair to all of a
    sudden drop. I wouldn't be surprised if stress (physically or emotionally)
    is a factor in Alopecia.

positive, had more energy in the past week then she had in years, very pleased
with the results

Measurement: Parathyroid (drop), Pituitary (no drop), Thyroid, Pineal
Same measurements as last week!
Because of these measurements I did Scar Treatment (abdomen) and Whiplash
Treatment (back of neck and at spots on spine that bothered her).
After this the Pituitary gland did drop. I tried all the remedies listed for
the Pituitary but could not get it NOT to drop. I tried Poliomyelitis,
Variolinum, varicellen, and all the Airborne Toxins that were listed and still
the pituitary dropped. So I continued to measure the other points anyway. The

Question: I would appreciate any Help and constructive criticism and/or
evaluation you may have of this case and how I am handling it. My big question
is why is the Pituitary gland still dropping and why can’t I fix it??

This client's next appointment is in two weeks (4/23/2013). It is very
difficult for her to get to my home office because it is an 8 hour round trip,
and she is caring for her ailing father.

    Hi Janet,

    Could you please use the "Clipboard button with letter T" in the formatting
    bar above the text box to post comments that were created outside the
    forum. It is almost impossible to bring structure if you copy text with
    program format (other program used than this forum).... 

    Also there has to be made more distinction between information that is
    relevant and less relevant. That's why I always separate Symptoms from
    Medical Diagnoses and Interventions. It is good to know the last part, but
    the Symptom part is what is most important! And for better insight into the
    complete situation we like them in different sections. 

    All this and more is explained in these sections:

    1st session

    - I miss remedies for the Parathyroid, Pineal and Thyroid: Why did you
    choose not to balance them with nosodes like Anti-Tetanus, Pertussis and
    Polio? Even if you didn't find the Pituitary to drop, you still have to put
    in the remedy Poliomyelitis. Pertussis often brings the Pineal gland into
    line, and in turn the Thyroid will be balanced.

    - The Heart: it is unlikely that Selenium matched, although it is
    theoretically possible. But if the Heart in the second session dropped
    again. Because of this you must assume that the remedy you used in session
    1 was not correct.
    And you always have to try nosodes first. The Strep and Staph nosodes are
    likely to balance the Lungs as well.

    - I have almost never seen Food Poisoning matching on the Right Hand. Only
    when it has become very Chronic and the Immune System is completely down it
    can show up there, but this is very, very rare. It is more likely that
    Appendicitis (Chronic, Necroticans) would have matched.

    - It is dangerous to treat the Liver in the first sessions, even if it
    shows. This could lead to too Heavy Detox. It is important to treat
    according to protocol and to address the Yang Organs first! If the
    Elimination Organs have improved, the Liver can be treated. 
    Luckily this client didn't experience severe adverse effects, but in the
    future, please follow the right order of treatment to prevent heavy
    reactions.

    - You use too many Support Remedies and do not solve Causes as is
    demonstrated in your second session. 

    - The protocol states that after the Basic Treatment >12, there should be
    the Dyslexia program. No Short Treatment in between.

    - Try to approach the client in a more structured way. Your approach right
    now seems to be rather chaotic.

    2nd Session

    - You had almost the same measurements as in the first session. This shows
    that in the first session you did not address any causes. Causes cannot be
    remedied by Support Remedies.

    - The Brain Fog is generally solved by Intestinal Flora. That these
    Bacteria appear to be gone strengthens my opinion that Appendicitis is
    present in one or other form. 
    Only when the Appendicitis is gone and the Climate of the Intestines
    becomes healthy again, the Intestinal Flora can restore itself. Before that
    happens, treating with just the Intestinal Flora Bacteria won't solve the
    problem...

    - The Hot Flashes are always Hormonal. So the Hormonal System must be
    corrected first. This must always be your first concern, before you focus
    on anything else.

    - The Pituitary is still dropping because (I believe) you have not used the
    main remedies for the Pituitary.
    The main remedies are Polio, Variolinum.
    Other remedies that sometimes balance the Pituitary are Appendicitis
    (Acute, Chronic, Necroticans) and Tonsillitis (Acute, Chronic). It could be
    that there are these problems and that they are affecting the gland. But I
    would put the Poliomyelitis and the Variolinum in any way.
   
    (If something doesn't show up that always shows up (Poliomyelitis,
    Anti-Tetanus), this is a reason to doubt the measurements and then you can
    try these remedies anyway...)

    Karolina, Thank you for your efforts in editing the above case.  I did hit
    the "Clipboard button with letter T" when I copied the case from word. 
    From now on I will type the case directly into the forum and then copy that
    back into word for my record.

    Johan,  I did use all the remedies that you listed for the Pituitary. I
    will use the other remedies that you mentioned above in addition to the
    main remedies to see if I can balance the Pituitary.  And yes, I did
    balance all of the other endocrine system points before moving to the other
    points.  Thank you for your advice.  I will definitely make the changes
    that you suggested.  I can see that the above case is very confusing even
    after Karolina made editorial changes.  It really didn't come out
    correctly.

    The session is pretty readable like this. I think it is not the information
    about your sessions that is wrong, (you just wrote down the steps you took
    and all treatments and remedies you used, so there can't be any confusion
    about that), but you misunderstood some of the basic steps in the protocol.
    But that's what the Forum is for. Don't be bothered to much by it and just
    change focus in the next session with these pointers:

    *when someone has been vaccinated for Polio, this is always the biggest
    disturber for the Pituitary and should be addressed.
    *no more middle treatment = less remedies
    *try to deduct a Cause and focus your support on the Organ Systems that
    need it the most.
    *don't treat the Liver this early in treatment
    well.... all pointers Johan gave actually.

    If you need more explanation or don't understand the comments, please keep
    asking. I'm happy to assist, and if I don't understand myself I'll ask
    Johan ;-) 

    Thank you very much for putting in all the effort to present this case and
    I'm looking forward to the next steps and results!

    I did follow Johan's Protocol and since both the thyroid and parathyroid
    dropped I did the whiplash. The Thyroid and Para- thyroid no longer
    dropped. The PCB balanced the pineal gland.

    The Pituitary gland initially did not drop but after the Whiplash treatment
    It started to drop and I used all the remedies suggested in the latest 
    protocol Including Poliomyelitis and Variolinum and still I could not get
    it to balance.  I will follow Johan's suggestion and try the following
    Appendicitis (Acute, Chronic, Necroticans) and Tonsillitis (Acute, Chronic)
    to see if that will balance the Pituitary. 

     The client canceled her last appointment because of a cold.  She
    rescheduled and I will see her Tuesday morning.  I will write up her case
    as you suggested above and post it.

    I have one client with "perpetual" drops on Pineal and Thyroid glands
    (Triple Warmer, Right hand only).  She has been given matching remedies to
    Triple Warmer: Poliomyelitis, Anti-Tetanus, Tuberculinum, Variolinum and
    Toxins (Mercury, Plumbum Met. PCB and Dioxin).

    Nothing matches now but Thalamus and Thyroidea, which I suspect only brings
    temporary balance.
    She initially had problems stemming from Brucellosis / Brucella Abortus
    Bang with Liver/Gallbladder Inflammation. 

    Yesterday she came with Flu-Like Symptoms and it was again Brucella Abortus
    Bang. Her stuffed for 3 days nose and off-balance symptoms were cleared
    during the session (she noticed that with question "What did you do? I can
    breeze through my nose now!"). We "traced" it to her Eating Beef and
    getting "Stuffed Nose" within 24 hours.

    Question about correcting her Hormonal System: 
    She has a Highly Stressful job, could it be that Stress Level just "kicks"
    the glands out of balance? Also, her Biofeedback program Graph was always
    below middle zone (Lack of Energy?). Yesterday for the first time the Graph
    went up and nicely stayed within the middle zone, the way it is supposed to
    be. Does anybody else sees the same problem with Highly Stressed Clients?

    Hi Yelyena

    Have you used Pertussis. It is a great remedy when the Pineal gland drops!

    If the Thyroid still drop, then I would try Tonsillitis(+Chronic) to
    correct it.

    Succes with the Brucella Abortus Bang :-)

    No, I do not see this problem with highly stressed clients. Stress can kick
    the glands out of balance but this is mainly the Adrenals, not the
    Thyroid. 
    But Margit is right, Pertussis is often the cause of dropping Thyroid and
    Pineal. If not try indeed the Tonsils or Strumeel

    Thank you everybody! I have tried to match all suggested above remedies and
    more during several sessions but they did not match. I am trying hard not
    just put Pertussis (and Strumeel) even though it does not match... and see
    if it gets better next time.
    Will keep you updated... sometimes the body will show new "layer" when the
    body is ready.

    4th Session - May 10th

    Symptoms:
    Client felt fine,
    Energy Level Good
    Still some Heart Burn

    Measurement:
    Pituitary - no drops (balanced with Chronic Appendicitis last Session)
    No Whiplash, no Spin Inversion

    Insulin (L) - Selenium
    Thymus (L) - Selenium
    Thyroid - Chronic Tonsillitis
    Pineal - Thalamus
    Small Intestine (L - 1 point)
    Heart (L - 1 point)
    Veins (L - 1 point)
    Nervous System (L - 3 points incl. Meninges)
    Large Intestine (L - 1 point) - Appendicitis Necroticans
    Lungs (L - 2 points) - Carcinoma Bronchi, Streptococcus Viridans
    Circulation (R - 3 points = Aorta, Coronary, Cerebral)
    Large Intestine ( R - 4 points) - Chronic Appendicitis

    Bladder (L - 4 points) - Myom Uteri, Carcinoma Uteri
    Gallbladder (L - 3 points) - Calculi Billiaris
    Stomach (L - 1 point, R - 2 points)
    Spleen (1 point)

    Footplates:
    Berberis, Circulo, Doudenoheel, Hepar, Metro-Adnex, and Podophyllum,
    Carcinoma Bronchi, Streptococcus Viridans
    Last two Remedies were exchanged after 8 minutes = Populus and Renales.

    Comments and Questions:

    1. Selenium and Thalamus are Support Remedies. The Thymus, Insulin (Hyper)
    couldn't be balanced in any other way though. Should I use Gallbladder
    Nosodes for the Insulin point?

    2. What do you do when both Insulin (Hyper) and Insulin (Hypo) drop?

    3. What Remedy does one use if the individual is Hyperthyroid or
    Hypothyroid? Is that related to Hyper and Hypo Insulin?

    4. Have I addressed all the right points or should I have addressed the
    stomach because it is YANG and (hollow) instead of the lungs which are YIN
    (but I think still considered hollow)?? 

    5. In Session 3 I found Campylobacter Pylori to balance 6 points on the
    Stomach, but it did not seem to hold since 4 points dropped in Session 4.  

    6. Please review sessions 3 and 4 and let me know if I am on the right
    track. I will be seeing her the 28th again and would appreciate feedback
    before the Session. She has an 8 hour round trip to see me so I want to
    make her visit worthwhile.    

    7. How can it be that I correct the same points that drop again the
    following Session?  

    I am following the protocol and trying to use "The Five Element Theory",
    but I feel that I am not gaining much ground. Although my clients do feel
    much better...

    May 18, 5th Session.

    Again the client reported that she was feeling good. I checked her for spin
    and also for whip lash. These did no show up. So I began my measurements
    starting with the endocrine system. The drops and remedies I used are as
    follows;

    Measurement:

    Pineal - Pertussis
    Thyroid - Pertussis
    Large Intestine (L- 2 points + R - 4 points incl. App. point) -
    Diverticulosis, Periproctic Abcess, Mucosa
    Small Intestine (L- 2 points + R - 3 points)
    Veins (L- 4 points + R - 4 points)
    Circulation (L - 1 point) - Calculi Bil, Barijodeel
    Nervous system (L - 4 points incl. Meninges + R - 3 points)
    Lungs (L - 3 points + R - 1 point)
    Lymphatic System (L - Sinuses + R - 3 points)
    Heart (R - 2 points)

    Bladder (L - 2 points incl. Sexual Organs)
    Kidneys (L - 3 points + R - 2 points) - Salmonella Typhi
    Gallbladder (L - 4 points + R - 1 point)
    Stomach (L- 5 points + R - 4 points) - Ulcus Ventriculi (corrected 2 points
    on both sides)
    Liver (L - 2 points)
    Spleen/Pancreas (L - 1 point + R - 2 points)


    >12 Year Program:
    Pertussis, Diverticulosis, Periproctic Abcess, Mucosa, Salmonella Typhi,
    Ulcus Ventriculi, Calculi Bil, Barijodeel


    Footplates:
    Gastricumheel (heartburn), Mellilotus (veins), Nux Vomica (intestines),
    Placenta (circulation), Populus (kidneys), Selenium (adrenals), Thalamus
    (Pineal), Aesculus (for support of Circulation)

    Comments:

    The only point that I am satisfied with is Pituitary solved with Chronic
    Appendicitis. I thank Johan for suggesting that to me. I have difficulty
    understanding as to why on the first session I used Hamamelis and
    Barijodeel for the drop in the veins. That seemed to solve the problem
    until the 5th visit when 8 points on the veins dropped.

    To answer your questions:

    1. Gallbladder Remedies are only measured on the Insulin Low point, so not
    on the Left Hand. To balance the Insulin point on the Left Hand focus on
    the Adrenals. 
    Selenium is the right Remedy to use for the Adrenals (as shown in the
    measurement protocol), it is a potent Homaccord with both Selenium and
    Potassium in different homeopatich potencies.

    2. When both Insulin points drop, try to balance the Hyper Insulin Point
    first and then see if the Hypo Insulin Point is balanced too. If it is not,
    then use Gallbladder remedies

    3. There's no correclation between Hyper / Hypo Thyroidism and Insulin
    production.

    4. Lungs are not considered Hollow Organs (=Yang Organs). You always have
    to address the Hormonal system first and than the Yang Organs. Stomach
    hence comes before Lungs.

    5. Campylobacter Pylori is not the Cause of the problem but the result. If
    you have not solved the Cause, the problems will always come back.
    There is a continous problem with the Gallbladder and the Appendix, this
    can cause the continous drops on the stomach. In the stomach there is
    definitely Gastritis and probably an Ulcer. (=good climate for the
    Helicobacter to grow)

    6. When both Large Intestines and Lungs drop, Tuberculinum (Bovinum) is a
    potent Nosode that often matches and helps.

    Comment and Questions:
    * The Pituitary continues to drop. Although the suggested Chronic
    Appendicitis matches, after 2 weeks it started dropping again...
    * In the 5th Session there were no drops on the Triple Warmer (L) but then
    on the 6th visit there were 4 drops on the Triple Warmer again. When this
    keeps happening I am not making headway with the case at hand. Especially
    when I use all the suggested Nosodes and find that nothing balances. 

    1. What can be the reason for the treatment to hold for some time and then
    for the same drops to show up again?

    2. I didn't measure a Spin Inversion at first (only Pituitary and upper
    Heart dropped), but when I continued to measure and looked at my final
    plotting I saw all 6 points for Spin Inversion showed up... Should I have
    then done the Spin Inversion Treatment at that time??? Why didn't it show
    up when I measured for it?

    1. In the 5th Session the Appendix point was still dropping and during the
    4th session there was still Appendicitis Necroticans measurable...... You
    were on the right track treating the Appendicitis, but then the 5th session
    you didn't treat for it....so it got worse and even influenced the
    Pituitary again... 
   
    It is very unusual to measure and treat Appendicitis Necroticans and to see
    that during the next session the whole problem is gone..... Appendicitis
    needs continuous focus until it is truly gone or otherwise it will fall
    back.
   
    Also, there was a Salmonella Food Poisoning measured the 5th session and
    when someone is healing from Appendicitis and then has another infection
    like this, there often is a setback in the treatment of Appendicitis.
   
    Even if the miracle happened that Appendicitis Necroticans healed the whole
    condition of the Appendix and Intestines, you should have focussed your
    treatment on supporting further restoration of these organs by treating
    with the Intestinal Flora and maybe Mucosa... Usually after you have gone
    through all the steps of healing Appendicitis, the body will start asking
    for Intestinal Flora and this shows up in the measurements.
   
    2. If you find out before treatment, that all 6 points do drop sharply, you
    should do the Spin Inversion treatment first of course. Sometimes it might
    be a Spin Inversion that was covered up by Endorphins, although in the case
    of Endorphins you would have hardly measured anything at first (Endorphins
    are transported in the blood and are not local but influence the whole
    body)....

    Comments and Questions:
    1. You stated that you balance the Hyper Insulin point (left hand) with the
    Adrenal remedies of which Johan has only listed two remedies (Selenium and
    Berberis) He mentioned Cortisol, Aldosteron and Androgens but I cannot find
    them in the Chiren. 

    2. I am having trouble finding remedies to balance the Insulin Point on the
    Left Hand on several of my clients. Would you use remedies for the Pancreas
    and what would they be?? On the right hand you said to use the Gallbladder
    remedies.

    3. From your comments from the client's 6th visit, I hear you saying that
    the endocrine and other systems should be treated the second and third time
    even if they don't show a drop. So should I use the same remedies that I
    had used the last time since they seem to be the correct ones, and just run
    them again two, three and even four times??

    I appreciate all the information and constructive criticism that you give
    to me. I definitely want to learn the correct procedure.

    Hi Janet,
    I don't understand the text appearing in a strange format again... however
    it was easy to correct this time by copy-pasting it myself in the
    clipboard-window... 

    First some general remarks about your 7th session:  
    * You use far too many Nosodes (I forgot to address this in the previous
    sessions....). You can use some Nosodes on the footplates if needed (when
    important points still drop), but the general guideline is no more than 8
    Nosodes / Toxins / Metals in total...
    * Did you only get to correct the Hormonal System in the first
    measurements, or were all the other points also corrected? I can't see this
    in the way you have put your case together... Usually it is not needed to
    use 8 Nosodes just to get the Hormonal System right...
   
    Answers to your questions:
    1. 9 out of 10 times correcting the Pituitary and Para-Thyroid gland and
    then using Selenium and/or Berberis to correct the Adrenals is enough to
    balance the Hyper Insulin Point.
   
    Cortisol, Aldosteron and Androgens are Hormones produced by the Adrenals
    and it is good to know about them and what they do so you can use symptoms
    of Adrenal exhaustion in your assessment. However, treating with them would
    be Symptom Treatment, and since Biontology is designed to go to the core of
    an issue there are no remedies for them in the Chiren...  The production of
    all these hormones will be corrected when you correct the Adrenal point
    (usually with Selenium/Berberis).

    In this discussion you find the steps that can be taken if Selenium/
    Berberis don't work.

    2. Have you taken all steps? ==> Childhood diseases... Toxins... Balancing
    Adrenals first, All stages of Appendicitises/Tonsillitises?
    Are the drops steep when you can't correct them? It might also be an
    energetic problem... 
   
    3. ? I didn't mention the Hormonal System in my comment of may 31.... can
    you please quote the text you're referring to so I can see the context? 
    When there are no drops and no Symptoms suggesting that there should be
    drops (measurement problem..), then there's no need to treat the Hormonal
    System every time... so I don't know what I have written that might suggest
    differently.

    3. I could not find any nosode that would balance the Pituitary. 

    3rd Session ==> As suggested I tried Chronic Appendicitis, which balanced
    the Pituitary
    4th Session ==> Pituitary still balanced
    5th Session ==> Pituitary still balanced
    6th Session ==> Pituitary dropped again!
     
    You stated: "In the 5th Session the Appendix point was still dropping and
    during the 4th session there was still Appendicitis Necroticans
    measurable...... You were on the right track treating the Appendicitis but
    then the 5th session you didn't treat for it....so it got worse and even
    influenced the Pituitary again..." 
   
    4th Session ==> Large Intestine = balanced with Chronic Appendicitis and
    Appendicitis Necroticans
    5th Session ==> Large Intestine = balanced with Diverticulosis, Periproctic
    Abcess, and Mucosa 
   
    So in the 5th Session it was not Appendicitis that balanced the Large
    Intestines 
    Questions:
    #1 Do you mean that I should have used Appendicitis even if it didn't show
    up in the measurement?  
    #2 Am I right in saying that the Appendix point is on the Large Intestine
    meridian?
   
    2. Johan wrote: "Even if you didn't find the Pituitary to drop, you still
    have to put in the remedy Poliomyelitis." 
    Questions:
    #3 Does this mean that I should use the Vaccinations even if I don't
    measure them?
    #4 Is that what you mean when you state: "Have you taken all steps? ==>
    Childhood diseases..."
   
    The Hormonal System needed 8 remedies to correct it in the first Hand
    Treatment. And the drops that still dropped after that I wrote down in the
    assessment.
    My Client travels far to get a treatment and I felt I needed to try to
    correct at least some of the Yang points. This is why I used so many
    Nosodes I guess. 
   
    To avoid making the 8 hours round trip to get to me every week, my Client
    wants to buy a Chikey. And she wants me to create cards with Nosodes that I
    measure for.
    She will be using the same remedies over and over again..... until she
    decides to make another appointment. 
   
    So that is another reason I thought that one needs to put in the same
    remedies that balanced the session before. 
   
    Question:
    #5 What do you mean by "are the drops steep?" I don't know what steep drops
    are. Is it the pitch that I hear? Is is the height on the graph? 
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    June 2013 edited June 2013 Flag
    #1 When you measure Chronic Appendicitis and Appendicitis Necroticans it is
    very unlikely that the next Session it is completely gone.... And the fact
    that the Appendicitis became worse again after skipping treating it one
    Session shows this. 
    It is good to always look back at what you have done (or haven't done) and
    what the results were.... Biontology is measurement and assessment. When a
    measurement doesn't make sense you have to find out why.. When a condition
    comes back, "why?" is a question that needs to be answered. And then
    sometimes it is also needed to treat something that assessment and/or
    previous measurement clearly shows that is still in need of treatment.

    #2 The Appendix Point is the nail point on the Large Intestine meridian on
    the right hand.

    2. Johan wrote that you should always put Poliomyelitis in (unless there
    was no vaccination) because he knows that you can always measure this on
    the Pituitary in the first Session. If not, then there is a measurement
    problem. Same for Anti-Tetanus.
   
    #3 No, some Vaccinations never show up in assessment and in this case they
    are not needed in treatment. 

    #4 What I ask here is whether you have tested for all the remedies that you
    should test for/work on in order to correct the Insulin high point ===> "
    Childhood diseases... Toxins... Balancing Adrenals first, All stages of
    Appendicitises/Tonsillitises?
    Are the drops steep when you can't correct them? It might also be an
    energetic problem... "

    #5 What I mean with "steep" is that they drop very fast from high to low.
    Fast drops are an indication for an energetic problem.

    So there were a lot of drops still showing up after needing 8 remedies only
    for the Hormonal System... It still looks like a situation of Appendicitis
    Necroticans... or an energetic problem (if the points drop sharply/fast...
    did they?)
    Sharp drops can also be caused by Scars... maybe when she has the Chikey
    she can start to treat herself on that heavy abdominal scar regularly? In
    your initial post it sounds like a severe Scar that might need more
    treatment... You can create a card with just Procranium on it so Internal
    Scars can be treated too.

    Using too many Nosodes might be tempting, but using as much as you did will
    give less effect instead of more.

    Did she drive a hybrid car coming to you? This always gives a lot of
    Energetic Problems and often a Spin Inversion.

    With the Chikey cards you have to use your assessment of your clients
    condition. Not the exact combination of remedies that was needed the last
    treatment... 

    I do hope that you understand that none of the comments made are meant as
    critique... There's just so much to learn in Biontology... First the
    basics, and then everything has to come together in order for it to become
    understanding on how to work with all the different elements... It is not
    possible to explain it all at once. Practice and experience is the best way
    to learn. The questions and answers on the forum can be used as guidance...

Menstrual Period

YelyenaYelyena
June 2013 edited January 2014 in General Questions Flag
Client:
Woman 18 yrs old, with changing Menstrual Cycle. 

Symptoms:
For the last 4 months the Client's Menstrual Cycle has been getting shorter and
the Blood Flow has become less. 
Shorter Cycle ==> Used to be regular, 35 to 40 days apart. Now the last 2
months it was 30 days.
Scarcer Menstrual Flow ==> Period is about 3 days long with less Blood Flow
than should be.

Sessions:
Had many Biophoton Sessions.
Measurements generally "sound" really well, hardly ever a drop.  

Questions:
1. What can be done to help to regulate menstrual period in terms of blood
flow. We hope her body will regulate it to be 28 days apart eventually.
2. Would support with Ovarium and Hormeel (and Galbladder support) eventually
help to restore it to about 5 days with good blood flow?

    I've had success using the supports that you are mentioning with similar
    cases. However, it seems from what you are describing as if the periods
    have been regulated and become more normal. The average is 28 days not 40
    and if it lasts 3 days that is within normal. In my experience after Chiren
    treatments many women not only stop having cramps but the periods are
    shorter and lighter and they are all thrilled with that.

    Thank you, Sylvia
    We will continue with that support and I forgot to mention Viscum. Since
    she has seizures around her menstrual period (change in hormones) this
    matter is very important.

    If she has seizures you may look at the Gallbladder more closely and also
    use Atropinum.

    Yes, you are correct and we follow that. Knowing that her seizures have
    direct correlation with her menstrual cycle, we paying close attention to

I'm treating a client with Plantar Fasciitis LINK

Symptoms:
Pain in the foot along the arch (where inflammation has occurred on the tendon)
 

Treatment:
We have prescribed a Chikey and the Whiplash treatment.
Client is using Whiplash once each day.

Question:
Is there much more we could do.  
Appreciate any thoughts,m comments, ideas or experience ...

    How to treat the Plantar Fasciitis depends on the cause. The local Whiplash
    treatment alone might even be sufficient when the cause is removed, since
    in this case the cause is likely to be an external rather than an internal
    functional issue.

    Usually the inflammation is caused by overstraining of the tendon. You need
    to ask yourself what the cause of this might be. 

    It can be: Solution:
    * Wrong shoes (e.g. flat feet without proper support) => orthopaedic shoes/
    insoles 
    * Being overweight  => losing weight and exercising without foot strain
    * Standing/walking/exercising too much => resting more 
    * Wrong way of walking => therapy to improve healthy posture and movement
    * Tense calf muscles  => Gallbladder/Liver treatment

    Since muscles and tendons are controlled by Liver and Gallbladder focussing
    on these organs is important anyway. But the external cause needs to be
    addressed too and giving the feet a (complete) rest accompanied by the
    local Whiplash treatments and some stretching exercises will probably be
    the most important part of recovery.
   
    Personal experience:
    I recently experienced some wrist tendonitis due to overstrain and just the
    Whiplash treatment and some rest (and a better working posture) resolved
    the problem completely within a day. I have had the same issues in the past
    and it literally took months to heal…

    Thanks very much, Karolina ..My client is an MD so if your prescription
    works in some way, he will become a believer re. his own patients for using
    the chiren ... Dick

    One time I found Borelia hidden. Before this was discovered my Client
    didn't experience any improvement. In the Borrelia treatment she fell
    asleep. 

    Questions:
    1. How many sessions treating with Appendicitis/Tonsillitis combination is
    normal? 
    2. Is the Borrelia often found all over, or just on the Liver?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    1. It all depends on the overall ability of the Client to react to the
    Treatment, his/her Lifestyle (environmental factors, diet, stress etc.),
    but the most important factor is whether you have dealt with the underlying
    Cause... Sometimes a condition like Appendicitis is held in place because
    you have to go one step beyond that...
    So there is no standard... every situation is different.

    2. Borrelia can be found all over the body in my experience, but even if
    you find it you'll have to treat the Terrain (overall condition of the
    body) at the same time. The Borrelia is never the Cause, but more the
    Opportunistic Influence that feasts when the Immune System is down. 
    Usually there have been Traumatic Experiences in the life of Clients with
    Lyme that cause the System to be in a continuous state of Stress (Fright,
    Fight, Flight, Freeze...).

High Blood Pressure

Gylfi
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Medication Flag
Many of my clients have High Blood Pressure and take medication for this. Most
of them won't even consider stopping the medication….

Questions:
1. If I find/treat the Cause of the High Blood Pressure, shouldn't they then
automatically get Low Blood pressure? 

2. When do I know when it is safe to stop the pills? I don't want to add to the
stress of these clients because or their High Blood Pressure.  

3. What are the usual Causes of High Blood pressure? 

4. If people can't measure their Blood Pressure, how can I be sure they are OK
and don't have to use their medicines?

    Answers:
    1. Possible, but not always. If the Blood Vessels are Calcified the Blood
    Pressure stays high, so Calcification should always be solved first if you
    measure it (after the Parathyroid has been corrected!). 

    3. The causes can be a dysfunction of:  Adrenals, Kidneys or Gallbladder 

    4. When clients are not prepared to drop their medication there is no point
    in treating them at all (for this). Sometimes you can only find out if the
    Blood Pressure is regulated properly by the body again after stopping the
    medication.

    When and how to drop the medication:
    * There's no need to drop the medication before the problem is solved
    energetically! 

    * But when there's no measurable problem anymore, the clients can only find
    out that it worked when they drop their medication. 

    * Always tell them to reduce medication in phases, never let them stop at
    once.
    First reduce by 20% and then stay on this dose for at least four/five
    days. 
    Then if the Blood Pressure is still OK they can reduce 20% more (this is
    the same procedure I follow with lowering Insulin and Thyroid medication)

    * When, after lowering the dose, Blood Pressure rises (measure several
    times during the day, because blood pressure varies), then they should take
    the higher dose again and you have to find out what you're missing in the
    treatment. 

    * The Gallbladder should always be healthy when you start reducing the
    medication.

    * Especially when you treat their Gallbladder, you will have to tell your
    clients that they have to watch their Blood Pressure. It might all of a
    sudden drop (on for example a relaxed evening), and then of course they
    should stop the medication immediately.

MS in Action

ShoreenShoreen
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Hello,

Client: female, 1964, MS since 16 years, live very healthy, no medications, has
physical disabilities, 1-2 relapses in MS per year

Symptoms: muscle pain all over the body, such as influenza, feeling that it
could give a brost, she does not want cortison to stop the thrust, had major
stress privately in the last 3 months with her parents,

Measurement: 
Large Intestines (rh), 
Nervous System (rh + lh), 
Bladder (lf) – second session, 
Gallbladder (rf + lf) – second session, 
Kidneys (ureters) (lf) – second session

1st Session

> 12 Program:
Rubella, Fibroma Pendulum, Neurofibroma, Neuralgo Rheum (Nervous System),
Leptospirose, Brucella Abortus Bang (Colon), Nux Vomica  

Dyslexia Program: 
Causticum, Cerebrum, Ozaliet, Veratrum, Thalamus, Aesculus, Arnica, Belladonna

2nd Session:

 > 12 Program:
Calculi Renales (Kidney), Calculi Bil (Gallbladder), Rubella, Q-Fever (Nervous
System), Cysteopyelonephritis, Plantago, Sabal Homaccord (Bladder), Nux Vomica 

Dyslexia Program: 
Causticum, Cerebrum, Ozaliet, Veratrum, Thalamus, Aesculus, Selenium, Arnica

Results:
After the first session she felt better for 2 days then the symptoms came back.
We meet as 5 days after the first treatment for the next session. After the
second session it goes first for 24 hour worser than better for 2 days. And
than the pain came back. She now takes Cortison to stop the process.

Question:
How can I better help in a situation like this? The target is to handle the
situation without Cortison or something like this!

    I feel that there is serious Appendicitis that has not been treated.
    Especially since the Large Intestine dropped on the right hand.

    I also notice that you treat with Food Poisoning while there are no drops
    on his Small Intestine, Sinuses or Stomach. If there are no drops there,
    Food Poisoning is very unlikely.

    The Rubella might indicate that there is MS, but I think the Appendix is
    far more likely. It could still be false MS, caused by the Liver. The
    period of stress is also indicating for false MS

    I also wonder about the Vaccinations. Was she not vaccinated? I know it
    should not be a standard procedure to treat all vaccinations and you should
    go by your measurements, but in the first treatment Poliomyelitis and
    Anti-Tetanus almost always show up.

    Based on the Measurements I suspect Botulism & Appendicitis Necroticans
    (Nervous System and Intestines)

    Pain in the Left Leg and Back is unlikely to come from this, 

    You say you used Q-fever for other dropping points but which dropping
    points? You do not mention these. All Nervous system?

    Not all nervous system. sorry was not clear enough. only for the NS2 -

    bring the other nervous system points in a better energy. Thank you

    Pain in the Leg and Back is probably caused by Gallbladder or Circulation.

    Is his Left Leg as Long as his Right Leg? This could cause it as well

    I suggest you do the treatment designed to make the legs the same length.

    shorter leg: put the cable with scar connector/pad on the end of the GB
    meridian and connect that cable with the blue socket of the chiren. Connect
    the golden electrode with the orange socket and give the patient this in a
    hand. Then run the 2-7 program. This takes away the energy from the GB
    meridian which is the cause of the higher tension in the leg.

    Bend the knees a few times.

    Check the length of legs again. If they are not the same yet, repeat the
    procedure, possibly a third time.

     

    If this is insufficient, start on the longer leg. Procedure is the
    opposite.

    Connect the cable with the connector/pad to the orange socket. Connect the
    cable with the golden rod to the blue socket. Start the program 2-7. Bend
    the knees a few times before testing if the legs are the same length.

    Repeat the procedure a few times.

     

    Further concentrate on the Circulation meridian

    There are also remedies that have lower potencies and higher potencies of

     So no this wouldn't make any difference. The body takes whatever

    You can't check the MSG afterward by measuring. It is not stored by the

    It is best just not to use it.

    :-) Yes you can do that, but the outcome will be without an exception that
    it is not good.... so I wouldn't see the need to do this test except for
    showing the client that MSG is not very healthy for her Nervous System.

Copying a Remedy

 Hi everyone,

  I was in the last class here in Walnut creek and I have a question.  Could
someone please tell me step by step how to put a blank card into someone else's
Chiren and copy a remedy from that instrument.  I do not have the trichomonas
remedy and would like to input that on a card, so you can use that as an
example.

Thank you,

    Hi Nicholas,
    This is the "how to make a remedy" instruction that was sent around by
    e-mail last year with some adaption because you want to copy a remedy
    that's already in the Chiren. I've added these instructions in bold
    letters.

    * Start screen on monitor 
    * Write name of support on unused chipcard with magic marker or label 
    * Click on any of the 8 green menu bars on the left to open the next window
    on the screen 
    * Click on OWN REMEDIES (on bottom of the list in window) 
    * Click NEW 
    * Type in name of the remedy (If inverting disease causing information
    instead, make name obvious to avoid mistakes) 
    * Click OK 
    * Insert chipcard in Chiren slot (green light in front of it goes on  - the
    chip  should be facing you when you put the card in) 
    * Click OK 
    * Remove chipcard from slot 
    * Put the chipcard with chip side down on the blue light footplate 
    * Put the remedy or substance on the other footplate (or in cup) 
    * Click OK 
    * Click BACK
   
    * When you want to copy a remedy that's already in the Chiren you click
    NAME and choose the remedy you want to copy. It should now appear in one of
    the bars on the left. 
   
    * Click on PROGRAMS 
    * Click on REMEDIES (unless you are inverting negative/disease causing
    information, then click on NEUTRALIZATION instead 
    * Click START (2-minute program) 
    * Click on any green bar menu again 
    * Click on Own Remedies 
    * Click on READ 
    * Insert chipcard into Chiren again (Chiren asks you to do this) 
    * OKAY

    I've copy/pasted it below:

    Loading Remedies from Chiren onto blank chip cards
    Click on the green slots on left hand side of the screen
    Click OWN REMEDIES
    NEW
    Type in Name of Remedy
    Put in card with chip facing you until you hear a click
    Press ok

    Remove Card - Write the name of that remedy on it with permanent pen and
    place on the foot plates with chip part facing down
    Put remedy into the left hand (Green) slot - the one you want on the card
    Run the remedy program to put the remedy on the card

    Transferring Remedies already on cards into the Ciren
    Put in card (with remedy you want on it)
    Click on OWN REMEDIES
    Click READ
    Now Remedy is on the machine under own remedies.
    Remove card

    I have some clients who are coming off their medications and want to load
    the medications inverted frequency into my Chiren so I can neutralize its
    effects.  Once I've loaded the card into the Chiren I probably won't use
    the card again.  Is it possible to use the same card again with another
    drug?  Much like writing over a thumb drive?  Or would it only add to the
    existing information that is on the old card?

    You can create an inverted version of the drug  by putting the clear glass
    bottle with salted water on the footplate instead of the card. Then you can
    put this bottle inside of the Cup during standard program treatment.  You
    can add alcohol to water (1/2) instead of salt if you need the information
    to be held longer.
    What do you think?
    After you loaded information in the bottle with salt/water (alcohol/water) 
    you can not load any information on the top. If you need new remedy, you
    create it in the new bottle.
    I suspect it is the same in case of using our Cards. New crystal every
    time.
    That is how we were taught.

    I've been loading the more common drugs into my Chiren including some
    really strong narcotics like oxycodone which I don't want to keep stored in
    my office.  I also want to utilize the biofeedback feature which is not
    available when using the neutralization program with one glass rod.

    With the amount of medications that people are on, I can see that I might
    end up with lots of bottles to store.  I keep vodka in my office for
    cleaning my equipment.  If I decide to start loading bottles instead of
    cards: Do I use 50%
    alcohol and 50% water?  Or if using salt, just a pinch in a 1 oz bottle?

    Can we empty the bottles, rinse them out, and reuse them?

    I use little 1 inch bottles that I buy from www.discountvials.com (140
    bottles in the box) and I never reuse them. I usually use salt and water.
    I use alcohol and water (30/70) only when I create remedies to take
    internally (like Veratrum) and I ask people to bring their favorite alcohol
    (cognac, etc.).

    In the making of a remedy.

    a) You can use water only if it does not have to last for more than 72
    hours, after this the water won't hold the information anymore.

    b) You can just use a pinch of salt if the remedy needs to last for longer.

    c) When you use Wodka or Cognac, you use 20% alcohol, 80% distilled water

    d) I would not re-use the bottles. There is always the chance that the
    energy of the previous remedy is still there.

    e) I used to sometimes give remedy drops to patients in the early eighties,
    but I have never done it since. It is better not to give the patient
    remedies in between treatments. 

    f) Since there's no self correction (like in the Chiren, Starlight or
    Chikey treatment) when you give homeopathic information orally, you can
    even cause problems by doing this. When a remedy is not needed anymore and
    you continue to take it, the same problem that the remedy was taken for can
    be recreated.

    Johan says that Veratrum is an exception in that to get the improvements of
    eyesight you need to take it too often (3x a day).  Using the Chiren or
    Chikey 3 times a day is far too much for the body to handle so this is not
    an option.

    The only solution is indeed taking Veratrum drops.

    So to put the energy of Veratrum into liquid form I believe I would 
     1. Label a Vial with the name of the remedy.
     2. Put the vial of 80% distilled water, 20% alcohol on a footplate or in
        the cup connected to the OUT port.
     3. Select Veratrum from the Green remedy slots
     4. Run the 2 minute Remedy program.

    Questions:
     1. Is this the Correct way to do this?
     2. Do I need to add salt when using alcohol?
     3. Does the color of the vial make any difference?

         I see them available in 

          ☆ Cobalt Blue
          ☆ Clear
          ☆ Amber 
          ☆ Green

    Answers:
    1. 100% correct
    2. Only when you use water you need to add salt, not when you use alcohol
    3. The glass used for the vial is crucial. 
    Colored glass does not allow every frequency of the light to pass into the
    liquid. So the glass needs to be clear and preferably it should be made of
    quartz glass.

    What is the difference between borosilicate glass and quartz?

    discountvials.com sells borosilicate vials. 

    Below is the difference...

    There are many differences between borosilicate glass and quartz, either
    pure- or synthetic-fused silica types. The main differences are the
    percentage of compounds and the percentage of silica or SiO2 in the glass.
    Borosilicate is usually in the 80% range, while quartz is over 99%. Quartz
    is also capable of handling much higher temperatures up to 1,100° C. Quartz
    is typically used for high temperature applications, or where optical
    quality or dielectric properties are critical. Impurities in borosilicate
    glass are measured in percent; impurities in quartz are measured in PPM.

Chikey - Veins & Liver

sallydyer
December 2013 edited January 2014 in Chikey Flag
Client:
73 year old woman.

History: 
Contracted Hepatitis C from a blood transfusion 20 years ago. 

Therapies:
Has been seeing an alternative doctor for the last 7 years who she believes
saved her life. 

Medication/Supplements;
22 supplements a day 
Alpha Lipoic Acid IV Therapy 2 times a year for her Liver. 

Biontology results:
Her last doctor's appointment with all her blood work showed the most
improvement she has had in the last 4 years! She had about 7 Biophoton
treatments before the blood work was done.

Questions:
1. What are your thoughts on Alpha Lipoic Acid IV Therapy and the daily Alpha
Lipoic supplements that she thinks are very important to take?

2. Her Liver has stopped showing, should I continue to support it?

3. She has bad varicose veins. They are definitely improving but I think she
might be a candidate for a Chikey to run supports at home?
A lot of venal remedies match. Would I make a chip card with her latest
measurements and then touch base maybe once a month to see if she needs a new
chip card?

    Answers:
    1. ALA is an antioxidant that is normally present in every cell. 
    Question is: Is there a need for this, does your client not have enough ALA
    in the cells? 
    ALA functions only as an antioxidant, and there are other ways to up the
    level of antioxidants in the body. For example by eating an orange. Another
    issue is that there's a lot of evidence that too many antioxidants are
    damaging to the brain.
    I am against anything going by IV since this way excludes the metabolism.
    Anything going by IV remains toxic and will create endorphins and might
    create auto immune problems.

    2. It is unlikely that the Liver is already clean in a few treatments. If
    the Liver has gone to a
    non-showing state, it is most likely because it has gone back to
    suppressing. Possibly because the body has not detoxified but has dumped
    many toxins in the Liver, in stead of removing them from the body. 
    Another possible cause is the many supplements that this woman is taking.

    So yes, I would always support the Liver of your client.

    3. Varicose Veins are a sign that there is still a lot wrong with the
    system. There is a possibility that they have become structural and cannot
    be helped anymore.
    Varicose Veins are a sign of bad working valves in the Veins, generally
    caused by Calcium deposits between them.
    The Calcium must be removed before you start to support the Valves
    themselves. => Barijodeel and/or Aurumheel up to 8 sessions

    Another reason for Varicose Veins might be Adrenal insufficiency,
    although Calcium deposits will probably be there too.

    Fluid Retention, or a job in which standing is required are other
    possibilities. In these cases there is still Adrenal insufficiency.

    Symptomatic/supportive remedies (not causal) => Hamamelis, Mellilotus and
    possibly Apis.

    Just to clarify it would be ok for her to use a Chikey in between sessions

    calcification is gone and then run those supports at home?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    December 2013 Flag
    As long as you measure for Barijodeel on the Veins, the Support Remedies
    for the Veins will not have a lot of effect. 

    A better Chikey card for in between sessions would be Adrenal Support
    (Berberis, Selenium) and some energy remedies like Tonico (see Early
    Release Remedy List).

Child with Kidney Stone

Eelko Manderveld
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
Boy 10 years old. He and his mother wanted to try Biophoton therapy first,
because they preferred to avoid the suggested medical procedure (shock wave
 Kidney stone removal). He came for a total of 4 treatments.

Symptoms:
Kidney stones since before age 3.

Medical Diagnosis:
Ultrasound => Kidney stones (one of 5 mm and some smaller) => right Kidney

Medical Advise:
Removal by shock waves (crushing) => Total anaesthesia is required for
children. 

Biontology Sessions:
All dropping points balanced at the beginning of 4th session, including Kidney
(R).

Advise (given after the final session):
Wait some more weeks before doing a new scan.
I couldn’t believe the stones could be physically resolved so quickly, but
after some weeks I suggested the doctors should probably see a difference on
the scan (smaller stones or no stones at all). 

Results New Scan (2 month after final session):
No difference with the previous scan. 

Reflection:
I started doubting my measurements and asked him to come back for another
measurement. Still no Kidney drops.
My hypothesis is that even though the Kidney function is restored the stones
are still there without disturbing the Kidney function anymore. And hopefully
the body will take care of the stones over time.

Questions
1. Does anyone have experience with treating large Kidney stones and how long
it takes before the stones are physically gone? 

2. Does anyone have other suggestions how to explain the discrepancy between
the measurement and the ultrasound scan? 

3. Would it still be wise to do the shockwave therapy anyways or to wait and
see whether the stones are getting smaller (which means more ultrasound or
röntgen scans) or just to leave them there since they don't seem to do any harm
(but could get harmful once they enter the urinary tract)?

4. Would it help to keep treating with decalcification remedies (including
Calculi Renalis and Reneel) even if you can't measure them anymore (since all
points are corrected)?

    Answers:
    1. This is a very big Kidney stone (5mm)... it can take a while. There is
    no predicting whether the body will be capable of resolving this. My
    experience is that it will vary from case to case.

    2. Like you wrote yourself, measurement only indicates a functional
    disturbance of the Kidney system, it does not reflect an absence or
    presence of the physical stone. However, as long as there are physical
    stones present I usually do continue to measure them.
    So as far as the measurement discrepancies go, they can mean three things:
    A. Your measurement is wrong
    B. There are endorphins
    C. The stones do not disturb anymore.
    I would guess it is reason A or B.

    3. I think there is no need to do the shockwave immediately, because I
    still have hope for the stones to become smaller and also there are no
    acute symptoms that demand immediate attention.

    4. If there are already big stones like this at such young age, the child
    must have a serious calcium metabolism problem. The stones themselves are
    the final symptom but a lot of things might have contributed to the forming
    of the stone. It is impossible for stones and other calcification issues
    that are this to disappear so fast.

    In order to be able to give specific advice, I also want to know what
    symptoms the boy has/had.

    In general treating Kidney stones would be done by:
    1. Correcting the calcium metabolism (Whiplash, Vaccinations, Chronic
    Tonsillitis etc)
    2. Starting the decalcification procedure, using both Calculi nosodes,
    Baryodeel, Aurumheel, Aesculus, Reneel.
    Note: In an effective treatment approach it is essential that the Hormone
    system, especially Thyroid, Parathyroid and Pituitary, is completely
    corrected first
    3. If all points are corrected, ALL symptoms of the boy must have gone as
    well. If any symptom is still there the readings are incorrect, and then
    you have to treat according to symptoms. So treating with the remedies you
    suggested is an option.

March 2015 - Vaccination

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Q&A Flag
Question
Frequently mothers come to me with conflicting fears. On the one hand they are
afraid of brain damage by vaccinations, and on the other hand they are afraid
not to vaccinate. Their question to me is how long after every vaccination they
should wait until undoing the disturbance.

Answer
It is important to realize that not vaccinating is always better than to
vaccinate followed by treatment. It is not possible for us to see the whole
effect of the vaccination. Some damage may be permanent, especially if you wait
too long after vaccinating. The sooner the functional disturbances that are
caused by the vaccination are removed the better.

    Personally I would love to somehow get a hold of some samples of the
    vaccination that are now being used here in the States...so that I could
    make a remedy to help clear out it's damage.

    I had to be vaccinated 2 years ago, and asked if I could just have one drop
    of each on a piece of tissue before they shoot them into me, but they told
    me no. 
    I also asked if I could have the empty containers afterwards, they told me
    no. 
    I then asked if I could read the words on the bottle (hoping to remember
    some ingredients in my delirious state of panic) but they said no to even
    that.

    And how to know if those vaccins are the same in another state where I
    might find a friendly doctor to assist in purchasing these standard
    vaccins...

    I have recently been diagnosed with myoclonus. 

    Myoclonus = a uncontrolled muscle disorder that causes pulsing (not
    ringing) in the inner ear 

    History:
    Steel microclips in the jaw => for over 30 years  (in both places where the
    jawbone connects to the ear)
    Metal dental work (in my molars)
    Microwave radiation => prolonged occupational and environmental exposure 
    Menopause => third year of transitional 
    Concussion + subsequent CT-scan  => ten month ago 
    Fast-paced lifestyle (as so many New Yorkers have) => Juggling many things,
    hectic living
   
    Symptoms:
    No noticeable ear symptoms until the concussion
    The condition started out with months of => pressure + wax in the ears and
    migraines (daily). 
   
    Observation:
    Symptoms are almost always triggered by exposure to a strong WIFI source or
    a certain range of voices transmitted over speakerphone. 
   
    Question:
    Does anyone have any experience treating myoclonus? I hope to gain some
    understanding of how to go about treating with the Chiren.

    The symptom indicate:
    Migraines => Stomach (jaw) and Gallbladder meridian
    Muscle Contractions => Gallbladder

    But is the headache really a migraine? Migraines start at the side of the
    head, then quickly involving the front of the head and eyes.
    Severe headaches can be mistaken for migraines 

    The whole thing could also be caused by a chronic jaw infection. Check this
    on the Jaw point on the Stomach meridian (Kieferostis)

    You need to measure first and get an overview of the drops.

    Today, 7 days after my last self treatment I had something inside me burst
    (?) As a large amount of fluid was released on my bed (not urine). Not sure
    this is related to my myoclonus condition but an unusual development.

Mobile Phone Treatment

Barbaralee
June 2014 edited June 2014 in Questions for the H.A.A. Flag
Given the discussions around neutralization, is the protocol in the old manual
still recommended?

The manual says, "there are two ways to counteract the negative influences from
mobile phones, one is treating the phone and the other is treating the person
using it."

I did measure my client with the phone in her lap after measuring without the
phone. Prior to phone, only pituitary and parathyroid dropped. With the phone,
every single point of the endocrine system dropped. Not surprising, but so
shocking and sad given the abundance of cellphone use.

I treated the phone. No problem. But did not re-measure her after treating the
phone. My mistake realizing that now.

Instead,  I treated her as prescribed in the manual. All would have gone well,
except when I tried to call her mobile, there was no reception here, so her
rang but did not take my call. Still, she was holding the light emitting
electrode in her left hand, while the neutralization program was running with
the remedies electro-essence and causticum in the slots as the mobile rang but
did not pick my call.

Now, I'm worried I may have attracted more electromagnetic energy to her???
Because the phone did not pick up??

Thank you.

    Since the mobile phone for sure is a permanent cause of stress, there is no
    problem in using the Neutralization Program. You can apply the mobile phone
    treatment as indicated in the manual. As long as her phone rang there was a
    connection and that is sufficient.

    I am however worried about your choice to use remedies in the
    Neutralization program. This should never been done! The way you describe
    it, you have given her the opposite of Electro-Essence and Causticum… So
    this might have made her more sensitive to electromagnetic energy for a
    while….

    Please note that no remedies should be added (when treating a person) to:
    1. The Neutralization Program
    2. The Spin Inversion Program
    3. The Scar/Whiplash program (when treating according to protocol)

    Addition to point 3:
    When someone is not undergoing targeted Biontology treatment (= weekly
    sessions according to protocol), a Scar Treatment (or short Standard
    Program) with remedies can be used for symptom treatment. When giving
    remedies to the body in this way, the same rule as always applies: Less is
    more. Don't fill all 8 slots with random remedies, but be very aware of
    what you want to achieve and focus.

    When treating Scars, whether energetic or physical, there's no added
    benefit of using remedies!

    I understand that it is tempting to think that adding remedies will improve
    the above mentioned programs, but this really is not the case. 
    The remedies are only used in the Standard Hand Treatment and Footplate
    Treatment, where they do have an important function.
  •

    Thank you Karolina.
    I put Causticum and electro-esence in the slots because it says to do it in
    the manual.

    Here written per manual:
    "A person can be treated as follows; Put the phone in the remedy cup, or on
    the footplate which is connected to the in socket, add electro-essence an
    causticum in the slots. Call the cell phone and then run the neutralization
    program."

    Biontology and the Chiren are evolving through experience. In the future
    we'd put the phone on the plates, and the blue emitting rod in the left
    hand, run the neutralization program with clear slots...no remedies.

    This clinic is undergoing on-going treatments. She was a clients of Halli's
    for two months and has recently come back for more light. She has Grave's
    Disease.

    I'm really looking forward to the new manual. I know you've worked very,
    very hard to get it ready. We will really benefit from all your hard work.

    I have mainly been working on providing good information on the remedies.
    So the first thing to be released is a Chiren-remedy book.
   
    The reason for why I have left the old manual alone is that we were
    convinced that it was still the same as the first time Johan had approved
    it many years ago and that it just needed some updating, restructuring, and
    additions. But I was planning on re-writing it all together. I started with
    the remedies…. 
   
    However we recently found out the manual has been tampered with. This kind
    of information that you mention definitely does not come from Johan, but
    from someone who does not understand how Neutralization works. I have
    access to the original manuscripts and have seen that the original manual
    is completely in line with what we are teaching right now, just as Johan
    always assured me. The texts in original manual are more limited than the
    information we are now providing in the training and on the forum, but all
    is completely in line with the way Biontology is taught right now and has
    been taught in the past.. I now can understand that many of you were
    confused about discrepancies. I just never realised the manual itself had
    been "polluted"... 
   
    It really is a mystery how this could have happened, since there was just
    one file that was sent around in a digitally read-only format… Johan never
    suspected someone to change things in the manual without his consent, so he
    never checked anymore when they were sent out.
    I tried to find the first diversion from the original, but I think it goes
    way back. 
   
    Anyway, I have been working around the clock to get all the errors (strange
    additions and changes!) out of the technical part of the manual and this is
    going to be sent around soon. Right now I've started to update the more
    therapeutic parts too… The phone treatment is part of that… In the original
    manual this treatment was not even mentioned, so someone else included it.
   
    If changes would have been made consistent with Biontology (and with reason
    for that matter!), this would not have been such a big problem. But I must
    say I am quite shocked about this text that encourages to put remedies in
    the Neutralization program! 
   
    Thank you so much for bringing this to my attention… I wonder why it has
    never come up before. Inverting remedies is not a very logical thing to do.

    This has nothing to do with Biontology "evolving through experience". 

    If one would understand that Neutralization means inversion of information,
    one would never choose to use this program with a remedy that is also used
    in the Standard, direct, program. But of course when something is put in
    black and white in an instruction manual this might be accepted without
    much wondering, and the thinking mistake is then easily overlooked… I
    certainly don't blame anyone for this except for the one who made the
    changes without my consent.

    Now I know the manual has been changed without my knowing, it is easier to
    understand why some people have adopted strange practices. And also why
    some experiments were taken out of context, and were adopted as a general
    practice. Notes were never supposed to be in the manual for example. I have
    experimented with them… that's it. I would only add something to the
    Biontology protocol when it shows to be an improvement in practice, and
    this very rarely happens to be the case. Usually adding things only means
    distraction from the core-essence of Biontology.

    The Chiren Remedy book (which I believe came straight from IABS?) lists
    nododes but no symptoms like the old manual. I refer to both at times
    mostly because of the more comprehensive list of homeopathy etc. after the
    nosodes. I'm looking forward to a more complete version, and read a sample
    of that work here on the forum.

    I can't possible understand either the issues of manual distortion or
    adaptation that you're both now feel has taken place. 

    My own simple thoughts when I put those specific remedies was they
    neutralized electromagnetic fields making the fields benign to the body.

    Now that we know I've performed incorrectly based on the manual, let's get
    back to the client's well-being as the phone and these fields definitely
    affect her health. Please review my original note written on her behalf and
    help me to make what I've done better for her. Did I neutralize the phone
    right? The text says, "the treat the phone you put it in between te
    footplates and run the 2-8 (btw there is no 2-8 its 2 - 7) years program.
    This will neutralize the negative effects of your mobile phone for up to
    two or three months."

    How can I undo any harmful affects running the program incorrectly may have
    caused?

     I found the process of measuring her triple warmer points before and after
    having the phone in her lap to be extremely helpful in educating about
    EMF's and how they impact the body. So there was some good received from
    the process.

    Thank you and Good luck. Barbara

    Hi Barbara,

    The Chiren remedy book is currently being prepared for printing. Every step
    that needed to be taken after finishing the writing, took longer than I was
    expecting… 

    Here is an example of how the Nosodes are described: LINK

    Your thoughts that Electro Essence helps neutralise the EM effects is
    completely right. Causticum on the other hand is a remedy that helps the
    body recover from damage done by radiation. 

    But ask yourself what happens when you neutralise something that is
    neutralising in itself? 
    Answer: It becomes the opposite from a neutralising remedy. So that is not
    desirable at all.

    To put things in perspective, giving this information to the body will only
    have a temporary adverse effect. You could compare it to giving someone a
    homeopathic remedy that is not compatible. If your clients didn't
    experience any adverse effects afterward I would not further pay attention
    to it. 

    Treating the phone itself is something completely different, and is done by
    putting the phone in between the footplates like you describe while running
    the 2-7 years program (no remedies necessary!).

    Your procedure of measurement with the phone in her lap, is correct and can
    indeed be helpful. 


    "I can't possible understand either the issues of manual distortion or
    adaptation that you're both now feel has taken place."

    Do you mean you can't understand how it happened? We can't either. But
    education for years has been done by others than Johan… all in good faith
    and with the understanding that the basics as Johan once taught them would
    be continued to be taught. Johan never thought the manual would have been
    "adapted" at some point. I am now comparing the old manuscript with the new
    one and will clean things up (the distortion is definitely a fact and not a
    feeling…), and I also will try to organise it a bit better. The technical
    part will be send to you soon. Diane already has it.

    Procedure of Neutralizing Cellphone Radiation 

    1. Put the cellphone on Footplate/in Biophoton Cup, connected to either
    Cup-Port or IN-port (fiber-optic)
    2. Take the blue light emitting glass rod in the left hand ("Light=Left")
    3. Let someone call you
    4. When the cellphone rings, start the Neutralization program
   
    Always make sure there is NO remedy in the green slots when you treat a
    person with the Neutralisation program! It is important to try and 
    understand why.

    Procedure of Treating The Cellphone in the hope to Neutralise Negative
    Information
    This is purely experimental and Johan does not know for sure if it really
    has an effect (he is doing this for years as a preventative, but is not
    completely convinced it makes a difference)!

    1. Put the cellphone in between the 2 Footplates
    2. Run the Standard Program 2-7 years

    Don't use any remedies in this procedure, this makes no sense. Using the
    Standard Program with filter for chaotic light will harmonise the energy of
    the phone. 
    Remedy-information you add will probably not stick anyway because of the
    biophoton filter, and if it does stick this means you have made a remedy of
    your phone. Walking around with an informational remedy all the time is not
    a good thing.

    1. Try Caustricum and Electro Essence and measure if this correct any
    points…
    2. If it does, run a 2-7 program, before or during your full treatment.

    Hi Kat, Great to hear from you! 
   
    I have another question about measuring the client with the cellphone. I'm
    confused.

    Questions:
    1. If points drop when the cellphone is in the in the lap of the client,
    does that indicate a "no" the cell isn't taking energy from the host body?
    2. If the points scream "yes" does that mean the cell is depleting the
    body?
    3. I'm confused because the cell isn't a nosode or support remedy so
    wondered if the same principals apply?
    4. Initially, I thought that the drops indicated that the cell wasn't
    compatible with the person?
  • 
    katkat
    June 2014 edited June 2014 Flag
    About your Questions:

    A cellphone is the opposite of a remedy, so i'm pretty sure it cannot ever
    make a dropping point straight!

    But make sure to measure points first to see if they don't drop first
    before putting the phone on the client, to see if it is the phone or
    something else...

    A straight point is a point that doesn't need correction, a dropping point
    is a point that needs help. Not the other way around.

    remember: a louder "screaming" point doesn't mean straight or not straight:
    straight point: can be low in sound or higher this doesn't matter as long
    as the sound doesn't change, so hold the pen long enough to hear a possible
    drop, a straight point can hold the sound pretty long in a low sound or a
    higher sound).

    So when you wrote "If the points scream "yes" does that mean the cell is
    depleting the body?"
    then I want to make sure you see the "yes / no" as in "no drop / drop" :
    the chiren/body communication works very basic like that, so a straight
    point is a point that is NOT complaining. So in this case you are
    mentioning: the point is a yes? (straight?) so the phone in her lap is not
    disturbing the points enough to make them drop.

    A point that drops is a point that is not ok, so that would be a "no" in
    language: which means there IS disturbance.
    A point that does not drops, is an "all is good here", no disturbance needs
    to be cleared right now, it is strong enough to hold.


    i personally don't do phone tests, i'm sure they are not healthy, but we
    all use them, so i just focus my time on the full treatments so the immune
    system can become stronger to battle the toxic world we live in.
    In treatment measurement it can happen that for example Caustricum helps to
    clear some drops and then I can use it as a remedy in the full treatment.

    And to neutralize phones is fun to do too of course. why not...

    Hi Barbara, what Kat wrote is correct. I just want to recap with a short
    answer to your questions.

    Answers:
    1. When a point drops with the cellphone in the lap of the client (and it
    did not drop before), this means that the cellphone disturbs your client's
    energy.
    2. When no points drop, the disturbance is not bigger than the body can
    handle. But this does not mean the cellphone is healthy of course.
    3. Nosodes and Support Remedies always have a beneficial effect on a
    disturbance when they resonate. They do not represent a disturbing factor,
    so you measure them to see what they solve. Measuring a disturbing factor
    like a toxin or cellphone is done to see what they disturb.
    4. Your first thought was right ;-)

    Thank you Karolina,

    Most strange, with one of my clients, the cellphone strengthened the
    sounds. 
    She's elderly and it's hard to hear her drops because they are low, and
    many drop. 
    But when I put the cellphone in her lap, it improved the drops!

    She takes amphetamines for AdHD, so I just wondered what's going on with a
    client where the cellphone makes the sounds better.

    Odd isn't?
    Welcome back,

    There is a difference between "strengthened the sounds" and "improved the
    drops". 
    Can you explain exactly what happened?

    a. Did the sounds become stronger so it was easier to hear the drops? OR
    b. Did almost all drops become straight lines? OR
    c. Did some drops disappear and others stay? OR
    d. …...
  • 
    Barbaralee
    June 2014 edited June 2014 Flag
    B. Is the answer. 

    Especially the Tripple Warmer drops. Also with this client, an ornate
    wedding ring (left hand) disturbs all drops on Tripple Warmer unless we
    remove it.

    Yet, it's also true that the drops became stronger so it was easier to
    hear, but they were also straight and strong where they had not been
    before.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    About the phone measurement:
    This means that the mobile phone is such a stress-factor to your client
    that the Skin Blood Flow increases temporarily (higher sounds). In the long
    run cellphone radiation decreases blood flow to the skin however and dries
    the skin out.

    At the same time the stress creates Endorphins (all drops become straight
    lines).

    About the ornate wedding ring:
    It is not uncommon at all for crystals (also diamonds) or other energetic
    objects that are carried on the body to be an extreme hormonal disruptor. 

    I have once measured a man who I had treated several times before without a
    problem, but now all points of only his left hand were dropping steeply
    (right hand was normal = some drops some straight measurements). I tried
    several things that did not work and then asked if he was carrying
    something on the left side of his body that was unusual. He did, it was a
    small card that was energised by Tibetan Lamas! When he removed the card
    everything was fine again.

March 2015 - Radionics

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Q&A Flag
Question
Radionics sends information remotely. When using the Chiren remotely this is
similar to radionics. Please describe how radionics works and how remote
treatments with the Chiren work. What is the difference between the two?

Answer
There is a big difference because the Chiren also receives information, which
it uses in a feedback loop. Radionics is only sending and not receiving. This
is also why radionics can be very destructive, as projection and desire is
usually violent.

    Questions:
    1. Does the remote Chiren treatment, with no surrogate testing, somehow
    uses a biofeedback loop when sending information to the client?

    2. Or do you mean that remote treatments in general, with either device, do
    not present a risk to the therapist and that it is only the remote 
    assessment that carries a risk?

    I know of a radionics type of devise with the following characteristics:
    a. It is a radionics typ of device based on quantum physics
    b. It utilizes a weighted number generator, and has been registered with
    the FDA for Biofeedback. 
    c. It utilizes a strap around the head, feet, and ankles during the
    assessment and treatment (and thus no Voll measurement). 
    d. It can be used for remote treatments which seems not unlike a remote
    Chiren treatment. 
   
    3. How would this type of biofeedback/radionics device present any more of
    a risk during an assessment or treatment than the Chiren would? Or is it
    not truly a radionics device?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    March 2015 Flag
    Answers:
    1. Yes. When you use the Chiren with one or two "witnesses", it receives
    information and sends information back to the client. It uses the feedback
    loop that always is present when you use the Standard programs or Dyslexia
    program.

    2. Treatments using this procedure do not affect the practitioner. In my
    opinion it is only the assessment that is risky to the therapist. However,
    treatment without a feedback loop does pose a risk for the receiver
    (client)!
    If you cannot make an assessment on which "rates" to use in treatment,
    Radionics treatments are useless. 

    3. This instrument is definitely NOT a Radionics device. Radionics devices
    are highly effective in the right hands and can also be very dangerous.
    They are banned by the FDA.
    If this device works with a different assessment method that does not
    involve the practitioner, then there is no risk for the practitioner. But I
    do not believe that this method can accurately assess a client. I have seen
    for myself when researching these type of devices, that they have random
    generators and cannot make accurate assessments of the condition of a
    person.

Facial Pain

Jennifer
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Symptoms Flag
Client
Female. 36 years old. Unmarried. Very busy and successful businesswoman.
Frequent oversea business trips. Generally healthy. Open minded and easy going.
Complained of facial pain accompanied by blurry vision and neck pain on the
right since about 10 years ago. Initially on pain medication but has stopped
long ago.

Measurement
Triple Warmer (left) - Parathyroid and 2 Adrenal points  - Anti Tetanus and
Serum Ovile
Small Intestines (left) - all except proximal point
Circulation (left) - 2 points  - Aesculus
Veins (left) - 2 points - Aesculus
Large Intestines (left) - all except proximal point

Small Intestines (right) - 2 points
Heart (right) - 1 distal point
Large Intestines (right) - all points
Nervous System (right) - all except proximal point

Bladder (left) - distal point - Cystopyelonephritis
Gallbladder (left) - all points
Stomach (left) - all points
Spleen (left) - 1 distal point

Bladder (right) - distal point - Cystopyelonephritis
Gallbladder (right) - all except proximal point
Stomach (right) - 2 distal points

Salmonella Paratyphi, Salmonella Typhi, Appendicitis and Cambylobactor Pylori
corrected all drops on Small Intestines ,Large Intestines, Heart, Stomach and
Gallbladder


Standard program : > 12 years
Anti-Tetanus, Serum Ovile, Aesculus, Cystopyelonephritis, Salmonella Paratyphi,
Salmonella Typhi, Appendicitis and Cambylobactor Pylori

Footplates Treatment:
Viscum, Thalamus and Cerebrum, Berberis, Selenium, Sabal Homacord and Mucosa.

All points balanced and her neck pain was gone after the session and she will
be back for her 2nd session this coming Tuesday.

Questions:

1. Anti tetanus and Serum Ovile corrected the Parathyroid and the Adrenal
glands. Why the Adrenal too??

2. Should I have used Mercury since she has many amalgam. And Kieferostitis for
her facial pain. 
But I was too focus on the food poisoning seeing so many drops on the
Gastro-Intestinal  tract which could also be the cause of her pain. Am I going
the right direction?

    The first I think about is if she can turn her neck to both sides . If not
    there might be a muscular block. Then I would see if the whiplashprogr/

    and I have positve result on muscular locking with that program ... FIRST

    Thanks, Beate. She has the neck pain when the facial pain comes on and the

    Granuloma denti & Kieferostitis to see if they help. Any suggestion?

    1. The Anti-Tetanus and the Serum Ovile correct the Parathyroid. The
    Parathyroid, when it is corrected, corrects the Adrenal Glands.

    2. I would not use Mercury automatically. ONLY if it happens to match on
    the nervous system, but not this early on in your treatment. First all
    elimination organs should work properly.

    Facial pain is always caused by the stomach meridian. Pain/stiffness of the
    neck is also caused by the stomach. For pain in the neck, use Anacardium
    symptomatically. But find nosodes to address the real issue with the
    stomach.

    The jaw also belongs to the stomach. The facial pain might be caused by the
    jaw, but not necessarily so.
    I think there is a stomach issue as well, because Kiefersotitis generally
    does not cause stiffness/pain in the neck

    The facial pain has eased and the vision is much clearer.

    Measurement:
    Almost all points on the fingers dropped !?? 
    Most of the stomach and gallbladder points dropped as well. 

    Treatment:
    Whiplash Treatment 

    >12 Program:
    Triple Warmer - Again Anti Tetanus and Serum Ovile  
    All other points - Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi, Bact. Coli, Bact.
    Proteus, Appendicitis 

    I tried Granuloma Denti on the Stomach meridian and the sound was much
    better. 

    Footplates:
    Thalamus, Visum (I did check if ok for the Pineal and Pituitary glands),
    Berberis, Selenium, Atropinum, Mucosa and Nux Vomica. 

     Am I missing some things that so caused so many drops during the 2nd

    Have you corrected the Pituitary with Poliomyelitis?

    And what about Chronic (Necrotic) Appendicitis/Tonsilitis? I almost find
    that, when there are a lots of drops.

    Did you check for Spin-Inversion?
   
    Just some thoughts:)

    Thanks Margit,

    The Pituitary and Pineal did not drop. The drops on Circulation and Heart
    are the last 3 distal points. Maybe there is hidden Spin Inversion. I'll
    test it during her next session. 
    I did try Appendicitis Necrotican and Chronic Appendicitis but they did not
    match, only Appendicitis matched. I did think of Tonsillitis but then all
    the 8 slots have been taken up. Should I have made Tonsilitis the priority
    over others?

I am looking for a good source of Veratrum Hommacord drops for a client who

I Tried Amazon and Rockwell Nutrition online both of whom showed it in stock

    In theory it should be. It is the same information that is transferred. I

    But I know for sure a remedy that is created this way is effective. During

Parkinson Diagnosis

TorilJelterTorilJelter
July 2015 edited July 2015 in Interesting Cases Flag
Client:
70 year old male

Main Symptoms:
Fatigue
Insomnia
Balance & gait issues

Timeline:
Hurt neck => 80's
Left hernia
Prostate cancer
Current symptoms started 10 years ago => First left sided weakness, then rapid
progression over a month until he could no longer open a plastic bag. 
Used to be left handed => Now feels more coordinated with right hand

Medical interventions:
Hernia surgery
Radiation (prostate cancer)
Amalgam fillings (Mercury)
Gold fillings
Crowns => are breaking off now

Medical drugs:
Many medications -list pending- including Dexilant (proton pump inhibitor!)
Some supplements

Medical diagnosis:
Parkinson's => diagnosed age 60

Current Symptoms:
Fatigue => severity 9 out of10 where 10 is worst
Difficulty falling asleep => goes to bed at 8pm, then it takes 1-4 hours to
fall asleep
Difficulty sleeping through the night => wakes up 2-3 times
Balance issues => high fall risk
Scar (1 inch) on left temple from falling on bed post
Scar (1 inch) on right arm
Involuntary movements arms and legs
Head shaking
Moves non stop
Memory issues
Low affect/mood

EMF exposure:
WiFi, cordless phones, Smart Meter etc.

Session

Spin Inversion treatment with blood => resolved 3 out of the 6 Spin Inversion
drops

1st Measurement:
Hormone System (L) - All points
Hormone System (R) - Thyroid point
Circulation - Cerebral + Coronary arteries
Kidneys (L+R) - All points
Bladder (L) - Trigonum, Sphincter
Gallbladder (R) - Peritoneum

Whiplash Treatment => resolved following drops: Thyroid, Adrenal Gland,
Circulation, Kidneys, Gallbladder, Bladder

2nd Measurement: 
Hormone System (L) - Pituitary, Parathyroid, Thymus, Insulin Hypoglycemic => 
Anti-Tetanus (corrects all points)

>12 Years Standard Program:
Anti-Tetanus, Poliomyelitis, Berberis, Selenium, Strumeel, Thyroidea, Plantago,
Populus

3rd Measurement:
Heart (R) - 3 middle points (will recheck next time)

Footplates:
Reneel, Solidago, Cerebrum, Viscum, Thalamus, Chelidonium, Injeel-Chol, Ignatia

Final Measurement:
No drops

Immediate Response:
Client was sitting still without involuntary movements, improved balance, able
to walk with cane instead of walker.

Suggestion to Client:
Lower EMR, and limit/avoid use of large metal ring during treatment series.
I thought client might have limited improvement due to Dexilant, so I warned
client and partner to be aware he may need less medication.

Integration:
Whiplash seems to have been a significant contributor to this clients energetic
disturbance. 
Probably brain lost energetic connection with body in 80's OR recently when he
fell and hit head. 
Focus on following protocol. 
Self correction: Should have done 2
Will do the scar treatments next time
Added Ignatia for his mood 
Could have added Circulation support before Liver/Gallbladder support, maybe
Atropinum instead of Ignatia.

Follow up in 5-7 days

Questions:
How could I have improved this session? What was good? What was bad?
Suggestions for future sessions?

    Answer:
    You mention the use of Dexilant, which is a proton-pump-inhibitor.
    Experience has shown that the use of this type of medication is often the
    cause of non-responsiveness of the physical body. Even if symptoms improve
    temporarily, the body will not restore its self-healing abilities and there
    will be no lasting results. Therefore, the Dexilant should be stopped
    completely and not just diminished.

    He could leave this medication if you treat him for the stomach acid
    problem at the same time. This means a focus on the Gallbladder and Stomach
    systems with Nosodes AND Support remedies. The Gallbladder might also be
    responsible for his Parkinson's symptoms.
    A requirement to do this most effectively is a correct measurement, and I
    observe some problems there...

    Whiplash Treatment often is the cause of many disturbances of the Large
    Intestine, Small Intestine and Stomach systems, as well as the (Para-)
    Thyroid. Drops on these meridians could have been corrected by the Whiplash
    treatment (except for the Parathyroid, because the Anti-Tetanus always
    disturbs this gland), but all the other drops that you mention being
    corrected by the Whiplash treatment, in fact, reveal a measurement problem.

    The Thyroid was already corrected by the Whiplash treatment, so it is
    unnecessary to use Strumeel and Thyroidea. Instead I would have chosen
    remedies for the Kidneys. If all the Kidney points drop as they did with
    your client, the most likely remedies you will find are the Intestinal
    Flora Bacteria. But if one would find this, then one should immediately
    question the measurements on the Intestines. Because there you do not find
    anything, neither on the Stomach. The measurements on the Intestines and
    Stomach should have been questioned anyway because there was Whiplash, and
    this will always cause problems in these systems.

    Possibly the proton-pump-inhibitor interfered with a correct measurement,
    but then you should always follow other clues.

    I did think it was odd to not find more drops on the Intestine, and I
    thought the medications were masking/interfering.

    These are the measurements I got. I have had more than one experienced
    practitioner observe my measuring and got positive feedback from both that
    I was measuring correctly. 

    Regarding the Kidneys above. There were no more Kidney drops so I couldn't
    test the Intestinal Flora. I chose to give all 4 Kidney supports.

    Question:
    If client won't stop Dexilant is there nothing that will be beneficial from
    a biophoton therapy perspective? Not even Spin Inversion treatments if
    needed?

    Having a measurement problem does not necessarily mean that you cannot
    measure. But if you find something that doesn't make sense you need to be
    able to recognise it and work around it. Also, some people are easier to
    measure then others. Some of the clients with Parkinson's I have treated,
    for example, had very dry and thin skin due to bad circulation and age...

    This is all part of Biontology. You need to be able to observe that
    something doesn't make sense according to your experience. At one point you
    will start to see when a measurement is unreliable. It is not something
    that can be taught. You need to have lots of experience, write everything
    down (measurements, remedies used, the change in symptoms...), and then
    look through your notes every time to observe correlations. 

    I know this is not a satisfying answer, but it is just what it is. There is
    a learning curve after you have learned the basics. The learning can only
    be done in practice, and your clients are your teachers that you carefully
    need to "listen" to. With "listen" I mean the observation of literally
    everything of your client... But I know that few people will be able to
    take 3 to 4 hours with their client every time, or reserve 2 hours to
    reflect on a case after the client has left...

    So this is why Johan's advise can be very helpful. Because he has done this
    work very systematically.

    Taking all of this into account, and especially the observation that the
    Kidney drops could not have been corrected by the Whiplash treatment, it
    would have made sense to treat with the Intestinal Flora along with Kidney
    support anyway.

    Answer
    Spin Inversion is an energetic phenomenon and treating this will have a
    beneficial effect even if he continues to use Dexilant, just like Whiplash
    treatment can have a positive effect. Furthermore there can be some
    symptomatic improvements as long as your client continues to receive
    treatments, but these will be temporary. The body does not really heal
    physically, but the temporary correction of biophoton coherency in the body
    will give some relief.

    5-6 hours per client biophoton session is a HUGE time commitment. Your
    comments are helpful Karolina. You and Johan make a good team. You
    complement each other.

    Question
    1. Are there any cases on the forum that Johan considers excellent in terms
    of presentation, adherence to protocol  and results? If so can you tell me
    which one? If not could you post such a case?

    2. If I continue with this client is this case in the right category?
    Perhaps it should be in the "case study" category rather than "Interesting
    case"?
  •

    Thank you, and I do understand Toril. This is what makes the difference
    between a researcher and a practitioner. Hardly any practitioner will be
    able to commit several hours per treatment, or the treatments will become
    extremely expensive to clients. 
    But I try to get all this valuable information from Johan the best I can,
    and make it available through Forum and Q&A's. It makes things easier for
    us, however, experience and reflection on what you do remains very
    important.

    Answers
    1. Because the Forum is a teaching platform most of the cases posted have
    some flaws in them, but this is just what is so great and useful to learn
    from... Certification is also not about 100% perfection, since this doesn't
    exist. The cases do need to show that there is a basic understanding on how
    to respect the body by following a logical order of addressing the
    different organ systems and how to treat safely and effectively. 
    On your request I will expand on what is needed in terms of presentation,
    adherence to protocol, and results.
   
    Presentation: I think as far as information is concerned, the way you
    presented this case is pretty good, and after the little editing I did it
    has the right structure. The danger of posting a case from someone who is
    certified is that it is then considered to be 100% perfect and mistakes
    that were made will then be copied... So I prefer not to do this. 
   
    Adherence to protocol: I believe this is just a matter of studying the
    manual very well and using it while you are treating. Many of the mistakes
    that were critical and caused people not to be certified could have been
    avoided if the warnings on page 164 of the manual "Working according to the
    Biontology protocols" had been respected in treatment... 

    Results: A client is ready when all symptoms are gone and all systems are
    strong enough to deal with disturbances themselves. This means that the
    last session there can still be some drops on the Yang Organs (acute and
    temporarily), but not on the Yin Organs. But also if a certain Yang point
    or system has been dropping all the time and still has not been balanced
    the last session you are not done yet. 
    If you take cases that are very easy (e.g. children, migraines, general
    fatigue or depression), this will be compensated for in the points. A
    successful case with a more complex pathology will of course be valued
    higher. 
   
    2. Of course this is going to be an interesting case ;-) But I do think you
    are right that it is better suited for the "Case Study" category. I will
    move it there for you.

    Oh no! This is terrible... I have not erased your sessions. I also cannot

    two sessions posted underneath THIS discussion, which still need to be
    addressed? 

    As far as erasing comments goes: 
    Only when a comment has no reference/relevance to Biontology or the
    specific session at all, I sometimes erase it (and when necessary I explain
    in private why this was done), but I never erase relevant information, let
    alone full sessions.... your sessions are as relevant to this discussion as
    they can get. The sessions are what this discussion is all about. So it is
    a mystery. I am so sorry about this, but cannot fix it.

Radioactive Iodine

m3pollack
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client: I'm working with a woman who was administered radioactive iodine orally
about 18 years ago for an overactive thyroid gland. 

Measurement:
All of her Triple Warmer was down on the left side, plus top 2 Heart and
Circulation and Vein points on her left hand.  On the right, only her Thyroid,
1 Heart point and 2 Circulation points, plus 1 Vein (all either the top or 2nd
position).  

I treated her for Spin Inversion, and the Triple Warmer (left) came up.  Her
full profile looked like this:

Triple Warmer (L - 3 top points)
Triple Warmer (R -1 point)
Heart (L - 2 points)
Heart (R - 1 point)
Veins ( - 2 points)
Veins (R - 2 points) 
Circulation (L- 2 points)
Circulation (R - 5 points!)
Small Intestine (L -1 point)
Large Intestine (L - 1 point)
Large Intestine (R - 1 point)
Lung (L - 2 points)
Lymphatic System (L- 1 point)
Nervous System (L - 1 point)
Nervous System (R - 2 points)
Bladder (L - Sex Organs)
Bladder (L -1 point)
Bladder (R - SexOrgans) 
Kidneys (L - 1 point) 
Kidneys (R - 2 points) 
Stomach (R - 1 point)
Liver (L - 1 point)
Pancreas (R - 1 point)


>12 Program: 
Appendicitis, Selenium, Staphylococcus Areus, Tonsillar Proepfe, Aesculus,
Myristica Sebifera, Anti-Tetanus, Cystopyelonephritis. 

Foot Plates:  
Myom Uteri, Hepatitis B, Glyoxal, Belladonna, Botulism, Pertussis Hepar,
Viscum 

Everything cleared except the Liver point.

Question: 
What do I do about the Radioactive Iodine?  She told me that when it was given
to her, the technician had a whole suit of protection, handed her the vial with
tongs, which had been encased in a lead enclosure and she was only wearing a
thin hospital gown. (!)

    Question: I thought we were not supposed to run the Spin Inversion unless
    ALL 6 points dropped (the 2 proximal points on both hands of the Triple
    Warmer, Heart and Circulation)? 
   
    Would Causticum be something to test for on all radiation cases?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    I do read in this case that all Spin Inversion points dropped. "All of her
    Triple Warmer was down on the left side, plus top 2 Heart and Circulation"
    (top = proximal). 

    Iodine (radio-active or otherwise) remains in the body only for a
    relatively short time (couple of weeks or months at the most) and is then
    expelled. The biggest problem that you might have to deal with now is the
    damage it has done to tissue and energetic system in the past.

    Causticum would be a good remedy for the radiation damage.

    The Thyroid would be the organ that is harmed the most, but I don't see
    that you found that in your measurements. I think you should continue with
    regular treatment and see what shows up.

    Was this your first treatment with her? I don't see Poliomyelitis....

    Also I see too many nosodes compared to the number of supports. Although
    nosodes have the biggest results in addressing the cause, the supports are
    important to assist the affected organ systems in healing. Both are
    necessary to create the best results.

    In the follow up I'd like to read more about the symptoms she's
    experiencing, since, in combination with the measurements, that is the
    guideline we need to assist you best with a case.

    If the Thyroid is not dropping and the measurement is good, could it be
    because of the medication she is taking that masks the problem? I
    understand from a friend who has hyperthyroidism and underwent the
    radioactive iodine treatment that killed the thyroid gland and now has to
    take medication for life. The doctor warns that he cannot go off the
    medication or he would die. What is the approach for cases like this?
    Thanks.

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    April 2013 edited April 2013 Flag
    Yes true. If there's a complete killing of the Thyroid, someone will get
    Thyroid medication for life... and this can mask problems of the Thyroid.
    But not all radioactive Iodine treatments result in a total destruction of
    all Thyroid tissue. It all depends on the dose. Usually the aim of doctors
    is to only kill part of the Thyroid to slow down hormone production.

    You can still treat the Thyroid when people have "no Thyroid" anymore.
    Johan has experience that when there's some tissue left, sometimes the
    organ grows back when it is treated, while at the same time the medication
    is slowly stopped. I have no personal story about this happening.... 

    Just stopping the Thyroid medication at once is indeed going to kill her.
    The gland should first regain some activity if that's still possible and
    then the way to go is always slowly. It is not without risks, so she should
    be carefully monitored.

    In the case presentation above there's no information about medication,
    symptoms and overall condition of the client. So it is hard to comment on
    that. I need more information.

    You wrote: I do read in this case that all Spin Inversion points dropped. 
    "All of her Triple Warmer was down on the left side, plus top 2 Heart and
    Circulation" --  I thought it had to be on both hands, not just the left? I
    read here that the Triple Warmer on the Right only had 1 drop, and the
    heart on the Right only 1 drop. And on the Left, which 2 points dropped? I
    just want to be so clear about this, so I don't do it incorrectly ever
    again.

    I will react to a few different issues here:

    Original question: in the first measurement and treatment that is mentioned
    here, I find it interesting that the vaccinations have not been treated. In
    the treatment there are no remedies for the Triple Warmer, while this is
    the first meridian that should be addressed.

    Radiation can affect the whole body and exposure to it once can keep the
    body malfunctioning the rest of the life unless the radiation damage/
    effects are neutralized. Causticum can be a great remedy for this. Although
    the iodine may be expelled physically, it's effect (damage that it has done
    both physically and energetically) can continue. Radiation always affects
    the blood and since the blood is in contact with the whole body, the whole
    body and every organ gets affected.
   
    TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) is produced by the Pituitary. The Thyroid
    is the receptor.
    Any organ is not just there physically but also there on the energetic
    level. That is where a blueprint exists according to which an exact copy of
    the original organ can be made. If a physical organ has been destroyed by
    whatever means, the energetic form still exists. It has been reported that
    the main reason for doctors to prescribe Thyroid medication is to prevent
    the Thyroid growing back.

    A lot of Thyroid problems are symptoms, not causes.  By treating with
    Radioactive Iodine or Radiation, a Thyroid problem will result in many
    additional problems. In these type of cases, you could find Causticum
    matching on every organ system.

    Spin inversion: is ONLY measured on the 6 points on the LEFT HAND. Right
    hand is not important as far as Spin Inversion diagnosis is concerned.

    First of all, If I had been presented to Chiren before I got Amoebae from
    drinking water in Tanzania, I would not have had to operate away my left
    Thyorid lobe, I know for sure.

    After the Amoebae, and some treatment in a hospital in Kenya, my system
    collapsed for over 2 years.
    Hyper and hypo and all kind of horrible things happened to me.I thought I
    had cancer, but it was a growing lump. I will not go into all crap doctors
    told me.....horrendous.

    Anyway, I have gone down from 100 to 75 Levaxine. I am fine, except for my
    Circulation which seems to be down .

    Thanks for sharing Beate,

    How did you experience lowering your dose of Levaxine? I think this might
    be educational to everyone. 

    Did you first feel a bit low Thyroid when lowering the dose because your
    body had to adapt by creating more hormones itself? Or didn't you
    experience such a process?

    How long have you been working on yourself with the Chiren? And are you
    still trying to lower your dose? Is this the lowest dose your body can
    tolerate and function healthily on at the moment?

    Hope you don't mind to share some of your experiences with this. Our own
    healing processes are so helpful in learning....

    Hi again. I have treated myself with chiren for at least 4/5 years. I do
    not rember exactly. Sounds mad, but I have gone up and down ... several
    times with the dosage. I sometimes forget a day in between. May be am too
    sloppy? Is this the reason my circulation is down?

    1.5 years ago I had a TIA. I was in the mountains and saw the doctor after
    a few days... I should have done it immidiarely. . I was not afraid at all
    so I stayed in the cabin during the weekend , resting. The hospital ordered
    all tests and gave me a "sack" of medications to take for the rest of my
    life. If NOT I could risk ending as a vegetable...,

    I went home and started treatment focused on circulation with 3/3/3/5/5/5
    days intervals. My cholesterol went down and I felt much better quick. The
    medications I took one week and stopped over night. because I felt it I
    needed it.

    My circulation is still a bit down, and today I had to contact a
    doctor...unfortunately!

    I have not recommended my method to anybody so far. Hope this give you a
    picture of my activites for good or bad:)

    Thank you for all of your comments.  I'm sorry I neglected to mention
    several salient points:

    1) Her symptoms:  Headaches, Brain Fog, Short Term Memory seems problematic
    at time, Spinal Compression and Chronic Pain (car accident in 2004)

    2) I was describing our 2nd session

    3) 1st session I did treat with Variolinum, Varicellen, Pertussis and
    Poliomyelitis

    Both 1st and 2nd sessions her Thyroid showed as a dropped point in the
    beginning.

    In the 1st session, I didn't treat for Spin Inversion because her top Heart
    point didn't drop, but points 2 and 4 did.  The other Triple Warmer and
    Circulation points were down.  

    Question: So, if 5 out of 6 points on the Left Hand are down, do we not
    treat for Spin Inversion?

    5 out of 6 is not a Spin Inversion so you don't need to treat for it then.

    You'll know if you've overlooked a Spin Inversion when the first hand
    treatment has no effect at all and all the same drops re-appear.

    little english.

    In retrospective I was out of my mind. Two and a half day with the
    medication made me ill. It started last night with, nausia, throw up,
    dizziness, chills, fewer, kidneypain, paralyzed, hart beat and

    Haemerrhoids are treated with Nux Vomica and Hamamelis. In this case I

    I haven't found any correlation for these (mirrored Spin Inversion-) points
    to drop.... You'll just have to find Remedies that correct these.

    Don't forget that the 6 points indicated for Spin Inversion, need to drop
    sharply in order for it to be a real Spin Inversion. So they are not normal
    drops, but energetic drops.

    Thrombosis is produced by the bone marrow you say. Is that also the case in
    Leiden/APC resistance?

    Cecilie:
    Thrombosis is not produced by the Bone Marrow, but Thrombocytes (=blood
    cells that cause blood to clot and are involved in wound healing) are....

    Activated protein C resistance (Factor V Leiden) is a medical term that is
    specifically describing a chemical dysfunction in the body that causes a
    heightened blood clothing activity, but won't necessarily always lead to
    Thrombosis... 
    In Biontology we assess and treat on a different level and take a broader
    view (less detailed) of looking at things. Even though someone has a
    heightened susceptibility to certain symptoms, whenever you treat him/her
    to function in the most optimal way for his/her body possible this will
    help prevent weak spots to create symptoms.... 

    With regard to the extra risk of Blood Clotting, in the condition mentioned
    by you it makes sense to:
    - Prevent Dehydration/Thickening of the Blood ==> Optimize Fluid Intake,
    Support Adrenals, be Careful with Detoxification
    - Make sure production of Platelets is not over-active ==> Correct
    functioning of Bone Marrow - focus on balancing Kidney and Gallbladder/
    Liver functioning.

Is there something in particular to look for when a client suffers with
anaphylactic allergic reactions?
Thank you,

    Hi Carol,
    good questions with no recepy for an answer, but I guess you know that by
    now by anaphylactic allergic reactions, the body respons spontaniously to
    an element entering the body and the immunsystem reacts immediately in self
    defence. The why ? is always the main issue, and the answer to that is
    hidden in the drops and no drops (endorphins) that you measure.

    I have not 1 or two specific elements to search for or to listen for BUT I
    would keep an eye on/ listen for drops on the circulation or the guts,
    central nerval system or lungs, resperatory system or relations to these
    elements to search for the cause.

    Is your client reacting after eating? after a sting? having problems
    breathing? what happens and when does the reactions appear or was it only
    one chock?

    what happens like vomitting? mucosa-reactions, fainting, swelling?

    The intervju of your client combined with the drops would lead you further,
    and please let me know what you measure so we can follow the case further
    into healing of hte body signal so it no more creates the immense reactions
    as anaphylactic allergic reactions are.
    If anyone else have a comment I would be glad to hear too so we can have a
    nice discussion here with more insights to the same topic

    Hi Carol,

    Since in allergic reactions histamine plays a major role, it might be
    useful to know that Causticum Compositum contains homeopathic Histamine
    D18.
    For a more specific answer to your question we need to know more specific
    details of your case.

    My client reacts after eating shellfish or salmon.  Very immediately,
    within one or two bites, her throat closes, the throat area swells and she
    can not swallow.  She has not had to use an epi-pen or go to the hospital,
    but she has this reaction every time she accidentally eats shellfish or
    salmon.

    Karolina~Are you suggesting that Causticum might be a good a treatment to
    reverse the condition in general or to give when someone is experiencing a
    reaction?

    Thank you!

    Hi Carol, I would measure on Brucelliose or even arcenicum to see if it
    matches, just for a start. something triggered it off one first time. It
    might be a food poisoning, I am not sure if a heavy metal could cause this,
    but Mercury is contained in fish.... 
    If she reacts immeditately after eating shellfish or salmon we are one step
    closer to finding the sollution. Swelling in throat so tonsillar comp might
    be a good support remedie
     
    as for the news of Causticum; I would measure her on it and see if it
    stimulates possitive where there is a drop. 

    Good luck

    fish and shellfish contain a lot of histamine. Anaphylactic shock is an
    extreme allergic reaction to something, mostly against histamine.  It could
    also happen when eating peanuts, that also contain a lot of histamine.
    Causticum contains histamine in D18 potency which means the opposite
    signal. This might help.
    Generally we do not get people in such condition. If people react in such a
    way, they are generally rushed to hospital.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    January 2013 edited January 2013 Flag
    Hi Carol, since anaphylaxis is an allergic response where histamine is the
    big trigger for the swelling, I think the homeopathic histamine (in
    Causticum Comp) can be of great assistance. It is used in many homeopathic
    formula's for allergy. 
    I think it will be good as a support. Belladonna and Atropinum are good
    remedies for the symptoms of anaphylaxis too. 
    If there wasn't any time like in acute anaphylaxis, I would use at least
    these 3.

    Thank you all!  I will try these suggestions, but I won't know if she has
    another reaction until she eats salmon or shellfish again. Her allergist
    told her she was allergic to the iodine in the shellfish and salmon.  If
    that is true, I believe I should also give her strumeel.

    I understand that Anaphylactic shock such as that derived from shellfish,
    peanuts, or even bee stings is immediate and most likely will not be
    treated by a biontologist but usually by an epi-pen or something given in a
    hospital.

    Questions:
    1. Are these types of reactions the same as any other allergic reaction,
    caused by Food poisonings or Circulatory problems that need correction or
    are there other related issues.
    2. Since Anaphylactic shock is caused by a reaction to histamines, can
    anything be done to decrease susceptibility to future attack? In your
    experience, have you found running Causticum, Apis, or any other particular
    remedies to have any prophylactic benefit?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    August 2014 edited August 2014 Flag
    Answers:
    1. Anaphylactic shocks is usually not caused by food poisoning. They are
    however common with allergies to peanuts.
    The main remedy for anaphylactic shock that we have in the Chiren is
    CAUSTICUM because it contains inverted histamine. But as this kind of
    allergy reactions are also Gallbladder related, I would also use
    Gallbladder support, and Apis is also a good suggestion.
    2. As a prophylactic one needs to antidote the cause of the allergies.
    One can also make a remedy card with inverted peanuts or shellfish and
    treat with this. In addition one could treat with Causticum.

Questions About Whiplash/Scar Treatment

    You say:

    "I hardly ever treat the back with the Whiplash program unless people
    experience pain there, then I treat the area of the pain locally to give
    some symptom relief for the client. I do this at the end of the session."

    Beate:

    1) When do you use the Whiplash Program and how often (as long as you
    measure Whiplash?) Not preventative?

    2) What do you mean when you treat the area of pain locally.....with the
    gass handles? Or orange blue pads?

    3) Treat in the end of session ? Is not the blocage to be treated, to clear
    for the treatment ?

    4) What remedie or program do you suggest for neck then?

    5) I have, since we were told it , used the glass handles for neck and head
    to clear the non physical body....

    and the others combined when needed.


    Hope I am clear enough:)? Thanks

    1) Only treat what you measure in the assessment and treatment part of your
    session. When all drops are corrected you can do some symptom treatment. 
    You can't prevent a Whiplash in the future by doing the Whiplash treatment.

    2) If there are pain symptoms in the back I use the glass rods over the
    painful area and run the Scar/Whiplash Program (no remedies!)

    3) Usually I don't find energetic scars in the back when I measure and
    treat. I correct first what I measure (always treat what you measure!) and
    then do symptom treatment like treating a painful area. Doing symptom
    treatment first might mask underlying issues.

    4) When I measure Whiplash I run the Whiplash Program. 
    When there's neck stiffness/pain there are usually Stomach disturbances and
    I treat them in the Standard Hand Program.

    5) I don't know what you mean by this. I don't know where it originated,
    but it comes from wrong thinking. 
    Since this is not part of my protocol, please unlearn it.

    5) "The wrong thinking" is in the assumption that "you first have to clear
    the non-physical". This suggests that you can either direct the energy
    towards the physical body or to the non-physical body. 
    Biophoton treatment always works directly on the non-physical body and
    thereby influences the physical body. The whole treatment works on the
    level of light and this is the non-physical!

    Separating physical from non-physical is a trick of the brain anyway. This
    is just not possible. In truth nothing is physical. There's only dense
    energy that we observe to be matter and more subtle energy that is not
    recognised by our normal senses, but all is energy and non-physical. That
    is why biophoton treatment works on all levels....

Symptoms:
Recurrent painful lumps under the skin in my armpits for years. If they aren't
swollen, then they just feel like little balls in my armpit. 

Questions:
1. Has anyone heard of/have experience with Hidradenitis Suppurativa? I think I
may have this disease. 
2. Any suggestions about biontology helping this??

    Unfortunately I have been unable to see her so it has all been remote. I
    will share my findings in case it helps anyone. It developed very quickly
    and as you suggested, she described lots of inflammation and pus. It seemed
    to be mostly around the bottom of her rear end. What I found was only her
    spleen and skin meridian dropping the first time. For the spleen I found
    both Salmonella and Carcinoma Hepatis worked and on the Skin it was both
    Melanosarkomium, Graphites and Melanom Metastasen matched. I have treated
    her many times in the past and then provided her with support for her
    kidneys and liver. Within two days she was still suffering badly with more
    appearing and a lot of pain so I broke protocol and treated her with
    Variolinum, Varicellen, Albumheel, Mimulus, Galium, Zirrhose Hepatis and
    Stretomycinium. This cleared all drops on her nervous system, liver and
    kidneys which were energetically very inflamed. Lots more support remedies
    like Aesculus each time. Two days later I had to give her 2-7 of Plumbum,
    Fringed Violet, Elm and Larch. She wouldn't send me a picture. She turned
    black and blue in places. This lasted over several days with deep open
    wounds and likely deep scarring. Pretty scary. She just went on antibiotics
    to finish clearing it up. My astrology friend confirmed in her chart that
    it was an extremely challenging set of planets that coincided with this,
    but to pay attention as more of the same is on its way in a few months.
    Very scary for a Mom hundreds of miles away! Feel free to correct me but
    please know that I am a very sensitive mother who has already come very
    close to losing a child so obeying the rules was the last thing on my mind.

    Hi Jennifer,
    So sorry to read about your daughter's discomfort...would like to help find
    more insight, but it's difficult to help without enough information...do
    you remember where you measured drops...what meridians were clear...etc.?
    When you write "What I found was only her spleen and skin meridian dropping
    the first time" do you mean the first time you measured, no other meridians
    dropped? Or you mean those meridians only dropped the first treatment you
    gave her and not any treatments after?
    And what does it mean "nervous system, liver and kidneys were energetically
    very inflamed"??
    Was the Hormonal System all cleared? Kidneys were not yet...Intestines/
    Circulation etc. any sidenotes still available?
   
    Without knowing which meridians dropped there is so little to suggest, but
    I'd like to bring you to the understanding that, especially being a
    sensitive mother, the protocol is there to help you make your treatments
    most effective and safe. Your guide in times of worries!

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    June 2015 edited June 2015 Flag
    Hi Jennifer, I do understand you are scared... and that is just the thing
    that makes it impossible for you to surrogate measure objectively on
    yourself. The treatments seem very chaotic and don't give improvement. So
    you are on the wrong track, and what you did obviously didn't work or
    possibly even made things worse because of diversion from protocol. You
    don't want the body to dump more toxins in the skin because the Kidneys are
    overburdened by the extra detox you initiated by treating the Liver and
    with Heavy Metals while the Kidneys are not ready yet...

    Without a good idea of what the skin condition looks like it is very hard
    to say what is going on. I can only say what I suspect and that is that
    there is likely an underlying problem with the Kidneys, Circulation, and
    Lymphatic system. This in turn causes toxicity and lack of immune function
    in the skin, causing sensitivity to infection or sterile inflammation.
    Focus on all the systems that you have been focussing on is then a waste of
    time..

    Most effective would be measuring and treating in person of course, but
    since you can't, I suggest treating with the following based on the
    assumption that there is a bacterial cellulitis possibly caused by
    intestinal flora bacteria (location!) or Strep or Staph:

    Hand Treatment:
    Staphylococcen
    Staph Aureus
    Streptococcus Haemolyticus
    Streptococcus Viridans
    Cystopyelonephritis
    Appendicitis Necroticans 
    Bact Lactis
    Bact Coli

    Footplate Treatment:
    Belladonna
    Solidago
    Berberis
    Lymphomyosot
    Circulo
    Aesculus
    Bact Pyo
    Bact Proteus

    Preferably you make two Chikey cards and send her your Chikey with the
    cards and instructions.

    Treating with Liver nosodes and Heavy Metals while the Kidneys are dropping
    during initial measurement is not safe.
    Bush and Bach remedies will do nothing for the inflammation.

    This is excellent advice, thank you Karolina. Thank you also for
    understanding the huge anxiety and nervousness that I felt - much of it
    relayed by my daughter herself. To answer the others' questions, all of her
    other systems like hormonal were clear, so in that sense, I did follow the
    protocol in terms of order of treatment. I obviously made some poor choices
    after that, however. The best thing is that a brand new Chikey arrived for
    her on Friday so I can make up some new cards as advised for a possible
    relapse, but also some regular ones to keep her system flushing well in the
    meantime. Thank you again.

    That's great news :) 

    Just like to make sure that everyone understands that, within a treatment,
    besides the Hormone System, the Kidneys are important to be clear before
    other meridians get focus ...then Intestines (Intestinal Flora) ...etc. and
    Liver last...

    There is a very important reason for this, because if you use Liver
    nosodes, or Heavy Metals, before the hollow organs are clear, symptoms
    could easily get worse with treatment...

    I have personally experienced this...and feel the need to warn you about
    the importance of the sequence in the protocol...but it is not only about
    the danger, it really changed so much for my results!
    I am now very careful with Liver nosodes, and always make sure Kidneys/
    Intestines/Circulation etc. are all clear so the body is ready to clear the
    Liver toxins without them getting stuck.

    Love to you and your daughter!
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    June 2015 edited June 2015 Flag
    I think that what Kat refers to is this:

    Jennifer: "....Galium, Zirrhose Hepatis and Stretomycinium. This cleared
    all drops on her Nervous System, Liver and Kidneys..."

    Which shows that the Liver was treated while the Kidneys were still
    dropping. Usually this is not a good idea.
    There is, however, a nuance to this because when someone has been properly
    treated many (10+) times before and does not have/had serious Kidney or
    Liver malfunction, the detoxification that has occurred over the course of
    these treatments is already so much that the risks are lower... But focus
    according to protocol will still be the better choice as to get the best
    and quickest results.

    You always need to make an overall assessment of the complete situation
    because, for example, in case of wrong treatment, 10+ sessions may not have
    done much at all... or when there is serious Liver illness, detoxification
    may go slower... or with serious Kidney disease it may also take much
    longer before you can start with the Liver or Heavy Metals.

    Kidneys had never normally been an issue for her, and of course I always
    included them when I successfully treated her for Hepatitis C, which has
    been gone for a couple of years. This condition seemed to come out of the
    blue because she has been mostly healthy.
    Moving to New York has obviously added extra stress to a sensitive system
    that probably needs ongoing care. She had one more minor outbreak about a
    month previously. This  one was much worse. When I treated her for the
    spleen and the skin, despite supporting the kidneys, it must have stressed
    them because they were dropping the next time. I struggled to find a remedy
    to clear them first, while looking for a cause, I checked the liver and the
    Streptomycinium fixed all of the drops including the kidney , so I went
    with it. I  supported the kidneys again, but ultimately I'm not sure it
    really helped. There were obviously mistakes made. I like the protocol that
    you wrote for her and I feel more calm and confident now that she has a
    Chikey..
    One last possibly ridiculous or significant comment..her roommate used to
    get something a little like this but once she stopped taking her clothes to
    the dry cleaners, it has never returned! In Toronto, we always only go to
    an eco-friendly cleaners so she will be doing the same now too. Thank you

    would find, Karolina! Circulation, lymph and kidneys. She said she had the
    best sleep in months after it. Her Chikey arrived and I made up a couple of
    cards for her in case the same scenario pops up again. When I get more
    cards I will make a more generalized support one. Thank you again for your
    help and thank you Kat for offering to see her. I will keep that in mind.

Travel for Biontology Sessions - How to Respond

DennisOwensDennisOwens
March 2014 edited March 2014 in Biontology Business Flag
I received a request for a woman with rheumatoid arthritis willing to travel
from Bulgaria to perhaps London for treatment.
She hasn't much money, but has friends, she would be raising funds from her
network.

Symptoms:
Very gnarled hands

The woman needs answers to the following
Questions:
1. Can you give an estimate of time necessary to arrange for accommodations
from friends etc. to consider her budget?
2. Can her condition be truly helped by Biophoton work?
3. What sort of success rate has there been with this? 
4. Could rheumatoid arthritis be something that would require long term use of
a Chikey after basic Chiren treatments have been done by a Biontologist? 
5. Do you have a recommendation for a practitioner in or near London,
preferably one who may have experience with rheumatoid arthritis? (I would not
be doing the treatments)

I would appreciate advice on how to respond to this request.

    * Generally Rheumatism and Arthritis care caused by under functioning
    Kidneys which do not take Uric Acid out of the Blood. 
    * The Blood dumps the Uric Acid then in places that are as far away as
    possible from the vital organs in the torso.
    * The fault in the Kidneys could be caused by Bacteria or by Exhausted
    Adrenals. 
    * Bacteria could be there because of a Digestive System that does not
    function properly 
    * Exhausted Adrenals could have been caused by a Lifestyle that spends more
    energy than there is. It might also be caused by Spin Inversion. 

    So there is a lot to be investigated before anything can be said.

    Answers:
    1. No. 
    It is not possible for me to estimate the number of treatments that could
    be necessary. It is her body that has to do the healing and I have no idea
    in what state her body is. 
    This answer applies to ALL questions about the number of treatments needed
    for a certain condition. We don't treat conditions, we treat people and
    results and the number of treatments needed depends on many factors…
   
    2. Biontology can really help. But I do not know whether the problem is
    still a functional problem or whether it has turned into a structural
    issue. In the latter case it will take a lot longer or might not work at
    all. This can only be assessed by a Bionotologist, perhaps after a few
    treatments. These treatments are necessary in order to establish the
    regulation capabilities of her body.
   
    3. I can only speak of MY success rate and that has been 100% with these
    symptoms. I have done this often. The most recent case was helped in just
    two treatments, but she was young (25) and the condition had not been in
    existence for a very long time. 
    Rhematoid arthritis is not a disease but a symptom that appears as a result
    of a Kidney problem that is caused by other problems. One needs to address
    all the causes in order to have a permanent solution.
   
    4. If certain problems are not solved completely during the course of the
    sessions, then extra treatments with the Chikey could be helpful. 
   
    *In the case of serious hardening of the Arteries, then extended treatments
    are advisable in order to eliminate the Calcium from the Blood Vessels
    completely. 
   
    * Also in the case of continuous Spin Inversion due to her situation at
    home or work place, there might be a necessity to treat this phenomenon
    repeatedly. 
   
    * The Chikey could possibly also take care of the Pain and possible
    Whiplash that could be responsible for a lot of Digestive Problems. 
   
    * Jaw problems that might not go away by normal treatments, might also be
    an indication to use the Chikey.
   
    Of course it would be better to find and eliminate the Cause...
   
    5. We have two practitioners in London. You can find them on our
    practitioners list. Anouk is the most experienced of the two. LINK

    Thank you Karolina! 

    When making a liquid remedy in the Chiren:  Am I correct in understanding
    that the substance needs to go into the INPUT SOCKET (via a footplate or
    cup).  And that a remedy can't be made by using the CUP PORT?  I think you
    previously covered this on the forum but I can't find it.  Sorry to make
    you answer this twice. :)

    Hi Renate,

    You can use either socket. When you run a program both sockets will be used
    as input inside the Chiren.

    However with measurement, only the cup port is connected. There has been
    the misunderstanding that you can use the regular input socket when for
    example you want to surrogate measure.

    Karolina :
    I am confused by your comment that both sockets will be used as imput into
    the Chiren. I understood that the right hand brought the  light into the
    chiren and then after it was either amplified or inverted, then  sent back
    on the left hand fiber optic cable. What exactly do you mean by "both
    sockets willl be used  inside the Chiren? 
    Also, I am not  clear about the meaning of the second sentence of your
    explanation also. Any further explanation would be greatly appreciated.

    Hi Richard,

    My comment about "both sockets" does not involve the regular Output Port.
    It is an answer to Renate's question as to what is the difference between
    the Cup Port and the regular Input Port in measurement.

    * Both Cup Port and regular Input Port are input ports
    * Only one is connected in the measurement circuit and that's the Cup Port
    * Both ports work as input in the treatment circuit

    I hope this makes it understandable.

    For the Body:
    Left hand is an "Input port"
    Right hand is an "output port"

    For the Chiren":
    Blue light is an indicator of the output (from Chiren) port and Yes, the
    light of your body goes to Chiren from your right (output port) hand in
    Chiren's input port.

QXCI Therapy

A close friend in Canada, with many health issues, has begun treatment using
QXCI Therapy. I had suggested she try Biontology, but there were no
practitioners near where she lives. I'm wondering if anyone has heard of this
treatment method.

    There are various biophoton practitioners in Canada, but none of them is
    certified.

    I once researched the effectiveness of the diagnostic systems of, among
    other devices, the SCIO. This system is just random and incapable of making
    an accurate diagnosis. It has been developed, just like others, to make the
    assessment easier for the practitioner, but it does not work.
    The treatment system is equally non-effective.

    Furthermore, over the years I have only heard of negative experiences with
    this QXCI therapy (no effect whatsoever).

Pregnancy - Can I Treat?

Beate
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Contraindications Flag
Is it safe to treat with Chiren before, during and/or after pregnancy?

What age before a baby can have treatment?

I have said no , since I thought of too much toxins for mother and child.

    It is really ok to treat in the pregnancy but I would not do it until after
    the first delicate 3 months to be safe. This is a crucial time.  
    Sometimes the mother would need a treatment so no complication come later
    becouse of stress, food bacteria or somthing else. 
    I treated my wife all the pregnancy, the baby liked it. Did sleep often
    really well over the night.

    Just don't overdo it, no heavy treatments.

    At our training Johan said that it is safe and the result is a very easy

    He said that the babies just pop out during labor. Treat the mother as
    protocol calls for. What I've been doing when all points are clear is using
    the aura remedies to increase immunity and keep people healthy.

    I would assume that by the time breast feeding comes along the toxins will
    be out of the mother's system if she was treated during her pregnancy and
    thus not an issue.

    The aura remedies that I use are Ozaliet, Friged Violet if there are holes
    in the aura, Crab Apple, Space Clearing Essence. Causticum if person is
    exposed to radiation as most of us are these days.

    I rarely use Bush and Bach. I only do in this instance for aura
    strengthening.
    Sometimes I add Little Flannel Flower if the person seems to have
    difficulty connecting to their inner self.  

    I think that the Busch/Bach is known to at times mask conditions so I go by
    the protocol and not use it unless it is a treatment to build the aura and
    after they have cleared their main complaints.

    I don't have a "usual" way of doing it. If I am strictly running the aura

    What do you mean by "no remedies at all" in the Footplate Treatment?

    All remedies are information and will give the body an impulse, so to be

Seizures

sallydyer
March 2014 edited March 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
12 year old girl, Anna. She's is a swimmer and a Nordic Athlete. She trains
about 8 hours a week doing cardio exercise.

Symptoms:
Epileptic seizures => started when 9 years old
1 or 2 seizures a day in the beginning => now 6 to 9 a day

Medical Specialist:
Specialist was not able to improve condition.
Doctors have said that exercise is good for her.

Medications:
Ethosuximide
Keppra => in the process of weaning her off of Keppra, since it didn't give an
improvement.

At one point she was on 4 medications which made her have more seizures.

Session1

Whiplash Treatment 

Pituitary gland - Poliomyelitis
Parathyroid - Anti-Tetanus
Insulin hyper/hypo - Biliary Cirrhosis
Adrenals- Selenium and Berberis
Pineal /Thyroid- Pertussis
Kidney's - cleared with Vaccines
Circulation - cleared with Gallbladder remedies
Small Intestines both sides ( 3 points each) - Salmonella Typhi, Salmonella
Paratyphi
Large Intestine (R) - Tuberculinum
Large Intestine (L) - Toxoplasmosis
Lymphatic System - cleared with Food Poisonings
Heart - still have drops
Lungs - still have drops
Stomach - cleared with Food Poisonings
Liver - cleared with Food Poisonings

>12 Year Program:
Polio, Anti-Tetanus, Pertussis, Salmonella Typhi, Salmonella Paratyphi, Biliary
Cirrhosis, Tuberculinum, Toxoplasmosis

Footplates:
Atropinum, Chelidonium, Selenium, Berberis, Nux Vomica

Session 2

Whiplash Treatment

Pituitary - Varicellen
Parathyroid - Serum Ovile
Pineal/Thyroid and Insulin points - Varicellen
Adrenals - Selenium and Berberis
Small Intestine (L) only 1 point 
Small Intestine (R) - High Endorphins
Large Intestine (L) - 4 points - Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis
Large Intestine (R) - all points - Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis
Tonsil Point - Chronic Tonsillitis, Tonsillitis
Circulation - 3 points- cleared with Appendicitis
Nervous System - High Endorphins
Lungs - (R)
Lungs (L) - High Endorphins
Gallbladder- cleared with Appendicitis
Stomach- cleared with Appendictis
Liver (L) cleared with Appendicitis 
Liver (R) - High Endorphins

Kidney and Bladder not dropping and did not have the high sounds

Footplates:
Chelidonium, Anginheel, Tonsillar Comp, Selenium and Berberis

Results After session 1:
Day 2 => Seizures much worse => had to come home from training. 
She did not train all weekend.
Day 3 => back to her normal amount of seizures. 
Day 4 => she came back to me and had a better day => 2 seizures

Advise I gave her:
Keep track of her seizures daily and especially on training days => told that 
excessive exercise is very stressful for the Gallbladder. 
I think they were surprised because her doctors have said exercise is good for
her.

Questions:

1. Could Anna's seizures be worse because of my treatment or maybe the detox? 
I did only use 8 nosodes but maybe that was too many for her?

2. On session 2 I started to address the Appendicitis. She also measured for
more Food Poisonings but I was afraid to put too many nosodes in. Should I have
addressed the Food Poisonings at the same time if I had room? The Appendicitis
would clear those points.

3. The Appendix nosode cleared the Gallbladder but if I took it out, Biliary
Cirrhosis would clear the gallbladder point as well. 
I did not run Biliary Cirrhosis because I wanted to make sure I was not
overloading her. I have not had a client before her suffers from daily
seizures.

4. Anna has been a swimmer for a long time so I am sure the Chlorine is a
disturber as well.

5. Anna's hands are sweaty. In session 1 she measured for Tuberculinum and
Toxoplasmosis .
I have found that those nosodes can take a few sessions to clear. 
Should I have concentrated on those with the Appendicitis and the Gallbladder?

6. Would it be helpful to try to treat Anna every 4 days, maybe Monday's and
Friday's?

    General comments:

    I believe you have some misunderstanding around High Endorphins. There are
    no high sounds when there is an excess of Endorphins. The "high" in
    Endorphin High is only a reference to the "high" that one experiences, just
    like you can experience a high from drugs… It has nothing to do with high
    pitched sounds.
    There has been a lot of discussion about this in earlier posts...

    Because of the confusion we no longer use Endorphin High in Biontology
    terminology, but call the situation Endorphin Mask, which hopefully will
    cause less confusion.

    About the Case:

    The daily exercise is too stressful for her body => drains her energy =>
    for sure the reason that her Adrenal glands still drop => Adrenal
    exhaustion is the reason for the Gallbladder imbalance => causes
    Seizures...

    I think that if she wants to get better, she really need to stop the
    exercise routine (at least at the moment)

    Be sure not to overlook Jaw or Stomach problems, since they aggravate
    Seizures => check Kieferostitis and Granuloma Denti on the most proximal
    points on the Stomach meridian.

    If there is Appendicitis and both the Large Intestine and Small Intestines
    are dropping, I would definitely go for Appendicitis Necroticans. 

    When there's Appendicitis, usually the Intestinal Bacteria travel
    everywhere => causing many infections (causing many drops as is the case
    with your client) 

    Both Appendicitis and Tonsillitis can cause drops all over the body.

    Answers:

    1. There can be several reasons:
    * Suppression is lifted and symptoms show themselves more severely =>
    increase in seizures
    * Not enough rest after treatment => healing takes a lot of energy, which
    already is a problem for her
    * Not enough good quality water to support detoxification
    * Stress caused by the exercises
    * Chemicals in the pool 
    * You have treated with Chronic Appendicitis, while Appendicitis
    Necroticans was needed
    * Other stress factors….

    What you need to do is calm the Gallbladder and at the same time increase
    the strength of the Adrenals.
    But a very important point is also the Appendicitis and the Bacteria that
    normally inhabit the Intestines.

    2. No, you did the right thing by focussing your attack on the
    Appendicitis, but I would have tried Appendicitis Necroticans instead. I'm
    almost sure this is needed for your client.

    3. Appendicitis can cause Cholecystitis/Biliary Cirrhosis as your case
    clearly shows. This has happened either energetically or by the Intestinal
    Flora that has escaped from the intestines.

    Although the Intestines would not accept the Bacteria at this point in
    time, treatment with the Intestinal Flora could improve the situation a
    lot. It could eliminate a lot of Infections in the body. 
    If the Intestinal flora Bacteria are the cause of the Gallbladder
    disturbances, it could even eliminate the Seizures. But the seizures are
    symptoms… 

    You must treat Causes first. Sometimes there is re-infection by the Causes
    so then you have to treat both systems at the same time => So treat the
    Appendicitis and the Intestinal Flora at the same time. Then worry about
    the Gallbladder...

    4. The Chlorine could definitely be an additional stress factor but it
    should not be your main focus. The serious Infections everywhere in the
    body seem to be a real Cause. It can make her more susceptible to the
    negative effects of Chlorine.

    5. Yes, I would advise you to focus on the Appendicitis and Tonsillitis
    first, then the possible Diverticulosis and the Intestinal Flora. 
    The wet hands could be an indication for Tuberculinum, but could also be
    indicative of a Kidney problem, which did not show but there might be
    Endorphins (again Endorphins give normal straight measurements!). 
    The kidney problem is likely also caused by the escaped Intestinal Flora,
    which from my experience seems very plausible in your client's condition.

    6.There are only 7 days in the week, so treating every week on Mondays and
    Fridays would be OK for one week but those days are not suitable every
    week, You could do every 4 days but I do not think it would add anything.
    She mainly needs lots of rest and learn to listen to her body!

    Thank you for such a detailed response. I learned quite a bit from this. I
    did not know that Jaw or Stomach problems could aggravate seizures.  

    Thank you for clarifying an Endorhphin Mask.

    Questions:

    1. Is it possible that the really high sounds I was hearing on many
    meridians could indicate an infection in the body? or maybe stress on the
    body?

    2. You mentioned to focus on the Appendicitis and Tonsillitis first, then
    possible Diverticulosis and Intestinal Flora. Does Appendicitis cause
    Diverticulosis? Should I not measure for Diverticulosis until the
    Appendicitis is gone?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    March 2014 edited March 2014 Flag
    Answers:
    1. The whole idea of high sounds comes from the observations made with a
    High Pressure Probe (Voll measurements). 
    With the high pressure probe of Voll's instruments you'll have to press to
    a deeper level to get a measurement and there won't be any drops ever. So
    the whole measurement system is different!

    Even when you would measure high sounds with the Voll measurement system,
    they would be limited to points connected to the acute infection/
    inflammation and would rarely show on more than one or two points and
    especially not on all these different systems at the same time. 
    However, we can not imitate the Voll measurements with the Chiren! 

    We work with the Low Pressure Probe of the Chiren, that is very sensitive
    and needs very little pressure. If we press too hard the measurements are
    useless. 

    When you have a high sound, what you need to do is lower your pressure
    because what you are actually doing is pressing through the level of
    accurate measurement so you might fail to detect the drop that is actually
    there.

    Note: Maybe the observation that these high sounds don't drop is the reason
    why some therapists have adopted the false belief that the high sounds
    reflect endorphins. But what should have been the conclusion is that one
    has pressed through the point and needs to apply less pressure.

    It is important to be aware that different skin types and locations need
    different pressure. Different levels of pressure might be needed on
    different points of one and the same client. Pressing too hard easily gives
    a high measurement. Liver points for example almost always sound high.
    Moist or irritated skin also gives high readings. You also need to be aware
    of damaged skin (cracks, wounds, burns, bruises, scars, too much measuring
    etc.). 

    Only on very, very rare occasions a high measurement in absence of the
    above factors can reflect infection/inflammation. But this will only affect
    one or two points and the graph will almost go through the roof. 

    2. In my experience, the body frequently asks for Diverticulosis after the
    Appendicitis nosodes are not measured anymore, never before. 
    Usually this remedy only matches some points of the Large Intestines (R).
    Other points might ask for Intestinal Flora.

Vaccinations First Treatment

MarietteKochMarietteKoch
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Biontology Insights Flag
I would like to be certain about the first treatment. I was told to put all
vaccinations in the slots at the first treatment, but sunday at Rotterdam I
heard that that is not the way. 
After Whiplash and Spin Inversion, you measure the Triple Warmer points and if
they drop, you put vaccination remedies first to correct and continue to
measure the body.
is this correct? Thanks.

    Hello Mariette,

    This is correct.

    It is not right to put all Vaccinations/Childhood Diseases in at the same
    time without measuring. You should only treat what you measure, so if you
    find drops on the Triple Warmer, you try them one by one and only use the
    ones that you need. 

    However, Anti-Tetanus and Poliomyelitis are the ones that you always need
    to use (when vaccinated), since you will find they are always measurable
    when someone received these Vaccinations. In the rare cases you don't find
    them right away you can be sure there's Suppression (Endorphins).

    All is explained step by step in the Measurement Protocol that Johan send
    out.

Neutralizing Presciption Drugs of a Client

slevarekslevarek
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Medication Flag
I want to be sure I am understanding this correctly.

When a person has been or is on pharmaceutical drugs when the come to your for
the first time. For me, it was very difficult reading the points..even after
whiplash and spin inversion session. 

After neutralizing the main drugs which she was taking, I was able to read her
points so much easier. 

My question is..with every visit.. do we need to clear the drugs again? How can
we get results if they stay on these drugs.. AND they are major drugs.. for
diabetes, blood pressure, sleeping pills, antidepressants.. etc..all for one
person.

Advice with this is definitely welcomed.

Thank you

    No don't neutralize drugs that are still taken. Work with what you do
    measure....

    This subject is covered in several places on the forum:

    http://www.biontology.com/vanilla/index.php?p=/discussion/7/
    allopathic-medicine-in-biontology#Item_15

    http://www.biontology.com/vanilla/index.php?p=/discussion/comment/405#
    Comment_405

    "As long as chemo is administered you should work with that situation,
    which unfortunately is the reality for now. If you would neutralize the
    chemo this will give a reading which is misleading, since the body still is
    continuously going to be burdened by the same toxins after the treatment.
    Your session is not going to prepare the body for that if you don't include
    the chemo as an influence in the body.

    So it is best to work with this reality of continuous toxicity and find out
    which (detox) remedies help the body to detoxify and balance itself while
    using chemo/medication and then, when the chemo is no longer given to her,
    you can neutralize it just once."

    Thank you,
   
    I mean difficult because all points were dropping.. I following
    the protocol of measuring the TW meridians first thing.. of the left hand.
    the 2 points  Pituitary and Para-Thyroid, then I measured then the right
    hand.. for the Thyroid.. all dropping..So I performed the WHIPLASH
    treatment.. 
   
    Then I measured the 2 points of the Heart Meridian.. and still they were
    dropping.. So then I gave the Spin- Inversion treatment.. 
   
    Back to measuring.. and still drops. 
   
    The client had all the prescription drugs to show me what she has been
    taking.. I understood that these could have been the cause of not being
    able to read the points. Therefore I neutralized the main ones which she
    has been taking daily.. some twice a day.. 
   
    And after that .. I started to get readings without drops. Now if you say I
    should not do that.. I would like to know what the next step would be when
    all points are dropping.. after both the  Whiplash and the Spin-Inversion
    treatment?

    Hello Sandra,

    If the whole body shows drops, it always means low grade infections/
    inflammation all over, so this would mean the drugs cause inflammation, if
    your observation is correct. 
    Toxins don't reach every single spot of your body.

    If all points drop then the first indication is Appendicitis Necroticans
    and Chronic Tonsillitis.

    The drugs that you're talking about, I even don't Neutralize once. It is
    not necessary and can be dangerous if their still needed. 

    Neutralizations of these drugs is unnecessary or even dangerous:

    Insuline: would be very strange to Neutralize, it doesn't suppress and
    neutralizing Insulin (which is a hormone the body needs) is dangerous. 

    Blood Pressure medication: why would you Neutralize that! You could cause
    the Blood Pressure to rise, very dangerous.
   
    Anti-Depressants: If you Neutralize those you can cause the client to go
    into deep depression, why would you want to do that. Treat the cause...
    They will get high on their Anti-Depressant and then they can let go of
    these drugs easily.
   
    Sleeping Pills: As long as clients experience difficulty sleeping, allow
    them to continue. They can't lose even more energy by not sleeping. This
    energy is needed for healing. Neutralization is not needed.

    You first have to treat the causes. You can't Neutralize medication the
    first treatments. 

    Cause of depression: usually Adrenals and sometimes Liver
    Cause of high blood pressure: in this case probably Gallbladder
    compensating for low energy of Adrenals
    Cause diabetes: Gallbladder
    Cause trouble sleeping: Gallbladder/Liver probably...

    What about neutralizing medication that is no longer taken or needed like
    steroids (Prednisone/Prednisolone). Olivia has been on immunosuppressants
    for 3 months. They took her off of it for a little bit so she can rebuild
    her immune system. Should I neutralize her medication (especially the heavy
    ones)?

    When someone has stopped taking drugs you can neutralize them (once). The
    best way to do this is to create a remedy out of the drug with the
    neutralization program, and then to measure with the remedy which organ
    systems are affected. When you then run this remedy along with the normal
    program you also know what support remedies you need to choose to help the
    body heal from the drug.

    For example: The remedy you created from the neutralized medication
    corrects drops on the Kidneys. This means that your treatment with this
    remedy needs to be supported by Kidney support remedies like Solidago or
    Populus.

    More important than neutralizing drugs though is to work on assisting the
    body in recovery from the damage the medication has done. This is done just
    by working in line with your measurement and treatment protocols. The
    neutralization of drugs will help the body get rid of residues and
    sometimes make for a faster recovery, but will not undo the whole effect
    the drug had by itself. Use of immune suppressants for example may have
    lead to infections that the body was not able to get rid of. These
    infections by itself need to be addressed in treatment. 

    Since you have just finished your basic training, I do understand that you
    are probably struggling with the measurements and selection of remedies
    right now, but trying to give a complete treatment using the protocols is
    how you will get the best results… 

    To become better at measuring and to develop a better understanding of the
    protocols quickly, I advise to work on at least 3 people other than your
    daughter. With her there is the pressure to perform as you want to do the
    measurement and treatment quickly and effectively. But to learn and become
    quicker and more efficient (also with your daughter) you need to work with
    people that you feel less pressure with and with whom you have a lot of
    time. When it is OK to make mistakes, and to bruise fingers ;-) you will
    learn much faster which will ultimately benefit Olivia too.

    Thank you Karolina. I haven't treated my daughter yet. Another Biontologist
    is working on her because her situation is just too complicated with the
    swelling and I cannot afford any errors in her case. This Biontologist has
    explained to me that it's better to get in better condition and then worry
    about neutralizing the medication. 

    Questions:
   
    1. So from what I understand once the body is stronger and there are less
    drops it is good to neutralize the medication to completely "reverse" their
    damage, yes? 
   
    2. Or is relying on on basic treatment and body's own detoxification
    enough?
  •

    Answers:

    1. Often neutralization of the medication is not necessary at all. The body
    will usually start to get rid of all kinds of toxins, including drugs, by
    itself because of the improved ability to detoxify after just the normal
    treatment according to the protocols.
    Only when the medication itself is a disturbing factor to the detoxifying
    function of the Kidneys, for example, you may need to use a neutralizing
    remedy of this medication. But even in this case, just stopping the
    medication may cause the disturbance to go away by itself after a couple of
    days.
    Stopping the medication is the first thing that needs to be done before
    neutralization will have any effect at all.

    2. Usually it is, but there is no harm in creating a neutralizing remedy to
    assist the body in getting rid of this specific toxin (only after the
    medication has been stopped and when the body is ready for more
    detoxification).

Chronic Neuropathic Pain

sallydyer
November 2015 edited November 2015 in Symptoms Flag
Client:
42 yrs old woman. She ran a pediatric office.

Symptoms:
Pain => from the Solar Plexus up => particularly ears and mouth
Ears turning purple => sometimes
Mouth twitching => off and on
Head pain => constant and unbearable without medication

History:
2012 => exposure to multiple food poisonings => colitis => symptoms: reflux and
heartburn 
2014 =>  loss of feeling in 3 fingers and her hand => before surgery (cervical
fusion)
2014 => long recovery after surgery (lot of blood loss)
2015 => infected root canal

Medical Interventions:
Yearly flu vaccines
All other vaccines => kept current
Gallbladder removed => 2013
Cervical fusion of C5, C6, and C7 => 2014 => jugular vein was hit during
surgery => almost bled to death => long recovery
Extraction of infected old root canal => fall of 2015 

Medical Diagnoses:
Mononucleosis => 1991 
Colitis => 2012 
Chronic Neuropathic Pain Syndrome => 2015

Medication:
2 anti-depressants => for the pain
Additional medication => for the nerves

Side effects of the medication:
Dizziness
Speech problems
Inability to follow complicated topics

She feels awful on the pain meds. 
She did mention that maybe she should go off of the Prozac but I told her she
needed to work with her doctor.

Questions
1. In the manual you mentioned with nerve pain to look at the Small Intestine
and the Stomach. It is obvious that she had Stomach, Large Intestine,
Gallbladder and bone issues for awhile. 

2. Can you please give me any additional insight on this case?

    1. With Trigeminal Neuralgia the Stomach meridian is at fault since it runs
    over the face. My experience has clearly shown that this is the case.
    Also in this case, it is obvious that the Stomach system is out of balance,
    but more as a result of a malfunctioning Gallbladder system.
    There are clearly Circulation issues too, which are the probable cause of,
    among others, the ear pain.

    2. I would start with a series of Whiplash treatments from the neck down
    along her spine. But do not forget the surgical scars themselves. I think
    this might already bring substantial relief.

    In order to give more case specific advice: I need measurements..

    I did run whiplash on the surgical scars and on her neck but I did not run
    whiplash treatment all the way down her spine. She is coming tomorrow so I
    will do that and then I will post her measurements as well.

    Thank you!

    Current Situation:
    She rescheduled for next week. 
    My client called today and said she was not up for coming because of her
    pain level. 
    I will post her measurements from last week which was session 3.

    3rd Session

    1st Measurement:
    Pineal, Thyroid, Thymus (R), Hypo Insulin => Pertussis
    Thymus (L), Hyper Insulin => Selenium, Calculi Bil
    Heart (L+R) - 3 points each 
    Small Intestine (L+R) - 3 points/all points => Ulcus Ventriculi
    Large Intestine (L+R) - all points/3 points => Appendicitis Necroticans
    Nervous System (L+R) - 3 points/all points
    Veins (L+R) - all points/3 points => Aurumheel, Barijodeel
    Arteries (L+R) - all points/4 points => Aurumheel Barijodeel
    Lymphatic System (L+R) -Tonsil point  => Chronic Tonsillitis, Tonsillitis
    Kidneys (L+R) - Stone point (+ 2 distal points) => Calculi Renales
    Gallbladder (L+R) - Stone point (+ 2 distal points) => Calculi Bil
    Liver (R) - 2 distal points
    Spleen - all points

    >12 yrs Program:
    Calculi Bil, Calculi Renales, Pertussis, Ulcus Ventriculi, Chronic
    Tonsillitis, Tonsillitis

    2nd Measurement:
    No drops

    Footplate Treatment:
    Barijodeel, Aurumheel, Reneel, anginheel, Tonsillar Comp, Gelsenium

    Questions
    1. I know her Gallbladder has been removed but I still add Gallbladder
    nosodes until the body does not ask for it anymore?

    2. Is it too much for me to work on her Intestines while her Kidney's are
    still dropping?

    3. Can stones take multiple sessions to clear?

    4. I was taught in my training that sometimes you need to add the Appendix
    nosodes with the Stomach or Small Intestine at the same time in severe
    cases?

    This client has had so many problems in the past and is in so much pain now
    that I know it is important to stay focused. I appreciate any insight you
    can give.

    1. Yes, but the issue is not likely gallstones alone. I suspect Billiary
    Cirrhosis. 

    2. The Large Intestine shows Appendicitis Necroticans, which means there is
    an issue with the Bacterial Flora in the Intestines, and this causes
    trouble in the Kidneys. 

    You should have treated with Appendicitis Necroticans. The Large Intestine
    comes first after you have corrected the Hormone System and Kidneys, and
    especially in case of Appendicitis. Ulcus Ventriculi is a Stomach nosode,
    and the Stomach is treated later. It is also very unlikely that Ulcus
    Ventriculi corrected drops on both right and left Small Intestine
    meridian. This match is possible for the right side but not for the left. 
    The left normally reacts to Food Poisoning. Food Poisoning might also clean
    some points on the Spleen.

    I cannot imagine that there are no drops anymore after the hand treatment.
    I would have treated with the Intestinal Flora to clear the Kidneys, and
    added additional Kidney support.

    3. Kidney stones have to dissolve or get passed, which is very painful. It
    will take up to 10 treatments with Barijodeel and/or Aurumheel for them to
    be gone. Normally when the arteries and veins do not show up anymore, the
    stone nosodes do not show up anymore.

    4.There is no use to randomly (without finding it in measurement) add
    Appendicitis nosodes with Stomach or Small intestine drops. I have never
    taught this. It is possible that, sometimes, Appendicitis Necroticans or
    Chronic Appendicitis clears Small Intestine points, but never the Stomach.

    Something I am curious about. Is it possible to use 1 glass hand rod and 1
    footplate during a session? Any benefit or drawback? Or, IF it is okay to
    do that which would you put the light in hand rod or footpate??? What
    ramifications are there to how the body processes the light?

    December 2013 edited December 2013 Flag
    There's no difference in the light that comes through a Footplate or a Hand
    Rod. So they are interchangeable.

    What does make a difference is where the light comes into the body -
    through the hands or the feet. 

    If one rod is broken, you could very well use the footplates to put the
    hands on for the >12 yrs treatment.

    Can you remind me of the difference from where the light comes into the
    body? What is the difference if the light comes in the hands vs the feet
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    December 2013 edited December 2013 Flag
    Different meridians run on the feet than on the hands. In the end the light
    reaches all locations of the body, but it does make a difference if you
    only treat with the Hand Rods, only treat with the Footplates, or use
    both. 
    I have learned from experience that doing both is important in order to get
    an optimal effect, for children it never made any difference.

Digestive Disorders Caused By Structural Issues

    Digestive issues could also be a mechanical problem, meaning a bone of the
    spine has moved out of place in a direction the body cannot self correct
    resulting in an irritated, stretched or pinched nerve that blocks the nerve
    supply to the small intestine affecting the digestive process. In addition
    there is a muscle correlation between your Duodenum (1st part of small
    intestine) and the Palmaris Longis Muscle and another correlation
    between  the Ileum (last section of small intestine) and the Anconeus
    Muscle  

    If you know someone who does muscle testing you may want them to muscle
    test these muscles-a weakness of these muscles indicates some level of
    dysfunction in the associated organ.

    Results:
    Symptoms that didn't improve: 
    Tremors, Balance Problems, Shuffling Gait, Softening Voice. 
   
    Symptoms that did improve:
    Stomach problems much better, but they reoccur when she "eats a bad diet"
    Posture has improved. 
    Back/Leg Pain and Tinnitus didn't reoccur
    Feels much better than before beginning treatments. 
   
    Questions:
    I feel I am missing correct treatments for Circulation, which has dropped
    every session. Gallbladder meridian also has at least 1 drop per session
    now, as does the Liver meridian. The thyroid continues to have drops. 
   
    Is there something I can give this Client to impact the Tremors, Balance
    Problems, Shuffling Gait, Softening Voice, Urinary Urgency?

    For the Gait: did you see if her Legs have the same Length?

    Does she take Medication?

    Try also Psorinum and Schwefheel for therapy resistance

    Try to continue with Lymphomyosot for the Circulation several Sessions.

    Try the Intestinal Bacteria, they could be responsible if they have moved
    to the wrong places, which is likely since she had Appendicitis. Also when
    measuring Diverticulosis this is the Support that you should use.

    1)  Leg lengths were the same

    2)  She takes no medications.  Originally took an Anti-Parkinson's
    medication (MAO B inhibitor only) for 1 year though stopped this medication
    2 years ago. Did consume orally a Clay preparation (Calcium Bentonite)
    until beginning Biontology therapy

    3) Will try the other remedies and supports you recommend.

    Thanks;  will report results from the new remedies.
    I think she has "True" Parkinson's.

    Some extra pointers:

    Try to have more Focus. You can do this by deduction of the Underlying
    Cause and then focussing on the Organ System(s) that is in most need of
    Support. Remedies and Support should reflect your insight in the Condition.
    Right now it is somewhat chaotic....

    In your case Circulatory Problems are most likely the Underlying Cause.
    These can be caused by Calcification, Gallbladder or Lympatic problems. So
    the focus should be mainly on the Circulation.

    Fluoride is not a very effective Remedy. It is not part of the Standard set
    of Remedies included in the Chiren. Johan has tested many different
    Homeopathic and other Remedies and has found the ones from Heel and
    Stauphen Pharma to be the most effective, but also these Remedies differ in
    effectiveness. Pellets are not transferred properly into the Chiren or are
    at least not potent enough to work together with this Technology and create
    the Results we are looking for. Dilutes (fluids) seem to work best.
    The Fluoride Remedy that is past around is not even a Homeopathic one. It
    is created from a Fluoride Supplement...

    Many of the Remedies past around are not very potent. The difficulty is
    that when there's some resonance, you sometimes can measure them while they
    won't create the wanted effect in treatment. So this is another reason to
    trust mainly on the Standard Package or try to find a Supplier of
    Homeopathic Remedies that do produce similar effects as the ones of Heel
    and Stauphen Pharma. 

    Johan says that he doesn't see any Indication for "True Parkinson's" in
    your measurements. Because you would have found much more Calcification
    also on the Tissues. You didn't even once measure Osteoheel, Discus or
    Osteoheel....
   
    When you would measure and use Osteoheel, Discus or Calcoheel it also needs
    Focus. None of these Remedies will solve the problems in just one time.
    Bone problems and Calcification are very "material" and need many
    treatments to be changed.

    Thank you both for the guidance, 

    Question:
    Are Psorinum and Schwefheel used in a 2-7 Standard Program before
    administering any other remedies? 
    Or is it to be used in the 12 Year Standard Program with other remedies
    that are measured? 
    Are measurements done before giving Psorinum and Schwefheel?

    I have a client very similar to this lady, of who I am sure she doesn't
    have Parkinson's.

    Things I've worked on:
    I have supported her Circulation each session.

    Psorinum and Schwefheel worked very nicely for her and she had very few
    drops the next time. 

    Symptoms now:
    Still Tremors in hand, Balance Problems 
   
    Questions:
    I was thinking of trying Lymphomyosot, treating her with Intestinal Flora
    (when Intestines are all clear as expected).
    She will possibly need some more Nosodes on the Liver...
    I am running out of ideas and she says that she will only come probably
    twice more - having come about 9 times up until now.
   
    I'm frustrated with her Tremors not being affected. What should I do?

    Today our local newspaper ran an article that talked about  Parkinson's
    appearing in patients affected by Pesticides. Goes to show that the medical
    community is all over the map in terms of this "disease", but I will also
    check my client for this..... 

    Question:
    Any other suggestions besides Pesticides? 

    My client has listened to every one of Johan's presentations or shows on
    Parkinson's and read all of the biontology website, Just a little pressure
    to find the answer to those tremors!

    Madelyn:
    Treat with Schwefheel and Psorinum on the long program. You can always try
    to match them on the Skin Meridian.

    Jennifer:
    There might be a connection with Pesticides. Two of my Parkinson's patients
    also have been in touch with a lot of Pesticides. Pesticides are generally
    nerve killers, but so is chemo. They are very toxic.

    Parkinson is a Muscle problem. There can be many problems with the Muscles,
    including the Circulation, the Liver, the Gallbladder, the Nerves. Perhaps
    treating the Small Bloodvessels (Placenta) and the Lymphatic Vessels 
    (Lymphomyosot) is the solution improving the exchange between the
    Bloodvessels and the Muscles.

    Update:
    Arthritis and Dermatitis on her hands makes measuring very Challenging.
    But theTreatment went very well.

    Measurement:
    Gallbladder - no drops
    Small Intestines - one Food Poisoning
    Circulation - Placenta 
    Lymphatic System - Lymphomyosot 
    Nervous System - Dioxin, Pesticides ==> also corrected the Liver!!! (hope
    this gives a break through)

    I have one more treatment with her next week before she goes away for a few
    weeks, so I have my fingers crossed that this will be the answer to her
    tremors..

    when under stress but when she is relaxed they go away after a treatment.

    Insecticides and Dioxin matched on my client's Nervous System.

    Results:
    Tremors lessened for the first time!
    The next session I didn't measure Dioxin, but I did find Insecticides again
    and once more she found that her tremors were reduced. 
   
    I also gave her Placenta and Lymphomyosot each time so I suggest adding
    those as well if they work for your client. Good luck  :)

    My patient, I swear, has listened to every word that Johan has ever uttered
    about Parkinson's and has listened to every online show that discusses it
    in conjunction with biophoton therapy. Although I was able to point out all
    of the progress she has made so far: (no more disturbances from
    vaccinations, food poisonings, heavy metals, things like insecticides etc.,
    much improved functioning of all organs and circulation system and a normal
    blood test), she pushes me for more. (I don't mind!) She says that Johan
    has suggested that he has had 97% success rate with Parkinson's patients.
    Does this mean that their tremors were eliminated, or that they became
    healthy but with tremors remaining? She said that the myline sheath
    (spelling?) could still be the issue, as heard in the latest broadcast. Is
    this something that will repair itself over time, or can we encourage it to
    heal with support remedies on the nervous system? I know there are several
    practitioners like me who are at the same stage as I am with my patient and
    just need a little more clarity on the tremors. Thank you.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    That is a pretty high percentage!!! I wished Johan would not throw around
    numbers like that. And I think this number was meant as an overall success
    rate, not specifically for Parkinson's...(?)

    Parkinson's has always been one of the hardest conditions to treat, that is
    if it is "true Parkinson's". Johan found that many of the Clients diagnosed
    with Parkinson's whom he treated in Walnut Creek were actually
    misdiagnosed, and then it changes the prospects.

    What you can explain to your Client is that the success of Biontology lies
    in the treatment of the Functional Disturbances, however if there's
    Structural Damage (e.g. permanent nerve damage). This is not something the
    Chiren can do anything about... 

    Everything that can still be repaired when function improves will improve,
    but not everything can be repaired... So there's no way of predicting to
    what extend a Client can improve. Myelin Sheaths often can be repaired by
    the body if Schwann Cells are still intact.. 

    Then there's also the matter of patience. When the Functional Disturbance
    is gone, the body still needs time to repair the damage that was caused by
    the disease. 
    If there's still improvement noticeable this is a good sign, or isn't this
    the case in your Client's situation?

    Yes Karolina, I listed all of the improvements in her condition and pointed
    them out to her. She even says that she feels extremely well. She is very
    focussed on the tremors themselves and her lessened coordination and
    ability to balance. Her intestines were the last organ to clear and her
    nervous system is all that still drops. As long as I find a drop there, I
    am hopeful that we are making progress because I have been able to balance
    it with each session. eg. dioxin, insecticides etc. Placenta and
    Lymphomyosot still apply - should I give her Nervous System support
    remedies and perhaps cerebrum when I can? I just wanted to make sure that I
    wasn't missing anything....yes, that 97% sure puts the pressure on us....I
    am actually really pleased with how her entire treatment has gone.  :)

Physical Attack Situation

Barbaralee
October 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
19 year old boy, who has been severely beaten by a gang 6 days before
treatment. The attack was focussed on kicking his eyes and trying to choke him.

Symtpoms:
Crushed eye socket
Both eyes swollen
Multiple contusions,heavily bruised
Choking bruises 
Nose and jaw broken
Dehydration (skin not elastic)
To weak to sit = put a sleeping down with pillows so he could lie down on the
floor during treatment

Medical interventions:
Plastic stents in his nose to keep the airway open. 
Titanium steel plates in face around eyes. 

Medication:
Vicodin (for pain)
I.V. with antibiotics - but mother stopped this treatment although prescribed
Arnica - mother has been using this on him

Measurement:
Measured and treated both Spin Inversion and Whiplash

Nervous System - multiple drops
Large Intestine - drops

No other drops on meridians, but measurements sounded really low

No Hand Treatment

Questions:
1. I considered Fibroma Pendulum, but didn't know where to measure that
against?
2. Tried to be gentle with treatment, but what should I have known or done in
the nosode department?

Footplate Treatment:
Berberis, Belladonna, Arnica, Atropinum, Selenium, Placenta, Tonico

Short Hand Program (2-7 yrs)
Emergency Essence, Flannel Flower, Confidence essence, Olive, Sunshine Wattle

Comments/Questions:
3. I made the choice to not treat the scars on his face. Many of them are
internal going up through his mouth so I can't really see them. On monday when
he comes back I will treat the two visible scars.
4. Would a scar treatment over his eyes be helpful? Maybe with using Oculoheel
(it doesn't say it is helpful for eye trauma)

Results:
After the Whiplash and Spin Inversion treatment the boy fell into a deep
sleep. 
He hadn't been able to sleep, but now slept for an hour and a half on my floor!

    Hi Barbara,

    In a situation like this you should just follow the protocol too (as much
    as possible). 
    So after Whiplash, Spin Inversion just start with the Triple Warmer and
    take care that at least this system is working again. This means that you
    have to use nosodes, and give a regular hand treatment followed by a
    footplate treatment. 
   
    In your measurement there weren't a lot of drops showing, but than again he
    had lots of wounds/scars and was taking a painkiller. So your readings were
    unreliable.
   
    Dry skin creates another measurement problem because you need "water" to
    get conduction. 
    Because of a lack of water in and under the skin the electrical current of
    the measurement probe and hand electrode meets a lot of resistance => low
    sound. 

    I understand that you chose not to use the first hand-treatment because
    your client fell asleep and couldn't hold the rods anymore, but you can get
    around that by strapping the rods on his arms or using the footplates with
    the >12 year program. 
    If you only have time left for one treatment, which is not unusual when you
    need to treat a lot of scars, the hand program is the program to use, not
    the dyslexia program. The >12 year program is especially designed to open
    up the body slowly to the treatment, it doesn't give all frequencies at
    once like the footplates do.

    Your Questions
    1. I'm interested in understanding why you think of Fibroma Pendulum? This
    remedy is made from skin-tags (fibrous skin-tumors).
   
    2. At least the Anti-Tetanus nosode should have been given, because your
    client probably received this vaccination in the hospital after the
    beating. And then Poliomyelitis is one to never skip, because of the
    Pituitary gland's important role in self-regulation/self-healing. 
   
    To find the other nosodes that are needed the best way is measurement
    (asking the body!). If you would have treated the scars, the measurement
    would probably have been more reliable. It is impossible that the Arteries
    and Veins didn't show any drop for example. 
    By measuring -when possible- you reduce the "danger" of overlooking a
    possible infection. The main reason for the hospital to prescribe 
    antibiotics = wounds do get infected sometimes and it is good to pay
    attention to this risk in Biontology too. Staph. Aureus is almost always a
    problem in hospitals, but other bacteria are common too...
    Endorphins are also a likely factor to block the measurement in a situation
    like this. He used a painkiller, but the extreme damage (=stress) to the
    body alone will create endorphins too. So Plumbum, Viscum, Atropinum would
    have been very helpful to put into the slots during your measurement.
   
    3. Scars in a situation like this is something I would not postpone, the
    wounds are the major issue. Getting the energy balanced locally to support
    healthy healing of the tissue makes sense...
   
    4. Oculoheel is indeed not a trauma remedy for the eyes. Just the scar
    treatment itself is sufficient for any external or energetic scar. 
    The internal scars can be treated with Procrainum in a slot.

    Thank you for your most helpful comments.
    I am away from my records, but wanted to answer your questions.

    1. I thought of Fibroma Pendulum due to what is printed in old manual:
    "Cleaning of the tissue; stimulation of immune system." Thinking of all the
    infection issues as well as the health of his tissues, the idea arrived.
    However, I chose otherwise as you can see.

    Client returned for a second treatment and was much improved. His mother
    shared that they had also been using a microcurrent mat (PEMF). I asked
    them to wait 72 hours between treatments if possible. They insisted these
    two modalities were compatible.

    I'll write more later about this in a better format. But on his third visit
    I was concerned because his nervous system (although not dropping) was
    barely reading (low garbled). He just seemed suppressed, moody and still
    too ready to drop off to sleep. I told him something seemed off and he
    admitted to smoking a lot of pot.

    A whole new element in treatment appeared.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    October 2013 edited October 2013 Flag
    Ah... now I understand! You are right about Fibroma Pendulum being
    described in this way in the manual... I forgot, since when I was searching
    for more understanding about the different remedies I found out it is
    actually made from skin-tags (which might very well be caused by toxins in
    the tissue...). This is one of those nosodes that doesn't match very
    often... I asked Johan and he also finds this to be the case. He hardly
    ever needs this one.

    The micro-current mat for sure interferes with the biophoton treatment,
    even if you plan this in between sessions. So your client has to choose one
    of the two modalities since they are not compatible at all. One (the
    micro-current therapy) is directed toward suppression - as is the pot...
    and the other (Biontology) is focussed on lifting suppression and restoring
    the self healing ability of the body. 

    It seems like your client is not really invested in Biontology... or he
    just does not properly understand how both modalities are conflicting.
    Sometimes explaining it helps.

    Hi Peter,

    I used as much shorthand as possible due to having too many characters in
    my posting. All footplate treatments were with the remedies listed for each
    treatment. I couldn't list any more than 3 treatment because of the
    character limit.

    On the 1st treatment, there were 2 drops on the Spleen meridians on the
    left foot. There have never been any drops on the gallbladder. On treatment
    5, there was 1 drop on the liver meridian on the left foot.

    On the 2nd treatment I did an internal scar treatment for his
    tonsillectomy. However, no new drops were found after treatment.

    I hope this helps.

    Hi Jiri
    Have you used anti-tetanus and poliomyeitis. It is important to get the
    hormonal system in order in the beginning.And what about selenium and maybe
    Berbeis for the adrenal glands, and Atropinum. I think the body is in a lot
    of stress.

    In your 1. sessions you test for appendicitis + chronic appendicitis. did
    you test for this in your next treatment?
    and what about support for this on the footplates? 

    How is kidney,bladder and circulation function?

    I think you have to focus on the main issue and remember to support them on
    the footplates :)

    A lot of questions :) but an interesting case, that will be exciting to
    follow.

    Hi Jiri,
   
    Margit made some very good observations about your case. Without the
    Pituitary functioning right it is not likely your client will self-heal
    completely. Poliomyelitis is always necessary when people have been
    vaccinated, as is Anti-Tetanus.

    What I would like to add is that most symptoms are pointing toward Adrenal
    (cortex) insufficiency. The dehydration is due to inability of the body to
    retain salt and water (low Aldosteron). The bronzing is a sign that the
    situation is already quite severe and the Pituitary is working overtime. A
    lack of Cortisol causes hypoglycaemia (shaking, constant hunger, dizziness)
    and low blood pressure too. Cortisol is also important in dealing with
    inflammation and a lack of this hormone makes it almost impossible to get
    rid of inflammation..

    So focus on the Hormone System. Sometimes, just by restoring the function
    of the Pituitary with Poliomyelitis and then supporting with Selenium the
    Adrenals get balanced by themselves. But since the condition is this severe
    it might need more focus than this.

    In the mean time it might be helpful to let him drink his water with a
    pinch of unrefined sea-salt, because a lot of sodium is flushed out with
    adrenal cortex insufficiency.

    The fact that this man is an electrician also makes me wonder if the
    electro-magnetic fields he is exposed to on a daily basis are causative of
    or aggravating his condition.

    I would advise you strongly to run a Spin-Inversion treatment with blood
    anyway (to strengthen his aura and the positive spin of his electrons) and
    then to give support with Ozaliet, Selenium, Berberis, Tonico, Aletris.
    See how he reacts on this.

    I'm looking forward to hear of the progress you make with this case. 

    The issue with your posts appearing to large for the forum because of "too
    many characters" might be due to copying and pasting text from another
    program like Word. To prevent issues with text format it is best to use the
    window that opens when you choose the button with the picture of a

    Hi Karolina & Margit,

    I really appreciate your comments and questions. 

    My greatest weakness is looking at symptoms and understanding the cause. 
    I can find drops and treat them but I don't understand the next step of
    finding the cause and treating that. If there are no drops on the meridians
    that I believe are the cause, how can I test and treat?

    1.  In the 2nd Session I tried Polio and Anti-Tetanus on the Pituitary but
    it continued to drop with each so I didn't use them.

    2. I have never had a drop on the Adrenals in any session. 
    Do I just treat without measuring because of his symptoms?

    3. No, I didn't recheck Appendicitis & Chronic Appendicitis in the 2nd
    session. 
    I think I have mistakenly thought that I only use Cerebrum, Ciscum and
    Thalamus as remedies in the 1th session.

    4. There have not been any drops on the Kidney and Bladder meridians. If
    there are no drops after putting in all the nosodes, do I still need to
    support them? 
    There was a drop on Circulation (L 1) in session 5. It was corrected with
    Cholesterium. 

    I have a confusion as to how many remedies can be used with the Foot
    Treatment. I thought I remembered reading that too many remedies may not
    produce the best results so keep them to a minimum. 
    I try to always support the Gallbladder with Atropinum if there are not too
    many others used. Please clarify this for me.
    I did used Ozaliet in his 4th & 5th sessions but not for the right reason.
    I wanted to strengthen his Aura because of his emotional sensitivity. After
    those treatments, he felt a great peace of mind & emotional resiliency.
    Then I read that Ozaliet should not be used because it can mask symptoms.

    5. Karolina, thanks so much for your recommendation do give a
    spin-inversion treatment and the supports. He comes on Wednesday afternoon
    so will try this. From what I've read, after using the spin inversion
    treatment, I unplug the cup during measurement, then plug it in for both
    the hand and foot treatments.

    Thank you both so much for your help. I will keep you posted with the
    results.

    About 5. I would recommend you to read the part of spin  and more.
    But first meassure for spin do the treatment and unplug the cup and
    continue after protocol. The cup shall stay unpluged.

    Jiri,
    After treating spin, it is perfectly acceptable to remove the blood from
    the spiral/cup while measuring, and then put it back in the spiral/cup for
    the rod and footplate treatments.  As long as you have the blood you may as
    well put it to maximum use.  However, new blood must be obtained for
    subsequent treatment sessions.

    Thanks you. It's been a busy day so I didn't get a chance to answer.

    Peter, you can find the information in this discussion

    I did give the spin inversion treatment to my client. The treatment
    corrected the drops in adrenals and thyroid from my 1st measurement. The
    pituitary continued to drop but was corrected with Polio & Anti-Tetanus
    which showed up today! I'm excited to see how his week goes!

    He also asked me to thank you for your interest in his problems and your
    help in correcting them.

    Hi Karolina,

    Should I give the Spin-Inversion treatment with each visit even if he
    doesn't have the drops?

    He asked me to thank you for your help with his medical problems. He's had
    these problems so long that he's thought he would never be well again. Now
    he has more hope.

    Hi Jiri,

    Going back to your post of October 8th...

    I understand the struggle. When you just start learning Biontology there is
    so much knowledge to gather, that then has to be integrated and used to
    become "knowing", only after which it can evolve in a kind of natural flow/
    intuition. But in the beginning it is very normal that you just don't know
    enough yet to experience that kind of flow. First the foundation has to be
    in place, that's why the forum is there ;-).

    I will comments on your points (of the 8th) one by one:

    1. Anti-Tetanus is measured on the Parathyroid and Poliomyelitis on the
    Pituitary.
    It might be that there was a slight correction but not completely when you
    tested for Polio on the Pituitary, so that it was not easy to hear for the
    untrained ear. Sometimes a combination is needed like Polio + Variolinum to
    correct the Pituitary.
    But you can remember that when someone has been vaccinated for Polio, which
    almost everyone is, that you have to use this remedy the first time. (But
    always measure to see how where these remedies correct things... putting
    remedies in without measurement can make you lose valuable information.

    2. In this case because it is so clear he has Adrenal problems I would
    consider it a measurement problem that I don't measure it and Support them
    anyway.

    3. Viscum, Thalamus and Cerebrum are Supports like any other support remedy
    and they can be used when you have indications for them. (see remedy list
    that was sent around)
    It has been a long time misconception that, since this combination is
    always used in the very specific treatment of Dyslexia, that it always
    should be part of the Footplate Treatment. And this is not true. So maybe
    that was the confusion.

    4. If there are no drops on the Kidney and Bladder you don't need to use
    Nosodes for them, but it might be a good idea to use some support in order
    to assist the detoxification that treatment initiates.

    The number of remedies you need depends on what you measure. It is always
    the challenge to balance everything with as little Nosodes as possible,
    because when one remedy corrects many meridians it means that it's
    information is causative, or is very close to a causative factor of the
    disease.
    You can also "under-dose" on remedies. The Organ Systems that needed
    Nosodes also need the right Supports to assist in healing. So when there's
    Cholecystitis, for example, it makes sense to use Chelidonium or Injeel
    Chol.

    In the measurement Ozaliet is not the first one to try, because it can
    indeed have an effect of temporarily balancing the light (ones energy and
    aura become stronger) without addressing the deeper issues that need
    Nosodes in order to heal. But you can use it without problems after you
    have measured what was needed to treat the underlying cause. I even
    strongly advise you to use Ozaliet for this man, because his energy level
    and protection need to be raised.

    5. The decision to treat again with Spin-Inversion depends completely on
    how he felt after the treatment, what you measure and how he is feeling
    next session.
    You always need to look at all factors and observe what results your
    decisions in treatment had. If he felt a bit better after treatment, but
    then during the week becomes completely exhausted again, he was probably
    out of Spin Inversion temporarily but couldn't maintain it due to lack of
    energy and unhealthy exposure to EMF. In that case you'll have to talk
    about this with him and try to find solutions to limit this as much as
    possible during recovery.

    When there's hope there's less stress ;-) Very good!

    Karolina, thank you for clarifying all my questions. I've found it very
    helpful. When I first started seeing him in August, he stated that he had
    burns on his chest. At that time, I wasn't sure if and how to use the scar
    treatment on them. I know how with a surgical scar. But, with a burn, do
    you need to treat all edges of the burn? Do I concentrate on those that may
    cross a meridian?

    He has just send me an email detailing his injuries. They are 2nd & 3rd
    degree burns on his chest, rib cage, back, legs and arms up to the side of
    his neck. It happened when he was 16 from an industrial accident where he
    was sprayed with 400 degree grease. He spent 2 1/2 months in hospital
    receiving burn care. This is the same time that his other symptoms began.
    So, I'm suspecting that this may be the source of his symptoms and it's
    important to treat the scars correctly. I'd really appreciate your input. 
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    October 2013 edited October 2013 Flag
    The burn accident and the resulting scars are definitely causal! 
   
    The trauma itself can exhaust adrenals and cause a downward spiral in
    health, but also the scars have been continuous blocking his light
    communication pathways... Without treating the scars there will most likely
    not be much improvement and on top of that your measurements are completely
    unreliable with al the scars crossing the meridians.
    When scars cross meridians you'll get inaccurate measurements (no drops
    while an organ is not healthy or energetic drops, that won't be corrected
    by remedies). 
   
    Scar treatment on large patches of damaged skin can be very difficult,
    since you can only treat 7 cm at the time in between the rods and one of
    the rods should touch healthy skin.
    It will probably need a lot of patience and creativity to do this..
   
    If the scars are not that big but it is a lot of work to treat them all,
    you can choose to spend a whole session (or more) on just doing this. You
    could also advise him to use a Chikey at home and do some of the scar
    treatments himself or with some assistance of a friend/partner...

I was told to look up the Dutch book "In Naam van de Aap" and cannot find it
through any of my searches.

I was told it has 20 infections that can lead to a positive HIV test..

If anyone has that book could you please tell me what those 20 infections are
so that I can check those nosodes on my HIV client?

Thank you kindly.

    "Extract in Dutch"

    Johan van Dongen is the Dutch writer, so you might want to google him. This
    is one page you can start with, there seems to be a new book from him (

    s to share from a discussion I had with Johan about the book's content and
    what to look for when treating someone with HIV:

    Be mindful when treating someone with HIV positive status:

    If they are on the really strong AIDs medicines, be careful and ask Johan
    what to do because he told me treat them before they go on the big anti
    viral medicine that they have to apparently stay on the rest of their life.

    If they are not on the BIG meds yet, then it is safe to work on them for
    sure.

    Ionizer

    Home and office must have good fresh air. I got Honeywell big one like
    Johan and Lillian have in their CA office. The old forum says make sure it
    takes out mold, dust, smoke, and fills the room with at least 500 parts per
    cm3,

    Proper ratio: 70%negative ions, 30% positive

    Sensitive to Flares. Solar flares are 100% positive ions thus upsetting the
    70 30 ratio

    Spin inversion very often in HIV clients

    whiplash, remove all vaccines.

    Chronic fatique and too many endorphins found in all HIV clients.

    Treat with myaligc encephalitis (chronic fatigue) and find what the virus/
    infection is.
    Possible Nosodes to look for (pay close attention to lungs/large intestine
    connection) are:

    periproptic abcess (especially for homosexual men.)
    TB
    TB Bovine
    Malaria
    Trichomonas?
    Streps
    Staphs

    (apparently there are 20 total nosodes to look for. Get rest of list from
    Johan if possible

    I'm looking forward to hearing comments.
    Please also consider the new information from a session on Friday Nov. 28
    below.

    New information
    Client arrived for a session feeling much better.
    Said he resolved the headaches using Gotu Kola and Ginko Biloba.
    He also said he smoked marijuana 2 days before the session and had some
    wine the day before.
    His energy was up.
    Reported only slight nausea.

    1st Measurement
    I measured no drops.

    Ran 2 Min Endorphin removing protocol

    2nd Measurement
    Still no drops.
    3rd Measurement 
    Tested with Endorphin remedies in the slots
    Still no drops.

    Footplate Treatment
    Pure light only

    Comments
    I was glad that he is feeling better and would love to believe that we have
    eliminated the issues but wonder if the herbs may still be masking
    symptoms.
    As he is in the healing business as an herbal remedy manufacturer, he is
    quite knowledgeable in this area. In researching the herb GotuKola, it
    seems that it is primarily an anti-inflammatory, which also decreases blood
    pressure. I'm not clear on how to instruct him since I don’t know what
    effect this may be having on measurement or if is truly useful as a
    palliative.
    I understand that Johan has generally advised against supplements and herbs
    but when a client's pain disappears by taking a supplement, it is difficult
    to argue against it.

    He is coming back this week for a check in.

    Questions:
     1. I'm still curious about the cause of the headaches. Perhaps Lyme
        die-off? I treated with Whiplash in Session 5 which client believes
        made the headaches worse.
     2. He is buying a Chikey and is leaving for an upcoming extended trip to
        Thailand. (Dec. 15th) Could you provide clarification on instructing
        use of the Chikey while traveling

        This is what I've come up with
        • Treat water placing fiber optic cable into the water Run Program 2
        • Treat foods placing foods in bowl of water. Place fiber optic cable
        into the water Run Program 2


        I am planning to program the following cards with the following
        remedies:


        Travel Card -
        Instructions:

            Use on Program 2 after flight, 1x

            Do not run on the same day as other card(s)

            Could be used daily if feeling imbalanced / dizzy while staying in
            hotels to offset EMF or too much sun exposure.

            Do not use if feeling well.

        Remedies on card:

            1. Causticum

            2. Electro essence

            3. Space clearing essence

            4. Ozaliet

            5. Viscum

            6. Crab apple

            7. Insecticides

            8. Solaris Essence


        Headache/Circulation/Energy Card:
        Instructions:

            Use on Program 2 - 1x a day maximum

            Do not run on the same day as other card(s)

            Do not use if feeling well.


        Remedies on card:

            1. Circulo

            2. Aesculus

            3. Selenium

            4. Berberis

            5. Melilotus

            6. Testis

            7. Calm & Clear

            8. Meditation essence


    Does this seem sufficient? or would you suggest other cards / remedies?

    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    December 2014 edited December 2014 Flag
    There are many things to say about this case:

    1. Your client has a habit of suppressing everything. For him to feel "up"
    is not the reality of his situation.

    2. Marijuana creates endorphins and masks the real issues. So your
    measurements are not reliable and the way he feels after using marijuana is
    not something you can base your assessment on. Other herbs and medication
    can suppress too

    3. Marijuana weakens the aura and can even create holes in it

    4. There were most likely already boundary issues and dissociative patterns
    because of past abuse that are even aggravated by the use of drugs. The
    combination of abuse and drugs is a cause for possession, or for suppressed
    parts of the person himself to start lead an own life (this mimics
    possession but is actually a splitting off of ones negative feelings that
    are not recognised as ones own anymore)

    5. In the energetic reality like attracts like. So negative attachment can
    only happen to unconscious or suppressed negative parts of a person. A
    fully conscious person will not be possessed, so what needs to happen is
    that your client needs to stop running away from his feelings by using
    suppressive methods (he probably has more ways of suppression than one)

    6. You cannot suppress what feels uncomfortable and expect those parts to
    heal. So in order to become free of negative attachments he needs to allow
    his darker feelings to surface and face them, and at the same time put up
    boundaries for energies that are not his. But first he needs to know what
    are HIS feelings. If you do not know where you begin or end there is no way
    of putting up healthy boundaries.

    7. The remedy "Arcons" that you used is not a Biontology remedy and is
    created from a piece of paper with the word Archons written on it. It will
    not do anything and also does not address the cause anyway. The cause is
    dissociation of negative feelings and weakening of the aura. Arcons is one
    of those failed experiments that was not helpful at all beyond influencing
    the psyche of people by suggestion. It also stimulates people to look for
    the source of the problems outside of themselves and adopt a victim
    mentality, while they really have to look inside (without judgment)

    8. The client has responsibility for his own choices, so the only thing you
    can do is explain the above to him. Biontology will not work beyond symptom
    improvement as long as he keeps suppressing with all kind of drugs. But
    this case description suggests that he is really invested in "feeling
    good", so he may stop the treatment if he realises he needs to start
    feeling how he really feels… which is not well

    9. Headaches and nausea are primarily caused by the Gallbladder meridian.
    Headaches on the sides and on top of the head are caused by the Gallbladder
    and Bladder meridians. The reason why they don't show up is due to
    suppression of marijuana, herbs and possible other things he does to escape
    his feelings

    10. An effective Chiren treatment lifts suppression, so his headaches
    suggest there were Gallbladder and Bladder issues even though you did not
    measure it. Anger and fear are definitely emotions that he should own up to
    with his past experience of abuse. These emotions will likely come up when
    the treatments lift the suppression and he does not self-medicate against
    them. This was probably happening after the 4th session, but it was too
    much because the Liver was treated too soon

    11. Zirrhose Hepatis lifts suppression when it is there and the severe
    Gallbladder response may have arised because you treated the Liver too
    soon. The Liver is possibly still suppressing, which is an underlying cause
    for Gallbladder meridian problems. One treatment with Liver Cirrhosis
    cannot solve everything. Often the various forms of Hepatitis show up in
    the course of healing, and perhaps there are even deeper lying issues that
    need to be addressed. But first you need several treatments where you can
    make the right assessment (without in between use of marijuana or other
    causes for endorphin production)

    12. Until the suppression is lifted there is no way of knowing what exactly
    causes all of his symptoms, only that the Gallbladder meridian is affected.
    What is behind this needs to be discovered when the body is ready after
    several proper treatments without in between use of suppressive methods

    13. Based on the symptoms, you can put Gallbladder nosodes and supports in
    to work on the Gallbladder and try to lift suppression this way, even if
    you don't measure it.
    Use: Cholecystitis, Billiary Cirrhosis, Calculi Bil, Chelidonium,
    Atropinum, Injeel Chol and Berberis

    14. When you find Cystophyelonephritis on the Bladder, also look for the
    Bacteria that cause the infection.

    15. Putting a remedy in twice (Duodenoheel in treatment 5) does not do
    anything different than putting it in just once

    16. When there are endorphins, using Viscum, Plumbum and Atropinum is no
    guarantee for lifting it especially when the situation is severe

    17. You use very few nosodes and a lot of supports. Nosodes are the
    remedies needed to solve causes, and the supports should reflect what you
    are working on with the nosodes. So if you treat with Zirrhose Hepatis, you
    need to put a lot of support in for the Liver. You only used Chelidonium.
    Treating the Liver while you probably have not worked on the real
    underlying causes yet -because of all the suppression and endorphins- was,
    as I can see it now, the cause for the headaches. Sufficient support
    possibly would have limited these symptoms, but there is no certainty in
    that. 

    18. You do not have to become a psychologist to help this man, but just
    need to explain the phenomenon of suppression and that no true physical or
    emotional healing can happen while he actively uses suppressing substances
    and methods. He then can choose to give Biontology a chance without using
    marijuana. The treatments on the one hand by lifting suppression can bring
    up emotional and physical discomfort (that was already there, but just not
    consciously experienced), but on the other hand they will also help him get
    through these feelings easier and help resolve them.
    Treatment is the same as always: use nosodes and support remedies and work
    according to the protocols in your new manual.

    Johan:
     Thank you for that lengthy and thorough explanation. And also thanks for
    the insight that I hadn't thought previously to look at which bacteria
    causes the infection when you find cystopyelonephritis

    Thank you Johan for all of the insight. Yes, I understand that suppression
    through the use of marijuana could be masking.
    He has since returned for another session since my last posting and showed
    no drops.
    He said he has not had any drugs or supplements since prior to the previous
    treatment so I ran the endorphin protocol and still no drops.
    He reports feeling more energy and appeared better and more clear than
    before.

    Do you feel that biontology may have worked in spite of the marijuana?

    There are many claims these days about the healing qualities of marijuana
    for everything from cancer to many other conditions. I don't know enough
    about this but it is claimed that cannabidiol in marijuana which is not
    psychoactive has the ability to cause death of cancer cells. Do you feel
    there is any merit to this?

    My client is leaving for Thailand next week
    and taking a Chikey.
    Could you please respond to question 2 above regarding Chikey usage

    Many thanks

    * Even the healthiest person will have some drops, since life is not static
    and the body is always in the middle of finding balance. If no drop or
    variation in measurement is found this should always be considered
    suspicious. It shows suppression.

    * The thing with Biontology is that you really need to look at everything:
    your client's symptoms, his measurements, previous treatments and the
    responses to them, his history… all needs to be integrated into your
    assessment. Then you will also wonder and be able to see that some
    responses make no sense.
    When your measurements haven't allowed you to make a reliable assessment in
    any of the sessions due to Endorphin Mask, and even after a week of
    stopping Marijuana there is still a mask, it is unlikely the client is
    making progression. Progression is shown by a relief of tension, and this
    is shown by a drop in endorphins. This has not happened yet, so there is
    not much progression.

    * Counterintuitively, when a client who has had a lot of endorphins starts
    to make progression, he or she will start to feel worse for a while. Common
    are exhaustion, depression, suppressed feelings (can be anything) coming
    up, reappearance of old aches and pains that were thought to be gone etc.

    * When there is severe suppression, which can have many causes apart from
    the marijuana too, using Viscum, Atropinum and Plumbum will not always
    work.
    Sometimes Spin Inversion treatment will work to lift an endorphin mask when
    spin inversion is the cause, and sometimes you will have to resort to
    treating with Gallbladder nosodes and supports to lift the tension. But
    even this can fail.
    If none of these methods cause drops to appear it does not mean that there
    were no endorphins, just that the attempts to get them down didn't work.

    * Treating the Liver lifts deep suppression, however, when done before the
    Yang organs are cleared, what needs to be released cannot be expressed or
    expelled and only causes extra tension. The fact that your client responded
    to the Liver treatment with headaches and then self-medicated immediately
    after shows that there is deep and old suppression (Liver level) + a
    pattern/habit of actively trying to get rid of uncomfortable feelings the
    moment they come up.

    * For more information about endorphins read the new manual, there you will
    also find that this feeling of "having more energy and feeling better" does
    not necessarily mean that your client is getting better, it can just as
    well mean that increased stress on the body raises the endorphin levels
    even more. And since you were not able to lift the suppression (your
    measurement did not change) this is a possibility...

    * When I had just been trained and was treating people without much
    understanding of Biontology, I have encountered two clients who had very
    few drops and who seemed to be very easy to treat since they were always
    raving about how they had felt during the week. Both were later on
    diagnosed with severe cancer… one of them died... Of course I am not
    suggesting here that that is what is going on with your client, but it is
    good to realise that serious illness can cause high endorphins too.

    * When there are still endorphins created while no Marijuana was used
    during the week in between treatments, you need to ask your client
    questions about other possible actions he has taken that may cause
    endorphin levels to rise. For example:
    Did you exercise? Did you use other herbs or medication? Did you use
    magnets? Did you use acupuncture? Did you use any other form of energy
    therapy?


    Some reflection on the health-claims made for marijuana:
    1. In no research on marijuana the energetic functioning of the body is
    taken into account. In Biontology-measurement it becomes very clear that
    Marijuana causes endorphin masking and possible aura damage. Endorphin mask
    is a positive sign of severe stress to the body… So what do you trust?
    Claims that are made based on research you were not participating in and
    are often based on petri-dish research which is not a real-life situation,
    or your own observation in measurement and treatment? 
    Severe stress (shown by the extreme endorphin release) is never beneficial
    and can never be the cause of any self-healing.

    2. It is probably the THC that causes the endorphin mask. If there is
    benefit to other parts of the marijuana (e.g. the cannabinoids) and he
    wants to try that, he needs to use the extract and not smoke marijuana. But
    it may very well be that the cannabinoids are also very suppressive.

    3. There are good reasons not to immediately accept all kind of medical
    claims. Many claims have been made in the past about many substances that
    later turned out to be not all the miracle that was promised. Some even
    caused illnesses that were more severe than the symptoms they suppressed.
    Think for example about Mercury (used for syphilis and typhoid fever, or
    parasites), Radium & X-rays (used for among others skin affections and
    rejuvenation of the mind), but also think about Penicillin which delivers
    the promise to get rid of pathological bacteria but ruins your gut flora at
    the same time, causing chronic illness in the long run.

    4. The "positive" effects of marijuana can very well be caused by the
    extreme rise in endorphin levels, which in Biontology is known to be not
    such a good thing but a sign of suppression. The underlying problem will
    not be solved this way.
    High endorphins causes among others: muscle relaxation, euphoria, pain
    relief and reduction of fear/anxiety… just like morphine. 

    5. I have met several people who used/use marijuana and suffer serious -not
    so healthy- consequences because of it, especially on the level of
    emotional/mental/spiritual functioning. When one does not deal with certain
    issues and uses substances to relax and feel good, nothing is transformed
    or overcome. The energy of the memories/feelings that needs to be
    acknowledged grows stronger and stronger and at one point they will no
    longer be ignored.  

    6. Many long term marijuana users experience a decline in short term memory
    and ability to concentrate, and also show less initiative and enthusiasm
    for life.

    The claims that are made about marijuana are not "health claims", they are
    just claims made about a disappearance of symptoms just like the claims
    about medical drugs that are used to suppress. None of these substances
    cause the original disturbance to disappear, it is just not felt anymore
    and by ignoring it, even new disturbances are added on top. This will have
    consequences far worse than the original disease.
   
    About the Chikey cards:
    The cards seem fine to use except for Insecticides on the first one. He may
    be exposed to a lot of insecticides while travelling, but when you use
    remedies of toxin that will lead to detoxification you also should support
    the Kidneys very well. And treating every day is not right at all.
    Every Chikey program will cause new detoxification and new healing
    impulses. Normally the body works for 3 days on the Chiren/Chikey session
    you have given it. It is not wise to add to the task by giving another
    treatment within those 3 days and at least 1 day of rest would be
    preferable. Advising your client to use the Chikey daily is not according
    to the protocols in your manual.
    Also for his headaches, which are most likely caused by the Gallbladder
    system, remove Meditation Essence and use Atropinum.

    Thank you both for your in depth response.
    Karolina,
    Though I understand that life is always throwing us curves, I am surprised
    by your first comment "even the healthiest person will have some drops." I
    thought that resolving drops and reports of no symptoms were the indicator
    of when the case was complete (more or less) and the goal of Biophoton
    therapy ...getting to the cause and resolving it. I have had several
    clients who did reach a point of "completion." And some have returned later
    with the same recurring symptoms. It sounds as though Biontology in this
    scenario would never really end for a client. This doesn't seem like the
    goal of Biontology as I had understood it. Is Biontology meant to be an
    ongoing type of therapy akin to psychoanalysis? Could you please clarify
    what you meant by this.
    Many thanks,
    Dennis

    Life is not static and the body needs to adapt continuously to all kind of
    fluctuations in the environment. So although ideally "no drops" would be
    the goal, in reality often you will see some slight drops always. But when
    someone is healthy again, you will see them come and go. 

    For example: you ate something with a heavy load of bacteria
   
    Healthy body: The healthy body will still feel a challenge and is put to
    work => the Stomach and Small Intestine may show slight drops => the
    healthy immune function kicks in => bacteria are eliminated + drops
    disappear again
    Dysfunctional body:  The Stomach and Small Intestine show drops => The
    immune system fails and does not respond sufficiently => the infection
    spreads to the Large Intestines, disturbing the Intestinal Flora =>
     possibly an existing appendicitis condition is aggravated => Gallbladder/
    Liver are affected (Metal overacting on Wood..) => etc.

    So as long as the body is not healthy an imbalance/drop is a real problem,
    whereas when a body's immune system has been restored it is just a
    temporary challenge. This is why it is important to continue regular
    treatments until the client's body has become self-sufficient again. 
    Disease in itself is not a problem, and is even healthy once in a while,
    but CHRONIC disease, means the body needs some extra help.

    To tell someone that now they are "fixed for life" after helping him/her
    back to health is an illusion of course. The same reasons for the immune
    system to collapse can be encountered again. A healthy baby is born with a
    perfectly fine immune system (that needs developing at first of course) and
    still at some point chronic disease can happen. When you have really
    completed a case, the disease the client came in with is gone, and the same
    symptoms should not return anymore, but new imbalances can happen always… 

    But this is not the main issue here. The thing is that all needs to add up:
    your measurements, the client's history, the symptoms, the reaction to the
    treatment, the current environmental exposures…. 
    Your client has not been without suppression/endorphins from the first
    treatment on and also has had only few treatments considering his
    background and symptoms. 
    Synthesis thinking is complex and is impossible to explain in one sentence.
    That is why all the above points from Johan and me needed to be given. Just
    read them several times and then things may be more clear as to how to
    integrate all these factors of Biontology.

    Biontology is about restoring the self-regulating ability of the body, and
    is not aimed at "getting rid of disease". 
    Disease is part of health, you cannot have one without the other. The body
    has to restore the balance itself, and then it becomes stronger. 

    When your measurements are mainly balanced after many treatments but there
    are still symptoms or the same symptoms return, the client was not at the
    point of completion yet. When this happens you know that you didn't find
    and address the underlying cause yet.

Neutralization of Sepia

Terry Werner
September 2015 edited September 2015 in General Questions Flag
Client:
Woman who swears that sepia, given to her years ago, was the beginning of her
troubles and wants me to test it on her.  She has given me several little sepia
"balls" to use to neutralize them.

Questions:
1. Is the following procedure correct?
* Put the sepia "balls" in a salt/water or alcohol/water mixture
* Put that solution in the spin inversion cup and an alcohol/water mixture on
the lighted footplate and then run neutralization
* The inverted info is now in the solution on the footplate
* Put that solution in the spin inversion cup.  When the spin inversion cup is
plugged into the Chiren, I can measure on the meridians.

2. What is the salt to water or alcohol to water ratio?
3. What kind of salt and alcohol do I use?
4. Do I need to use distilled water?  I have water from a well and was afraid
if I used that that some of the minerals dissolved in the water might be
neutralized also.
5. How many of these sepia "balls" need to go into how much of the alcohol/
water mixture?  Does the concentration matter?
6. If this invereted sepia does correct drops, ho do I treat with it when I
want to treat her for other things at the same time?  Do I just leave it in the
spin inversion cup and only use 7 remedies in the slots?

    The described procedure is correct. Just make sure the cup is used without
    the spiral.

    However, Sepia is a very common homeopathic remedy that is part of several
    of the support remedies in the Chiren. In the Biontology Remedy Book you
    can find the remedies that contain the higher potencies of Sepia which have
    a neutralizing effect. 
    But I figure the Sepia you are writing about is a homeopathic remedy, which
    already could have been high potency and then the lower potencies Sepia are
    the opposite that you need. 
   
    China Homaccord contains several higher potencies and one low potency. So
    this can be used.

    It is also important that you measure and assess (what are her symptoms?)
    what is really going on. It may just as well be that the Sepia given at the
    time activated/revealed another underlying problem that she just wasn't
    aware of at the time. If this is the case, and it is likely, then the Sepia
    remedy will not do anything, and you just need to treat her according to
    what you find.

    Answers to the other questions:

    2. Physiological salt is sufficient, which is 0,9% salt. Everything above
    is also fine
    Alcohol percentages between 5% and 20% are best.

    3. Table salt. Vodka, Cognac, Ethanol... all is fine
   
    4. Distilled would indeed be best
   
    5. It depends on the energetic quality of the Sepia. So this is hard to
    tell. 
   
    6. Yes, you can just leave the remedy in the cup and fill the slots for
    regular treatment

    What is the effect of putting a homeopathic remedy in the cup for
    neutralization? If the remedy is already homeopathic then it IS inverted,
    as I understand it.  It seems that neutralizing a homeopathic remedy is
    counter intuitive. 
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    September 2015 edited September 2015 Flag
    I agree in that I personally don't see much use in the suggested
    neutralization. 
    However... according to this client this specific homeopathic information
    has damaged her health... 
    I doubt this, but say this is true and the information is still affecting
    her, then neutralizing this specific information, whatever potency, may
    help her. 

    Also, "homeopathic" does not automatically mean that a remedy is already
    inverted. Only the higher potencies above D10 have an inverted action...
  • 
    Terry Werner
    September 2015 Flag
    I also don't think neutralizing sepia will help her.  She has had a lot of
    damage done to her when she was a child by some homeopathic "doctor".  She
    has major digestive issues (among other things) cause by the things this
    "doctor" gave her.  But she is convinced that if I could neutralize the
    sepia, it will help.  So I told her I could measure if it was causing a
    disturbance.  I will of course measure her before treating with it to see
    if it really has any effect.

    Thank you for your help, information and advice.

    I would do the same thing Terry. It is important that the client is taken
    seriously and that you listen. So if she wants this remedy neutralized...
    why not? 
    It will not do any harm, but it also will not resolve the digestive issues.
    This requires nosodes.

Continuing Stomach + Sinus Issues

janjan
February 2013 edited February 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
I need some help with a perplexing case please. Brief Important history. This
boy I saw about a year ago for about 3 months. He had been sick from age 5 to
age 11 and was too sick to go to school, Lyme disease and very weak terrain. He
became well was back in school riding a bike for the first time in a long time,
playing water polo and was feeling great. Went to Europe with his family for
the summer and they were delighted to have their child ”back” after so many
years of illness.

He, several months ago, was hit in the nose accidently with a baseball bat and
broke the nose, had it operated on in the hosp and got MRSA staph His parents
did both antibiotics and I then began treating him for the staph in his nose.
He became well again, and I have not seen him for a while.

Now, many months later he has been having stomach pain, sinus pain and
headaches. Dr said it was a sinus infection. Mother treated with homeopathics
and acupuncture.

Then they called me, I found Staph and Strep - measurements below.. My concern
is he has been having severe stomach pains, more so after treatment, when I ask
him where - he rubs his solar plexis area. Prior to seeing me they saw a
naturopath and they gave him opium homeopathic for the trauma of the broken
nose, he had much worse stomach pains. For the last two treatments with me he
is worse (Stomach) after treatment (But the Stomach meridan shows nothing).

No other symptoms but stomach ache (severe and headache) and facial tics (no
Gallbladder shows up) His Dr. says the tics are from Strep, similar to Lyme. He
is now 12 Could the infection be “stuck” in his sinus (like a baro sinisitus
condition) but toxifying the intestines? I was surprised Staph cleared the
Intestines and no food poisoning, but then I read on the internet Staph and
Strep can be in the Intestines.

Treatment before last one:

Measurement:

Large Intestine (left) - 1b-1

Lungs (left) - Pleura

Lymphatic System (left) - LY1-1 sinus point

Small Intestines (right) -1C

Bladder (right) - 1 point

There was no food poisoning which surprised me

Intestines, Lungs and Lymph all cleared with Strep and Staph
Bladder and Lymph cleared with Sinusitus 

Standard treatment 12 year:

Staphylococcus Aureus, Staphylococcen, Streptococcus Heamolyticus, Sinusitis,
Bact Proteus (Bladder), Echnacea,

Foot plates:

Causticum, Belladonna, Mucosa, Nux Vomica, Anacardium, Solidago,
China, Engystol

After this he still he had stomach ache that night and the next.


Last week's treatment:

Measurement:
Lymphactic System (left) - Sinus point

Lymphactic System (left) - Tonsil point

Large Intestines - L1b1 Lymph & Peritoneum point

Large Intestine (right) - several drops

Bladder (right)


Standard treatment:

Staphylococcae, Streptococcus
Haemolyticus, Sinisitus, Tonsilitis, Tonsillarproepfe, Candida

Footplates:

Lymphomyosot, Belladonna, Mucosa, Nux Vomica, Procranium,
Ubchinon, Populus, China

Switched to Bact Pyo and Bact Coli

He felt great after this treatment, had lots of energy for two days (surprised
me) then felt awful (stomach again) and Friday came home from school and has a
sore armpit (Probably a lymph gland?)

I see him this weekend and appreciate your insight and help.

    Hi Jan,

    Strep and Staph can indeed enter the digestive tract when there's an
    infection in the sinuses or throat. Stomach pain is for example a common
    symptoms of Strep throat.... So you're probably on the right track with
    your treatment.

    However If the Sinuses and Tonsils are affected and also the Large and
    Small Intestines, I think it is unlikely that the "in between section" of
    Stomach and Gallbladder are not infected at all. 
    Even though you don't measure it, I would treat Gallbladder and Stomach.
    Especially since that is where the symptoms are (tics, which always involve
    the Gallbladder meridian/system and stomach pain).

    The pain in the armpit can also be Gallbladder (meridian) related, since it
    runs just anterior to it. I used to have armpit pain when I had Gallbladder
    issues....

    Thank you Karolina. 
    I will treat for Gallbladder and Stomach. The concern of the mom and boy is
    very high now because he "gets worse" after treatments, which I explained
    can happen if one is right on in matching the offender, but he does get
    worse stomach pains after a session.

    Could this possible still be the effect of the homopathic opium in the
    system,  or do you think each time it is a herx. response. It was never
    like this last year with the Lyme, or the Staph infection months ago when
    he had the broken nose.  Perhaps because the staph/Strep is now in the
    stomach that make him "sick feeling" afterward?

    I felt I was using  support remedies to perhaps lessen the stomach ache,
    are there any I have not used that you think may be effective?

    You've only used Nux Vomica and Mucosa for the Gastro Intestinal tract,
    which are support remedies. 

    They are good supports, but since the symptoms show that there are real
    problems with the Stomach and Gallbladder, I would aim for nosodes like
    Ulcus Ventriculi, Gastritis, Billiary Cirrhosis, Cholecystitis....  
   
    and then support remedies for Stomach and Gallbladder (Anacardium (headache
    from the Stomach), Gastricumheel, Chelidionium, Atropinum..)

Gallstones, X-Ray shows no Calcification, what is the Cause?

liselottewliselottew
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
I had Gallstones and treated it with Calculi Billiaris, Calculi Renales,
Cholesystitis and other support remedies for a long period, at least 15 times
maybe more.
It kept on comming up in measurements on the Gallbladder meridian. I went to
the doctor and did an X-ray (Liver, Gallbladder and Kidneys), but she could not
see any stones, which means there are no calcified stones. 

I did 6 Liver cleanses (by dr Hulda Clark, got it from the old forum), and got
out loads of stones and the last cleanse almost none, I have read that you need
to keep cleansing until it's almost no stones comming out. So I hope it was my
last cleanse. Can't stop wondering..

My question is if its not Calcification binding the Cholesterol into stones,
the stones are only Cholesterol stones I guess, what is the cause of the
problem? Because this case there's no calcium in the stones and then the
Parathyroid and a malfunctioning Calcium metabolism can be responsible right? 

I've been measuring Penicillinum and Streptomycin a lot, got loads of that when
I was little. And Rubella many times. Febris Wolhynica. So I now I'm not
missing the cause of these stones and they come back.
Any reason why some bodies are not able to dissolve their own stones with the
treatments? ( I have heard it before, not sure if its accurate)

    I've never recommended the Liver cleanse myself.
    The old forum was not monitored by me.

    Some remedies like Calculi Billiaris you need to use more often than once
    if there really are physical Gallstones. Dissolving physical build-up
    (stones, plaque, calcification, tumours) takes time.

    However if a remedy like Penicillinum or Rubella keeps coming back in your
    measurements, then you know this is not the cause and you have to start
    looking for something else that keeps your body from dealing with those
    issues. If something doesn't resolve and the same point drops again and
    again using the same remedy, you're on the wrong track and you need to find
    a different approach.

    What are your symptoms that you are trying to get rid of?

    The benefits that people get from Liver Flushing is mostly because they get
    the stagnant (thick) bile in Liver and Gallbladder flowing again. Small
    Stones or gravel can be expelled that are calcified if they are present,
    but they don't float and you usually don't notice them. So flushing until
    you don't expel anymore "stones" is not recommended. The flush is very
    stressful for your Liver, Gallbladder and Adrenals. It is better to get to
    the issue that caused the bile to be stagnant in the first place (e.g. low
    fat diet or the wrong fats, artificial hormones, toxins)

    The green goblets (as opposed to the gravel/calcified stones) are formed in
    the Intestines from the mixture of oil, bile and acid that you take and are
    not gallstones. 
    There is an entero-hepatic cycle in your digestive system that prevents
    precious elements (bile salts) from the bile to be expelled with the feces,
    but if you create bile-oil drops and force them to go out of your system
    within a very short time (diarrhea) the bile is all lost and your Liver has
    to work extra hard to create new bile-salts. I can't imagine this being
    healthy for an already sick Liver.

    My personal experience with Gallbladder flushes. One can be beneficial or
    maybe several, but if you then continue it is not healthy at all anymore.
    When you have a healthy Liver and Adrenals your system can endure more, but
    if you don't, flushing can really overburden your system. 
   
    There are other ways that you can find on the internet to get your bile
    flowing again in a more gentle way.

    Gallstones don't always have to be a Parathyroid problem. You're right.

    I dont eat mutch carbs, no bread ,fruits, and sugar. Eat normal amount
    meat, greens with cheese and cream, or sause. Alot of squash, advokado and
    broccoli and other greens. No fruits. Called low carb high fat diet. But i
    dont eat high amount of fat, just good sauses and cheese. I feel better
    when eating this, and i have a bit to much weight on. Swallow in my stomac
    after eating carbs. Do you think its bad eating habits? Witch eating habits
    would you recomend? I eat fat so the bile should float.

    Ok i will not do the cleanse again then.

    Yes,the stones where green and floating. So than its not stones then right?
    I will write my messurments next time.

    You're right those floating things are not the stones ;-).

    Regarding diet, everybody is different. Listening to the body is usually
    what is taught in Biontology and I believe this is the best advise. If you
    have a real Liver issue, eating too much fat will give symptoms. But if you
    have problems digesting too much carbs then a low carb diet is best for
    you. Your body will tell you. 
   
    Fat makes bile flow, but fat also needs bile to emulsify and digest it so
    too much fat can also be too much work for the Liver. Too much cholesterol
    (often in fatty food) and too little fiber can thicken the bile and cause
    stagnation. But also hormonal factors have a big influence on bile quality
    and flow. The balance of the body is so delicate. At one time your body
    needs something that another time is not good at all. 

    The best diet is just to start listening to your body and to observe its
    reactions. 
   
    The only thing that is good for everybody is to eat as natural as possible.
    Organic, whole foods, no additives...

    Great to know.yes it feels right:) Before i had galbladder stones symtoms
    after eating fat. Wanted to womit after eating fat, pain upper back and
    other symptoms . But not those symptoms any more Since the liver cleanses.
    I can eat alot of fat, but choose to eat some.

    Wonderful that you can digest fat again. That shows that you restored your

    cleanses ;-).

    Thank you karolina, 
    very good to know that I don't need that any more.( gallstone flushes) 

    Symptoms: before I had extreme pain/itching and cramping around bladder
    area.It feels like not having enough blood coming through that area.The
    feeling gets much worse by exercising, even walking can start the cramps
    (more pain for 3 days). Can be tired sometimes, diagnosed with Chronic
    Fatigue 10 years ago. 

    Have been using: Lyme's, Calculi Billiaris, Calculi Renales and Gallbladder
    remedies

    Result: It has gotten much better, no more cramps, still some pain /itching
    on skin outside the vagina. 
    This used to be there all the time, now only on waking in the morning even
    when on different hours (8, 9, 10, 11am). 
    The reaction to activity is lessened now. Heat and rest give improvement.
    Also when when I have a fever (because of the higher temperature?)  
   
    I am now eating a lot of potassium rich food. 
   
    Measurement, >12 Program: 
    Veins - Serum Ovile, 
    Large intestines - Appendicitis Necroticans. 
    Large Intestines (right hand) Trichomonaden. 
    Lymphatic - Chronic Tonsilitis, Tonsilitis, Polyp Larynges. 
    Lung - Chlamydia Pneumonia. 
   
    2nd measurement, 2-7 Program: 
    Thyroid,
    Large Intestines,
    Small Intestines, 
    Nervous System, 
    Lung 
   
    All were corrected with Chronic Appendicitis and Appendicitis. 
   
    Last measurement: 
    no drops 
   
    Support, Dyslexia Program:
    measured all of the Bacterial Floras, Anginheel, and Tonsilla Compositum. 
   
    I think it's very odd that Chronic Appendicitis and Appendicitis did not
    match the first time. I've tried them on the point, but this gave a bad
    sound. The second time it gave a good sound on the dropping points. Am I
    doing something wrong or  am I just misunderstanding something?

    It could be that the body decided that something else needed to heal
    first. 

    It sometimes happen that things that I would expect only show up a lot
    later. But we have to remain objective and do all what the body asks for
    when it asks for it.

    Had much more pain last day, cramps, itching and burming feeling.

    New measurements:
    Veins - Aurumheel,
    Arteries - Injeel Chol
    Large Intestines - Appendicitis Necroticans, Chronic Appendicitis,
    Appendicitis, Chronic Tonsilitis, Tonsillitis, Small Intestines -
    Trichomonaden. Tried all nosodes first acording to protocol.

    Liver, Galbladder and Bladder all dropped at the beginning but where
    cleared by the nosodes above.

    2nd measurements:
    Arteries - Barijodeel,
    Lymph, Lung, Large Intestines, Spleen - Toxoplasmosis
    Large intestines - Brucella Abortus Bang
    Small intestines - Gastritis, Duodentits, Ulcus Duodeni, Ulcus Ventriculi

    If I have parasites/worms, how do I know if get all of them out of my body?
    Have been treating a horse with Tuberculinum amd Nux Vomica in water for
    over 6 weeks and other treatments by measurements later. But the horse was
    not well. The vet gave it strong medicine. Not alternative medicine. Out
    came a whole nest with worms. The horse is now energetic first time in 4
    years.

    My question is how do we know we kill/ remove the worms by our treatment?
    Because I did not think there would be any when the owner took it to the
    vet. Because of the 6 week treatment with the water.

    Just a bit worried since I have been treating parasites in myself for some
    periods. The symptom (pain) goes almost away, but not completely. And when
    it itches / pain around anus and vagina especially in the morning. I
    googled some worms and it said it could make it itch, especially in the
    morning around those areas. It feels like I dont get rid of them all the
    way and they starts new infections over again. It seems like it on my
    measurements.

    You do not really know when all the worms are gone. I also do not think you
    kill the worms by the treatment. What I have seen is that they leave the
    body.

    Have you been treating with Tuberculinum and with Tuberculinum Bovinum?

    Do yo have the remedies Ascariden and Oxyuren?

    Yes I have been treating with Tuberculinum alot of times. But it ceeps
    comming up on measurements. 

    A while back Tuberculinum Bovinum matched - I used it then. Have not
    measured it anywhere recently.
    It does not match with Ascariden and Oxyuren. 

    Question:

    Can I treat water with Tuberculinum and Nux Vomica and drink that for a
    longer period, to be more presistant in getting the parasites out?
    And measure and treat the body once a week with the Chiren, or is it to
    much?

    Added information:

    Symptoms: Infection in mouth since a week, Tired, Less Pain/Itching on
    Vagina, Pain after walking 3 minutes.

    Adrenal gland - Selenium 
    Thyroid - Chronic Tonsillitis
    Vein - Pulsatilla 
    Large Intestines - Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis, Brucellosis 
    Large Intestines (left) - Tuberculinum Bovinum 
    Smal Intestines - Hepatitis with EB. (I tried all remedies according to
    protocol first.) 

    Stomach, Lymph, Lung, and Gallbladder were balanced by the nosodes above. 

    2nd measurement:  gave a 2-7 years program with these remedies
    Arteries - Apis 
    Large Intestines (left) - Brucella Abortus Bang. 
    Small Intestines - balanced too
    Large Intestines (right) - Podophyllum
    Lymphatic System - balanced by the above nosodes.

    In the first place I want to inform you that you are doing too many
    treatments in one session.
    With too many treatments, you might be overburdening your body and it might
    stop detoxing because with every remedy you give it different instructions
    and in the end the body might give up all together.
    You only need to give two treatments: the standard one and the dyslexic. 
    That is all.

    The third short treatment in the protocol is only mentioned as an option in
    case at the end of the treatment the Triple Warmer or the Kidneys are not
    corrected. This should however not be the case if you've measured and
    treated for the right remedies in the first two treatments. It is very
    uncommon  to need the third treatment let alone a fourth treatment.

    Also the choice of remedies is all over the place, their is no focus. 
    If there is continuous Appendicitis and Tonsilltis,  it might explain why
    the Turberculosis is so fixed and does not go away.
    It is also possible that the Tuberculinum, a miasm, is fixed by other
    miasms like Luesinum and Medorrhinum.

    Where do you have pain after walking?

    liselottewliselottew
    March 2013 edited March 2013 Flag
    Ok. I will remember. 

    1) What should I focus on then? Or is it that I am measuring wrong then? I
    have had my mom measuring me for a while also, we both measure the same. 

    2) Should I not treat any more after the two first treatments , even if
    there is more drops? As long as the drops is not on the Kidneys and Triple
    Warmer? 

    3) It is pain on the skin of the outsida of the vagina. Itching, burning on
    the skin. 
    It feels like there is no blood going down there, that every muscle cramps
    if I walk.

    Thank you.

    You have pain on the outside of the vagina: what meridian runs there? Liver
    Cramps = Liver and Gallbladder
    Even constriction of blood vessels = Gallbladder.

    From the symptoms I must deduct that Liver / Gallbladder are the problems.

    Focus on these systems, even though they do not seem to drop. It means that
    they might be under heavy stress. Even if you do not measure them, put all
    kind of Liver / Gallbladder nosodes in the slots and then see if they also
    balance the points that do drop.

    Treat with them anyway. Then see what happens.

    Session:

    Measurements:
    Adrenal Glands,
    Lymphatic System,
    Large Intestine (right)
    Veins,
    Stomach,

    Treatment >12 years Program:
    All Liver and Gallbladder nosodes:
    Carcinoma Hepatis Metastasis, Carcinoma Hepatis, Febris Wolhynica,
    Hepatitis A, Hepatitis A non B, Hepatitis with Epstein Barr, Appendicitis
    (nosode under Liver so also used Tonsillitis since I have been working on
    those before)
    Cleared out Lymphatic, Veins and Large Intestine

    Footplate Treatment: 
    Lyme's Disease, Pfeiffer, Q-fever, Adenomyose Gallenblase, Billary
    Cirrhosis, Cholecystitis, Yellow fever, Zirhose hepatis, 

    Measurement: 
    Since I measured something on the Triple Warmer I decided to do a last
    Treatment 2-7 years. Hope that it was ok. 
    Adrenal Gland - Saccharin. I tested all the normal nosodes and support on
    first. Saccharin is a toxin right? so it can match here? 
    Stomach - Kiefostitis. 
    I have a really bad mouth infection. Starting to get better, I treated it
    because I read on the forum by Karolina -that as long as the body has a
    mouth infection it was hard for anything else to heal. 
    Liver - Asbest. 

    Questions:
    1. Should I only focus on the mouth infection untill its gone? Or could I
    proceed as I did? 
    2. Am I using the right Liver and Galbladder nosodes? Since you wrote put
    on all kinds of Liver and Galbladder nosodes. 
    3. Should I do it without Appendicitis and Tonsillitis next time, and see
    if they are dropping after treating with Galbladder and Liver nosodes? 
    4. I do not drink diet drinks any more, many years ago. But I drink, and
    use stevia? Is that bad? I was wondering since I matched Adrenal Gland -
    Saccharin. 

    symptoms: Ice cold, does not matter how much clothes I wear, and later
    sweating alot for a long period. 
    A bit nausea. Much more tired now. Litle less pain. Less swollen in my
    hands I think.

    SOME ADDED INFORMATION TO THE MESSURMENTS ABOWE:

    I was reading another case about how hard it is to get out asbest.

    I was in a stable every day from age 4 to 16 years old. The stable had
    asbest in wals and roof.
    They where cracking up and where removed at last. But sometimes there where
    bits of it in the chavings when I was mucking for the horse.


    QUESTIONS:

    1. Why is it so hard to get out asbest?

    2. Could that be a cause? How would i focus on getting it out , if its so
    hard to get out?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    March 2013 edited March 2013 Flag
    1. The asbest is so hard to get out because the asbest particles are too
    big.

    2. I do not think it is the cause, but it might be. If it is, then you
    should be able to measure it, somewhere in the body. 

    Mouth infections are often caused by Jawbone Infection (Kieferostitis) or
    by Tonsillitis.

    If you are first cold, then hot, the body uses a lot of energy to regulate
    the temperature.You could try Malaria or Yellow Fever.

    Question: Did I understand it right? 

    1. When I am supposed to use all Galbladder and Liver remedies as said
    above do you mean:  Zirrhose Hepatis, Carcinoma Hepatis, carcinoma Hepatis
    Metastasis, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis A non B, Hepatitis B with EB,
    Cholesystitis, Billary Chirrhosis, are those the nosodes you mean?  
   
    2. Do I also need the hepatitis B when I'm using Hepatitis B with EB
    already. 
   
    3. And then see if there is some more drops left? And correct that if
    that's the case? 
   
    Sorry I am slow, just want to know I understand.
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    March 2013 edited March 2013 Flag
    In your specific situation I would advise you to:

    1. First use the Gallbladder nosodes all at the same time in treatment:
    Cholecystitis, Billiary Cirrhosis, Adenomyose Galleblase, Chelidonium,
    Injeel Chol, Berberis, Atropinum. 

    2. Then measure again and see if things start dropping. Then if still
    nothing drops, you wait a few days to let the body work with it. Sometimes
    after a couple of days the Gallbladder does show drops.

    3. After about 4 days you check again. If there are still no drops on the
    Gallbladder, you can try Liver remedies:
    Zirhhose Hepatis, Hepatitis A non B, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis A, Pfeiffer,
    Febris Wolhynica, Hepeel, Galium, Hepar. Try this first. We will see what
    happens.
   
    This is NOT Standard Protocol! I have never done it this way, but since the
    symptoms are clearly Gallbladder symptoms and you are already working on
    yourself for a long time, I suspect that the Liver is holding the
    Gallbladder back from healing.
    I'm very interested to hear your feedback after you've tried this.

    Yes i will try this and will keep you updated. Very interesting. 

    I treated my self after the Refresher course in Rotterdam, by what I
    understood that I should do by recomendations. I might have misunderstood,
    but here are the update of that treatment. 

    Measurement: 
    Lymphatic System, 
    Large Intestines, 
    Lungs, 
    Veins, 
    Arteries, 
    Degeneration meridian, 
    Sexual Glands (TW). 
    Liver, 
    Stomach, 
    Gallbladder, 
    Bladder (vagina). 
   
    Put in Liver and Galbladder remedies: Carcinoma Hepatis Metastasis,
    Carcinoma Hepatis, Zirrhose Hepatis, Adenomyase Gallenblase, Billary
    Cirrhosis, Cholestitis. 
    Measured the drops again with those nosodes in the slots. 
    Corrected: Degenaration points and Circulation points. 
    The rest of the points (Lung, Lymph, Vagina, Sexual Glands, Liver and
    Stomach) were corrected with: Febris Wolhynica  
   
    Treatment >12 Year Program: with all of the above remedies
     
    Measurement: 
    Liver,
    Stomach, 
    Gallbladder 
    Bladder. 
   
    Dyslexia Treatment: 
    Hepatitis B with EB, Pfeiffer, Insecticides. Support: Hepar, Sutoxol. 
   
    Symptoms: naursea, tired, same cramps in vagina area. I will try what you
    said above next treatment and update you.

    5 days since last treatment - Just updated the last treatment a bit late.
    Because I was on the course.
   
    Measurement: 
    Adrenal Gland, 
    Veins, 
    Large Intestines (R), 
    Small Intestines, 
    LungS 
   
    >12 Years Program:
    As adviced: 
    1. First use the Gallbladder nosodes all at the same time in treatment:
    Cholecystitis, Billiary Cirrhosis, Adenomyose Galleblase, Chelidonium,
    Injeel Chol, Berberis, Atropinum. 
   
    Measurement after this: 
    Parathyroid & Thyroid dropping steeply => Whiplash Treatment on neck. 
   
    Footplate Treatment:
    Parathyroid (still dropping) - Serum Olive. 
    Adrenal Gland - Carcinoma Uteri 
    Large Intestine (R) - Carcinoma Coli. 
    Lymph (ear point) - Staphylococcen Aureus 
    Liver - Febris Wolhynica 
    Cartilage - point under joint close to foot on both feet - Platinum. 
   
    Support: Hepar 
   
    Questions:
    1. Now the liver was dropping from the beginning. I wanted to do as you
    said with Gallbladder remedies to be sure. But next time if I can measure
    the Liver, should I just follow normal protocol? 
    2. On Cartilage Meridian, what does it mean when I measure Platinum? 
    3. I measured under and over each joint, but I am not quite sure where the
    points are supposed to be on the Cartilage Meridian? 
    4. Should I treat myself again 1 week from now as normal, since it showed
    drops on Liver?

    1. Yes if you can measure, you should follow protocol and measure for
    remedies. If the Liver is dropping try to match nosodes only. if the
    Gallbladder is dropping as well, see if the Liver remedies also correct the
    Gallbladder. But first try to balance the Triple Warmer. 

    2. Platinum most people get from inhalation of toxic fumes generated by
    cars. It is also regarded as heavy metal and can go to the Bones and
    Vertebrae.

    3. The points are on the same places as with other meridians, so you did
    well

    4. Just follow the normal protocol

    Lung - Streptococcae Haemolyticus 
    Liver - Febris Wolhynica. (corrected Veins also)

    Cartilage meridian? Does it effect the nerves going down through my spine,
    down to the sexual glands?

    - 5 points?

    really ill in Thailand last year. Laid in bed for months with nausea.
   
    4. I felt very tired the next day. I measured and had a Spin Inversion.
    Treated it, measured some points and there where dropping point again. Do I
    treat the same program as yesterday again? Or measure out everything again?
    Or do I just treat Spin Inversion and wait a week before treating again.
    Been trying to rest and take it easy. Recently taken out spiral bed and
    replaced it with mattress without spirals.

    I still had some questions above. 

    Measurements and Treatment (>12): 
    Pituitary, 
    Thyroid, 
    Veins (2 first points from palm), 
    Large Intestines (L - first point from palm) 
    Lymphatic System (L - 2 first points from palm), 
    Nervous System (L - all points), 
    Large Intestines (R - first after palm), 
    Liver (L - 2 first points from foot), 
    Pancreas (1 points from foot), cartilage (L) 4th from nail - Salmonella
    Typhi
    Cartilage - Calcoheel
    Rest of the points corrected by PCB 
    Support: Lymphomyosot, Hepar. 

    Measurement: 
    No correction of points. => Hidden Spin-Inversion. I did Spin Inversion
    Treatment treatment. 

    2-7 year Program: with Energy Remedies: Aletris, Cocculus, Selenium,
    Berberis, Tonico, Ozaliet, China.
    >12 year Program: again with the same remedies. 
   
    2nd measurement & Footplate Treatment: 
    Arteries (R - first point from palm) - Yellow Fever
    Liver (L - 2nd and third point from nail) - Yellow Fever
   
    Support: Sutoxol. 
   
    All drops corrected. 
   
    Improvement: Ear has itched less the last week. Has not itched yet today
    after last treatment. I feel an increased Circulation around Sexual Glands
    after the treatment. But it does not stay as good Circulation through the
    hole week. Overall I experience less pain and cramps around Sexual Glands. 
   
   
    I have been switching treatments with a therapist this week. the other
    therapist (Cranio-sacral) has looked over my spine. 
    She says the last vertebras in my lower spine are pushed together. With
    pressure on the nerves that goes down towards the Sexual Glands. She Says
    its really Swollen on Lower Spine. She could almost not feel the verbetras
    in that area at first. She suspects the swelling is caused by an
    Inflammation. 
    I have fallen of crazy horses all my life, big accidents. This therapist
    has worked on getting the spine straightend out, in a very soft way. If
    felt better in the days afterwards with the pain around Sexual Glands and
    the Circulation. If this is not appropriate information on the forum,
    pleace remove this part off the post. :) 
    Questions: 
    1.Can I do something with Chiren to treat this? Get the swelling down? How
    do I do this? 
    2. Am I treating it a bit through treating the Cartilage with Calcoheel? 
    3. Should I support the Cartilage with something else? Looking foward to
    your respons. 
    Very curious.

    1. Measuring Osteoheel on the Cartilage meridian, means that somewhere in
    your joints calcium is needed. possibly in your spine but it could also be
    anywhere in your bones. The exact meaning of the points is not known.

    2. The points are on the same locations on every meridian (above and under
    the joints)

    3. If the Liver releases the disease, one time would be enough. If
    something is holding it in place, you might find it more often. But in that
    case I would also look at something else.  
    The Liver holds many Toxins. It is impossible and unnecessary to have
    something for every possible toxin.

    The Chiren is great in treating functional problems. If the functional
    problems have lead to structural problems, it becomes more difficult. But
    for structural issues, like arteriosclerosis, you might find Baryodeel
    matching a number of times, depending on how bad it is. We can see that it
    is there, but we can not see how much calcium has been deposited.

    4. feeling tired the days after a treatment is normal, also without a Spin
    Inversion.
    what remedies you use after treating for Spin Inversion, depends at what
    point in time you got it. When the body gets into a Spin Inversion, right
    after you have treated, you can use the same remedies. If the body goes
    into a Spin Inversion, the treatment stops working so you might still need
    the same remedies.
    Why have you waited so long to change your mattress?

    1. You can try to reduce the swelling with Lympholyosot and
    Hamamelis,perhaps Apis

    2 & 3 Treat the Cartilage with Discus. You will have to treat with this
    quite a few times. The Discs have to build up again.

    3. I read about Yellow fever on google. The symptoms where same as I got
    after treating my self with Yellow fever. And the symptoms shows after
    treatment for many days (more symptoms after treatment). 
    So I guess I am unmasking and the body is working with it? 
   
    Symptoms after my last treatments: Ice cold (no matter what cloths I put
    on), coughing, runny nose, nausea. It is the first time I measure only the
    Yellow Fever. Before it was Febris wolhynica also. But did not measure it
    the last treatment. So it feels like my body is working hard. 
   
    Could PCB, which I measured on Liver hold the Liver back from healing the
    Yellow fever? Or should I look for something else on Liver the next time?
    If it's there. 
   
    I have messured and treated with Barijodeel in the past. Don't measure it
    anymore. The Vein points correct after the Liver is corrected. 
   
    1. I will try. Can I do this more often than once a week? To keep the
    swelling down? Can I use any remedies in the slots in the Scar Treatment to
    get the swelling down? And if - how often could I do this? 
   
    2 & 3 Yes I will use Discus in my next treatments. Very intressting. When I
    stretch my lower back on my yoga ball the pain around Sexual Gland goes
    away. For some hours. If I sleep on the side, in fetal position (stretching
    back), I almost have no pain around Sexual Glands when I wake up. I always
    woke up by the pain before I tested this. I was not aware of how important
    it was to change my mattress to one without metal. I slept so well on it.
   
   
    Much appreciated advice. I am adding information to the questions above.

    New Measurements:
    Insulin (L)
    Adrenal glands
    Large intestines(L - all points)
    Lung (L - all points)
    Lymphatic System (L - all points)
    Smal Intestine (R - all points)
    Sexual Glands (hormonal- R)
    Large intestines(R - point near palm)
    Liver (L - 2,3,4th point from nail)
    Cartilage (L and R)
    Stomach (L -4th from nail)
    Liver (R - 2,3 from nail)
    Stomach (R - 4th from nail)
    Skin (R)

    >12 year program
    Yellow Fever => all points corrected with this except Cartilage which
    measured for Discus and Osteoheel.
    Support: Calcoheel, Apis, Hamamelis, Lymfomyosot.

    2nd Measurement:
    Arteries (L - 4th from nail)
    Large Intestines (L - 2 points after palm)
    Lung (L - 4th from nail)
    Lymph (R + L - Ear)
    Small Intestines (R - 2 points after palm)
    Insulin points (R)
    Arteries (R - 2nd from nail)
    Large Intestines (first point after palm)
    Liver (L) 3 points
    Liver (R - one point)
    Pancreas (point close to foot)

    Footplate Treatment:
    All points corrected by Febris Wolhynica.
    Support: Hepar, Belladonna, Arnica,

    After treatment no more drops.

    Results/Symptoms past week:
    Still itching in ears. Ice cold 3 days after treatment. Coughing, runny
    Nose, Nausea, Swollen Lower Back, Really bad Skin, Greakouts-normally have
    good Skin. Less Pain, more Circulation around Sexual Gland. As long as I am
    not moving, walking, started to wake up some times every night, did not do
    that before. Around 5- 6 AM (I think Large Intestines time)

    Questions:
    1.Why am I still measuring Febris Wolhynica and Yellow Fever? Since I have
    measured it some times I am affraid that I am missing something or should
    be matching the points with something else? Any thing else I can try to
    measure instead?
    2. Under Liver in the protocol it says Toxins. I have tried those the ones
    under airborne toxins under Pituritary gland. I might be missing to measure
    out some Toxins here mayby. I have also tried => Penicillum, Steptomycinum,
    Saccharin, Cortison and Asbest. Are there more Toxins I should try out?

    1. You can try Malaria or Arsenicum Album
    2. There are a few toxins left that you didn't mention: PCB, Parafinum,
    Dioxin, Formaladehyde

    1. Malaria did not match. Idid not have Arsenicum on my chiren. I tried
    writing 1/ Arsenicum on a pice of paper , put it in the cup and messure it.
    I dont think it corrected theliver points.


    2. I have tried all these nosodes, as they where mentioned under the
    pituratry gland as airborn toxins.

    Symptoms:itching ears. Waking up just before 4 a clock. Never done this
    before.Lung time. Runny nose, cramps.

    Messured spinn:all 6 points dropping. Treated with spinn inversion. Points
    corrected.

    12 year program:
    Lymph-Otis media
    Liver-Varicellen, zirrhose hepatis
    Cartilage- Discus
    Supported with energy remedies.

    Footplate treatment:
    Lymph and bladder-sexual gland- Pyrogenium.
    Degenerative- Glyoxal.
    Cartilage- Osteoheel
    Hepar, lymfomyosot

    Questions:

    1. Can I messure Arsenicum as 1/arsenicum on a pice of paper in the cup. To
    se if it corrects points? And if it corrects drops- use it on the 12 year
    program. Or do I need a card with the Arsenicum remedie on it to get
    arsenicum in the chiren?

    2. For weeks it has been itching inside of my ears. And i do not seam to
    have found the right nosode to correct it. It itches most when I am going
    to sleep and at night. I tried all staphylococ ans strepto, chlam p,
    klebesilla penomnia, tuberkulinum, bacterie flora , aliminium , pertussis
    on the lymph merridian , but they do not correct it. It sounded like the
    nosodes today corrected it. but it still itches a bit some times after
    treatment. So I am not sure. Any idea of some others nosodes I can try ?

    3. If the varicellen does not correct the liver untill next time. I would
    have to try a new nosode right? Any ideas for other nosodes to match on
    liver. I have tried all under liver on protocol and on chiren photon
    highway,

    What about trying Psorinum for itchy ears?

    There are also several Support Remedies that might be useful against such a
    nasty thing. 

    Nux Vomica, Pulsatilla and Graphitis are support remedies for itchy ear at
    nightime. 

    There are lots if remedies for all kind of scratching ears , many we have
    in Chiren.

    1. Arsenicum Album is part of Mezereum

    3. Since the Liver is part of so many processes it can influence and be
    influenced by almost anything... When you have tried all usual suspects,
    you can continue testing for something else...

    Heart - Streptococcus Viridans
    Liver - Zirrhose Hepatis

    Local Whiplash/Scar Treatment around Lower Abdomen with Variolinum (my
    boyfriend had Herpes, but has not had symptoms in the last year)

    Footplates:
    Hepar, Lymfomyosot ,Tonsilla Compositum, Chelidonium, Mucosa 
   
    Questions: 
    With others I do get results, but not with myself. This time I was measured
    by my mother, because it is difficult to measure myself. 
    After treating myself with Yellow Fever I was better for a week, but right
    now that doesn't match. 

    Symptoms: Cramps around Sexual Glands worse, Itching in Ears returned
    (improves when they are warm under a blanket), Night Sweats (this night),
    Light Stools 1 day after Treatment, Urine changes between light coloured
    and dark coloured, Stools are light in colour, but this also goes back and
    forth. 
    Symptoms improved after Treatment for a day, but then got worse again.
   
    1. What does this mean? 
   
    2. Any ideas how to proceed?
   
    3. Do the light Stools mean the Liver was not corrected by the last
    Treatment?

    1. Tonsilltis and Appendicitis seem to be a recurrent problem. This also
    means that the Intestinal Flora is a problem. It might cause continuous
    Infections everywhere. 

    2. Try to concentrate on the Liver and the Intestinal flora.

    3. Light Stools indicate the Liver does have problems or it also depends on
    what you have eaten. My experience is when eating Vegetables, the Stools
    will turn darker.

    Itchy ears? This is terrible, and It is possible to get desperate when
    tried almost everything :-)

    Did you try my last suggestions? I believe you have tried everything there
    is in the Chiren?

    1. Rinse ears two days in a row with olive oil (room temperature). Turn ear
    upwards and work a bit on it with your hands, while oil is dripping in.
    Keep the position for 10 min. on each side.
    Dirt will come out and remove it with a soft cloth (never use cotton
    swabs).

    2. Rinse ears with apple cider vinegar and water (same method as with oil).
    This might help you to get rid of bacterias in the ear as well. Do this
    frequently as you need it. Drinking unfiltered apple cider vinegar is
    useful.

    Measurements of me by my mother:

    1st Session

    >12 Year Program:
    Thyroid - Pertussis
    Large Intestines - Appendicitis, Febris Wolhynica
    Lymphatic System - Psorinum
    Lung - Streptococcus Viridans
    Nervous System - Formaldehyde
    Degeneration Meridian - Polyp Nasalis

    Footplates:
    Liver - Yellow Fever
    Support:
    Intestinal Flora + Hepar

    Reactions:
    Less itching in ears!
    Much more energy.
    Less pain and cramps around sexual glands,
    Less spots on face.

    2nd Session after 5 days:

    Measurement of my Legs: one was much shorter...
    I learned it wrong in the Basic Course, and misunderstood earlier
    explanations on the Forum. The last explanation I realized I had done it
    wrong. So I did the Leg Treatment.

    Result: Finally my Legs were even at the end of the Treatment and I felt
    like something started moving again and I had much better Circulation in
    the Legs. They were much warmer.
    My Legs and area around the Sexual Glands still hurt after some minutes
    when walking, but less than before.

    Measurement:
    Almost all points dropped.
    Spin Inversion Treatment and Whiplash Treatment did not correct it.

    >12 Year Program:
    Pituitary + Parathyroid - Variolinum
    Thyroid - Chronic Tonsillitis
    Insulin Points - Formaldehyde
    Large Intestine - Salmonella Typhi
    Lymphatic System - Schwefheel
    Spleen - Brucelosis
    Cartilage - Osteoheel

    Footplates: 
    Parathyroid - Variolinum again!!!  

    I don't understand why this would match again. I have treated it before in
    other treatments too. I did a Whiplash on the front of the troath with
    variolinum in the slots. As I have read on the forum that Johan has done
    this with Diphertia when it did not heal. Is this wrong? None of the other
    nosodes matched on Parathyroid.... 
   
    Large Intestine - Botulism
    Small Intestines - Ulcus Ventriculi
    Bladder - Cystopyelonephritis  
    Degeneration Meridian - Carcinoma Hepatis Metastasis
    Cartilage - Discus
   
    Support:
    Anginheel, Tonsilla Compositum, 
    Last 8 minutes switched to: Hepar, Lymphomyosot 
   
    Questions: 
    1. How many times can I repeat the leg treatment if the legs are not
    completly even.? 
    2. Why would Variolinum match on Parathyroid after I used it on the first
    treatment and in other treatments before. Am I maby using wrong nosode? Or
    can I treat it the way I did?
    3. When the Spine and Discs are effected and walking without hurt is
    impossible, how many treatments on the Cartilage Meridian would be needed 
    with Discus and Osteoheel? 
    Or is surgery often needed instead? Are there other support remedies witch
    should be added?

    In order to determine what situations influence me negatively, I did
    several measurements:
   
    Measurement lying in bed: 
    Dropping Points 
   
    I have a phone without SIM card lying 2 meters from the bed as a wake-up
    device.
    Measurement with Phone removed:
    No drops

    The Solar Panel close to my head didn't seem to have a negative effect.
    Without the phone the measurements were fine.

    My boyfriend can sleep without a watch thats why I had it. I have now
    bought a hand watch with alarm in it. That will lay on his side of the
    bed. 

    Measurement in the Sofa (Spirals): 
    Dropping points. 
    Measurement with Sheep Skin on the Sofa:
    No drops.
    Measurement with Sheep Skin on the Sofa and TV on:
    No drops. 

    Measurement with WIFI on:
    Dropping Points everywhere I was in the house. So no more WIFI for now....

    My bed is over 5 meters from the fuse box.
    I changed my bed so it has no spirals a while ago. But my boyfriend wants
    to keep his. But I guess it wont affect me. Except for the screws, my bed
    is completely wooden :) 
   
    Measurement sitting in the (operating) car: 
    Dropping Points
   
    Measurement in the care while sitting on Sheep Skin: 
    No drops 
   
    Hoping my body can better heal with this changes. If anybody has some ideas
    of something I missed in my environment, I would appriciate them telling me
    about it.:)

    1. If the tension in the leg is coming back all the time, then you'll have
    to consider what causes this tension.

    2. Try Varicellen, any other Childhood Disease can match too.

    3. How many treatments are necessary varies greatly. Always support the
    healing of the Discs with Bladder Support. (Bladder Meridian runs alongside
    of the Spine/Discs)

    Been on vacation on Lanzarote. 

    I have been treating with Barijodeel, Aurumheel on Arteries a lot. I have
    measured these remedies on the Arteries for some time.
    The measurement has not been this bad for a long time. A lot more drops
    show now, but I have been on vacation too.

    Symptoms:
    Recent (4 days) - Stabbing pain in urine tract, but not when peeing.
    Longer issue - Ice cold feeling every night between 11PM - 3AM. So cold it
    hurts in my legs and arms.
    Waking up soaked in sweat.

    Measurement:
    Hormone System (L) - almost all points
    Heart (L) - 1 point
    Small Intestine (L) - almost all points
    Nervous System (L) - 1 point
    Large intestine (L) - all points
    Lung (L) - 1 point
    Lymphatic System (L) - 1 point

    Hormone System (R) - all points but Epifyse
    Heart (R) - almost all points
    Small Intestine (R) - all points
    Large Intestine (R) - all points
    Lung (R) - 1 point (3rd from nail)
    Lymphatic System (R) - 2 points (1st + 4th point from nail)

    Stomach (L) - 1 point
    Galbladder (L) - nail point
    Bladder (L) - 2 points (1st + 4th from nail)

    Liver (R) - 1 point (3rd from nail)
    Stomach (R) - 1 point (4th from nail)
    Bladder (R) - 2 points (1st + 4th from nail)

    Treatment:
    Whiplash treatment => no effect.

    >12 year program:
    Poliomyelitis (Epifyse),
    Anti Tetanus (Parathyroid),
    Thyroidea (Thyroid),
    Ovarium (Sexual Glands),
    Appendicitis Necroticans (Large Intestines left),
    Chronic Tonsillites (Lymphatic System)
    Cystopyelonephritis, Bact Proteus (Bladder)

    => No corrected points after = might be hidden Spin Inversion

    => Spin Inversion program
    => treated whiplash again => no effect
    => >12 year program again

    2nd Measurement:
    Parathyroid
    Sexual Glands
    Kidneys
    Large Intestine
    Small Intestine
    Nervous System (point after nail)

    Footplates:
    Varicellen (Parathyroid)

    Bact. Lactis (Kidneys)
    Leptospirose (Small and Large Intestine)
    Variolinum (Nervous System)

    Bact Coli, Bact Pyo, => added because I measured the other 2 were in wrong
    places. Switched them to Anginheel, Solidago the last 4 minutes.

    3rd measurement:
    No drops

    Questions:
    1a. Did I use too many nosodes? 
    1b. What nosodes should I have ignored?
   
    Varicellen and Variolinum showed up again, although I have treated it in
    the past. 
    2a. My boyfriend has Herpes. Do we need to get treated for it at the same
    time to get it out? 
    2b. How can I completely get rid of it?
    2c. Can I become reinfected otherwise?

    Were your measurements the same after the Spin Inversion treatment?

    Symptoms as well as the location of the pain and the timing of the cold
    indicate the cause of the problem to be Liver/Gallbladder, which could be
    caused by anything, but definitely the Intestines are involved.. 
    The Intestines and Gallbladder need to be corrected before you address the
    Liver. 

    Answers:
    1a. There are indeed too many nosodes 
    1b. Appendicitis Necroticans influences a lot of Organ Systems at the same
    time including the Hormone System. When you find so many points dropping
    (after Spin Inversion and/or Whiplash are excluded or treated), it makes
    sense to put Appendicitis Necroticans in and see what it corrects. It might
    be that points on the Hormone System that now needed to be corrected with
    other nosodes would have been corrected just by this single remedy. (you
    have already treated Polio and Anti-Tetanus in the past…)
    When you get a picture like this with severe Appendicitis and Tonsillitis
    this needs to be your main focus first. And support should reflect this…
    The Intestinal Flora Bacteria will only be helpful after the inflammation
    is gone. 
    You don't have symptoms of Herpes right now, so in this stage you should
    leave it and focus on the Appendicitis and Tonsillitis to improve the
    underlying condition of your body.

    2a. When your boyfriend has symptoms of Herpes, don't kiss or have sex.
    2b. You can get rid of the symptoms and the harmful effects of the virus
    completely by getting your immune system to work effectively again. But
    there is no way to tell whether viruses are ever eliminated completely from
    the body, they might remain dormant forever without causing symptoms, but
    they might also be eliminated. We just don't know. 
    But remember that healthy people are never bacteria/virus/parasite/
    fungus-free! They are all part of our eco-system.
   
    For treatment of Herpes, Variolinum is the main remedy to use.

    Thank you. I did not know that I needed to measure again to see if the same
    points dropped after treating a Hidden Spin Inversion. I only did that with
    a "normal" Spin Inversion. 

    Treatment:
    Since the last update I have been treating myself with the different
    Appendicitis and Tonsillitis nosodes, and Tuberculinum. The Thyroid was
    often dropping too, as well as the Parathyroid. 
   
    Results:
    Measurements, inflammation and colds improved after treatment, but they
    never go away completely and re-appear. 
    It seems like something is causing reinfection, blocking the way to
    complete healing of the inflammation.
   
    Symptoms today: 
    Ice cold feeling in legs and hands, 
    Sweaty palms. 
   
    Today's treatment:
    Chronic Appendicitis and Chronic Tonsillitis => after this I measured
    Appendicitis on the Large Intestines (normal I guess).
    The Thyroid still drops, but nothing listed in the Measurement Protocol
    seems to match. 

    Results:
    Symptoms went away after treating with the Chronic Appendicitis and Chronic
    Tonsillitis, but stabbing pains appeared in the Large Intestines area over
    my left hip. The pain subsided a bit after I treated with Appendicitis and
    Supports also. 

    Supports: Arnica, Chelidonium, Tonsilla Compositum, 

    Drops on Kidney , Liver, and Lymphatic System where corrected by the
    above. 

    Questions:
    1. What could hold the Tonsillitis, Appendicitis, and the Thyroid back from
    healing? 
    I have tried Polyp Larynges and Polyp Nasalis without result. 
   
    2. What other remedies, not listed in the measurement protocol, could I
    possibly measure on the Thyroid?

    3. Are sweaty and cold palms/feet always caused by Tuberculinum? And is it
    an indicator of parasites, or actual TB?

    Update:

    Symptoms:
    Legs and arms cold,
    Hands/feet sweat,
    Tired, but warmer in the morning,
    Ice cold-flu chills in the evening.
    Itching in ears.
    Itching vagina.

    Measurement after 3 days:
    Thyroid,
    Parathyroid,
    Lymphatic System,
    Large Intestines,
    Bladder,
    Liver

    >12 yrs Program:
    Tuberculinum (corrected all drops again)

    Footplates:
    Nux Vomica, Lymfomyosot, Solidago, Galium.

    No drops after.

    Reaction to treatment:
    Get warm immediately after treatment + sweating all over body.
    Sweating on hands/feet almost gone
    Itching in ears gone.
    Bobbeling sounds in stomach.

    So all symptoms are gone after. But the next days the symptoms come back
    later in the day.

    Questions:
    Can you answer my previous questions too?
    4. Tuberculinum seems the only Remedy that has a big effect on the
    Symptoms.
    I know I should not treat two days in a row, but the symptoms were so bad
    that I had to do something. Is this OK in my situation?

    5. What I understand of Tuberculinum is that it makes the environment
    unappealing to Parasites so they want to get out. Is this right, and could
    this be the situation here?

    6. Probably the treatment is not according to protocol, but do the results
    of my treatment give you a clue as to what is going on?

    7. Why does it help so much when it is not according to protocol….

    Answers:
    1. Tonsillitis and Appendicitis could be held back by Jaw issues, which can
    be measured on the Stomach meridian. You could also try bacterial nosodes.
    The Intestinal Bacteria could also cause the problem. Or affected Organ
    Systems could keep infecting each other again and again.

    3, 4, 5 Sweaty or cold palms are a symptom of TB, but not exclusively.
     According to the similarity principle, Tuberculinum can work on these
    symptoms without you actually having this infection.
    Tuberculinum can fit anywhere in the protocol, and it has a lot of effects
    everywhere in the body. 
    You can never base a diagnosis on this measurement/treatment.

    6 & 7 If the symptoms come back, it means that the Cause (e.g. Jaw
    problems) of the Symptoms has not been addressed. The Symptoms have only
    been temporarily relieved. So I would not point this out as having Results.
    The stabbing pains in the left abdominal area are likely to be caused by
    gas formation. Gas formation is caused by Gallbladder.
   
    How is your Jaw condition?

Hand Crystals

SVitale
March 2015 in Technical Questions Flag
I have one hand crystal that the fiber optic fits loosely in it and often falls
out.  I notice that there is a metal tab inside that holds it and it is in need
of a greater angle so that the cable fits more snugly.  Is there a way of
removing the metal collar in order to get at the metal to bend it a little?

Be Careful with Dental "Solutions"

    Oil pulling
    According to one holistic dentist I have seen, oil pulling should not be
    attempted by anyone with old amalgam fillings lest it expose tissues to
    heavy toxins, like mercury.

    Removing amalgam fillings
    Before anyone has amalgam fillings or metal dental work removed, it is
    important they do some research. I found Dr Mercola's site useful to better
    compare the composites commonly used. It is important to check patient
    reviews and backgrounds of dentists, too. Be careful the detox regimen some
    dentists recommend before and after the procedure are right for your
    patient.

    Titanium and mercury
    One German doctor, Dr. Joachim Mutter, believes the mercury in amalgam
    fillings plays a role in Alzheimer's, Autism, and EHS, among other things.
    His research has shown that titanium reacts with mercury to form an even
    more lethal form of mercury. Other elements may also interact with mercury
    in amalgam leading to high concentrations of toxins in the body.

    Question, I seem to have finally found a good holistic dentist to remove
    amalgam. The question I have is whether I should take the remedies he
    suggests to prepare for my procedures. He gave me water in which he added
    some frequency, and two formulas below:

    Formula 1
    Allium cepa
    Allium Sativum
    Ambrosia artemisaefolia
    Berberis vulgaris
    Carduus marianus
    Chelidonium maius
    Collinsonia canadensis
    Cynara scolymus
    Petroselinum sativum
    Trifolium pratense

    Formula 2
    Aceticum acidum
    Adenosine triphosphate
    Alpha lipoicum acidum
    Citricum acidum
    Coenzyme A
    DNA
    Fumaricum Acidum
    Lacticum Acidum
    Nicotinamide adenine
    dinucleotide
    Oxalicum acidum
    RNA
    Succinum acidum

    Typing these in, I think I already know the answer. My guess is these are
    added information--Formula 2 seems to be nutritional supplements--that are
    not recommended by biontologists as they have not been measured and are
    only adding more instructions.

    Be interested to hear comments on the homeopathic remedies selected. These
    seem to be bottled by a distributor. They were not customized perse for me.
   
    I am torn--he seems to be technically proficient to handle the surgery
    aspect.
   
    I remember Johan recommending some remedies to possibly use post-treatment
    in another discussion thread here.

    Put these remedies in the cup en treat yourself with them in a 2-7 program.
    This way the biophoton resonance filter will prevent any possible
    disturbing effect the remedies may have.

    The dentist would like me to treat myself with the remedies mentioned above
    for 30 days, 2X day, orally (a few drops each time). He also wanted me to
    separate the two at least 10 minutes apart.

    Question
    1 Should I run the 2-7 program once every day for 30 days with remedies in
    the cup?  
    2 I think it is ok to drink a few drops of the programmed water programmed,
    or should I also administer that daily via the cup and 2-7 program?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    October 2015 edited October 2015 Flag
    Answer
    1 & 2 I think you best take both remedies via the Chiren and not every day,
    but following the Chiren instructions, every five days. The Chiren
    treatment continues to work for 3 days and is more powerful than just
    taking information orally. 

    However...
    I have noticed that many people get a lot of health problems AFTER they
    have their amalgam removed, even if they did not experience much before.

    IF you have problems with your fillings, these are probably caused by the
    electrical currents that flow between the fillings. Every filling has its
    own electrical potential. If the currents are too high, the filling becomes
    unstable and it starts leaking. Different metals have different potential,
    also there is a big difference between the various sizes of fillings. But
    it is only a danger if the difference is too big.

    If the difference is small, it is better to leave the filings. Then they
    probably do not leak and little harm is done. But if you remove them there
    may be a sudden poisoning with the metals entering your lymphatics which
    can cause serious problems. Often dentists do not suck away the metals
    sufficiently. 

    If you do not do anything and the fillings are stable, then there is no
    problem...

    Thank you very much, Johan. I have held off from taking anything because I
    understand how adding any information into the body can create
    disturbances, but in this case I do very much want to follow through with
    dentist's recommendations.

    My mercury fillings are causing many problems due to their toxicity and
    placement in my mouth. From my understanding, mercury leaks from these
    every day from chewing, grinding, drinking hot or bubbly liquid, exposing
    them to excessive RF, and if they are not in top condition. I am getting
    physical pains and disturbances in my filled teeth and ear, especially in
    the presence of strong RF. This dentist believes a head concussion I
    suffered in 2013 is likely responsible for a jaw fracture that quite soon
    after led to the loss of a top molar with root canal. A CT scan soon after
    the concussion immediately led to a bout of ear pressure which next
    developed into ear pulsing and electrosensitivity.

    A panorex xray happily confirmed there are no pins in my jaw from a
    long-ago surgery. There are quite a few amalgams on one side of my jaw
    which may be creating a very strong electric current with other metal
    implants. Up until now, I believe these metal implants have blocked Chiren
    treatment and even caused me some sensitivity to the gold electrode.

    I am eager to follow up my surgeries with a full course of Chiren
    treatment. 

    This holistic dentist does use kinesiology, which I understand from this
    Forum is subject to the dentist's own projection. However, Dr. Mark Breiner
    seems to have the right amount of experience, satisfied patients (one an
    acquaintance), and a real desire to help patients and advocate for safer
    dentistry. I suppose I am impressed that any American medical doctor cares
    so much at the risk of his own standing and tries to do the right thing. He
    has written an informative book: "Whole Body Dentistry" with parts I found
    interesting- and others I am not so quick to agree with.

    I am grateful to have received Biontology training and to have developed a
    different view of how the body works and how to approach healing. I am
    hoping if I continue to carefully listen to what my body wants, I will be
    able to get through this ok. But, yes, mercury is not something to take
    lightly. I intend to take every precaution.

    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    October 2015 edited October 2015 Flag
    In your case it sounds like you are making a proper decision that was not
    taken lightly. The fillings appear to be very damaging and there may be no
    other way than to risk taking them out. I am just glad you found a good
    dentist.

    It is important for others to understand that not everyone with amalgam has
    the same issues and that taking radical measurements by taking the fillings
    all out may create more damage than it does do good. It is a case by case
    decision that needs to be made.

    Good luck, and if you want to, let us know how things went. Dental issues
    are often a big problem for clients and it is good to learn from
    experiences with dental procedures.

Intestinal Flora & Intervals of Treatment

m3pollack
February 2013 edited February 2014 in General Questions Flag
I have a client who contracted Bell's Palsy about 3 years ago.  I have worked
at clearing everything that comes up, focused on her gallbladder a lot and her
digestive system.  She was in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit as a premie for
SEVEN MONTHS!  

I am surmising that the antibiotics at such a young age negatively impacted her
digestive system and her immunity.  I also have read that Herpes Zoster is
usually at the base of Bell's Palsy.  Also, because she was intimated for
months as a premie, her vocal cords were badly scarred and she sounds like
someone with a bad case of laryngitis. Here are my questions:  

1) now that most of her digestive points have cleared, can I put in the 4 good
bacteria? 
2) how often and at what intervals? 
3) how often and at what intervals shall I put in the Herpes Zoster?
4) how often and at what intervals shall I do the scar treatment on her throat
(which I've already begun)?
5) how long do you think the throat scars will take to resolve?

Thanks so much for your response. ~Miriam

    1. You would have to measure, and if it matches on the Large intestine it
    is good to treat her with it. Ask the body and go with the answer. 

    2. A person can be treated every 5th day not more often, because of the
    need for the body to recover and rest, in order not to overload the body. 
   
    3. Every 5th day not more often, and you treat with the minimum number of
    Nosodes what you find to match the most drops. If  Herpes Zoster match the
    drops, treat with it, if not try another Remedie according to drops. 
    I can't give you more clarity since I do not know where the drops are. 
   
    4. Scarr treatments are done once to correct the meridian flow, but can be
    treated more regularely if you treat for the scarr to diminish in
    appearance. 
   
    Onternal scarrs can be treated with Scarr treatment + the remedie
    Procrainum.

    Hi Miriam

    In my experience Bell's Palse is caused by Gallbladder and Stomach problems
    and not by the Herpes virus. If the Gallbladder does not show anything
    anymore, which part of her digestive system has not cleared?

    If you suggest to treat with the Intestinal Flora, her digestive system
    still shows drops probably? Does she have constipation? If she does, treat
    with the Intestinal Flora or Carcinoma Coli if it is very resistant.
   
    Also if I have a client with Herpes (cold sores/shingles) I always treat
    with Variolinum. This gives far better results than the Herpes remedies. I
    never use the Herpes remedies anymore.

    Also if a remedy shows up each time in the measurements you have to try
    something else because obviously this one is not working. Even though you
    do measure it, it doesn't work to clear the disturbance.

    When the Intestines are really clean and the Gallbladder too, then see if
    the Liver shows. This might also clean up the Bell's Palse since the Liver
    is often an underlying cause of the Gallbladder disturbances.

    You may treat the vocal cords with Phosphor and perhaps Tonsillitis,
    Anginheel and Tonsilla Comp as support for the throat.

    Hello Johan, 

    You say "if a remedy shows up each time in the measurements you have to try
    something else because obviously this one is not working." 

    I wonder when we balance the points with infection remedies like
    Cholecystitis, Cystopyelonephritis, Zirrhose hepatis and such don't we need
    to use them for sometimes? 

    Or after few times ( two or three ?) using for example Zirrhose Hepatis I
    should try other liver remedies like Hepatitis.
    I wonder about the consistency of using the same remedies verses different
    remedies for balancing the same meridians in a row of treatments. 

    Thank you for your help in better understanding the process of healing.

    Hi Irina

    There are some problems that need time to heal. Those are normally the
    problems that have gone very chronic.

    In these cases the remedy might match a number of times, like Liver
    Cirrhosis, Gallstones, Fibroid Tumors in the Uterus

    The physical body needs time to break these things up / heal them. And
    until they are totally gone you will measure them.

    However with the Liver: It is more a quality. Liver cirrhosis can go to
    Hepatitis in one session. If one week you treat with Liver Cirrhosis, then
    next time you first try Hepatitis. Only if it does not match, you can try
    Cirrhosis again.

    However, if it is a condition like Vaccinations, Streptococcus or
    Staphylococcen, Food Poisoning Bacteria, Viruses or Heavy Metals that keep
    showing up, you should question whether
   
    a) There is a continuous (re)infection source
    b) There is something that holds it in place.

    Because it is normal that these things disappear in one treatment.

    This is where your detective skills come in.... Many possibilities. 

    But the message Johan gives here is that if a remedy like that doesn't work
    (shows up in the measurements every time), continue to look for something
    that does.

    An example is Strep and Staph that won't go away and then sometimes when
    you put in Chlamydia Pneumoniae all of a sudden the problem is gone.

    Thank you for answering my question. 

    In case of Cystopyelonephritis ( measured and balanced Kidney with it few
    times) what is likely the cause of inflammation? 

    Intestinal Flora, Food Poison, Staph, Strep... Is there any priority in
    this list in trying to balance Kidney?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    February 2013 Flag
    It depends on what you measure.... I would look at what other systems have
    problems. 

    Food Poisonings and Intestinal Flora are of course more likely to affect
    the Kidneys if the Intestinal climate is not good. Strep and Staph will be
    suspect if there's tonsillitis, strep/staph skin conditions or infections
    in lungs and heart. 

    Every client is like a puzzle and you have to consider all pieces to get
    the full picture. This way you'll get faster to the cause.

Explaining Spin Inversion Treatment

June 2015 edited June 2015 in Spin Inversion & Cause Flag
Question:
1. How should I explain to a client the way in which Spin Inversion treatment
works? 
2. Why is the blood is necessary?
3. What does the spiral coil and cup do with the information contained in the
blood that makes it possible to reverse the Spin Inversion condition?

    Answers:
    1. By putting the blood within the spiral we create information that will
    be accepted by the body and thus create the right information to correct
    the Spin Inversion
    2. We prefer to use the blood because it has a 100% resonance with the
    body's own fluids. 
    3. The cup has nothing to do with the treatment. It is the spiral that has
    the right direction of the spin of the electrons.

    Thank you Johan. Hate to pry but if you were explaining this to someone who
    had a thorough understanding of Physics would you recommend that I word my
    response a little differently? This just seems to be the part of the
    treatment that leads to the most questions, so I want to be well versed at
    explaining it. 
   
    I am just looking for a way to address this question that doesn't lead to
    more questions.  For instance is the polarity of the spiral spinning the
    energetic imprint of the blood ?  In that regard does the energetic imprint
    of the blood spinning in the correct direction then "piggy back" on the
    bodies light waves traveling through the Chiren similarly to the way the
    remedies do?

    I generally compare the whole situation with the solar system, whereby the
    planets turn around the sun but also turn around their axis.

    If a magnetic field is strong enough, it can turn the earth in the opposite
    direction. So the earth still turns around the sun, but turns the opposite
    way around its axis.

    The same can happen to the nucleus and electrons of the body, although I
    get the idea that it is mainly the nucleus and electrons of the water
    molecules.

    In treatment the information of the blood spinning in the right direction
    then is modulated on top of the light waves of the body and thereby
    re-informs the body.

    been totally cured after only 4 treatments. I assume that is the type of
    information they want.

    Yes, that sounds great! If you can tell that story with all the details
    about diagnosis and how things shifted during the treatment, or maybe even
    invite you client to share a little bit of her experience too, it would be
    very interesting.

    I will. My client has been waiting for the website to change and not
    require all the personal information before sending in her statement, or at
    least a reassurance that her personal email won't be published or shown.
     Any chance that this will happen soon as we had discussed?

    You can reassure her that no personal e-mail will be published. If you want
    you can send me just the testimonial, so even I don't know who she is. She
    can just give her initials and state she lives in for example, or whatever
    she does want to share....

    If you can write in a couple of sentences exactly how you want things to be
    expressed with the testimonial form on the website, I can add these.

    Thanks. She does not mind using her name. In fact she has told me that if
    people have doubts about the treatment that they can call her. It is the
    email being visible to others that is an issue so I will relate what you
    have posted here.

    That would be great for the biontology website too.... I'd like to have an

    anyone who has some miracles to share, please send them to me. 

    The client doesn't have to be on there with full name and address, but if
    he/she doesn't mind to share these that is all the better for credibility.

    Hi Dennis,

    The woman you're describing has suffered a lot of trauma and stress in her
    life, causing a continuous over-activation of her sympathetic nervous
    system (fight or flight response). The organ systems that are most affected
    by this are Adrenals and Gallbladder/Liver.

    All symptoms she has fit this picture. So this makes clear what focus your
    treatment should have:

    Gallbladder/Liver => Muscle spasms in hips legs and toes, high blood sugar,
    high cholesterol
    Adrenals => High Cortisol (also causes high blood sugar)
    Liver => MS

    When things don't show up in your measurement that are very clearly
    reflected in the picture of symptoms, it can be caused by suppression or
    other measurement problems.

    I also like to emphasize that the supports you mainly need are Compositae
    and Homaccords and that Bush and Bach can be of assistance in emotional
    symptoms relief (which can be helpful of course), but that one or two
    flower remedies, that she has the most resonance with, is enough. More is
    not better, it will direct the energy in too many directions and might even
    not have an added effect at all.

    Answers:
    If you want to treat the physical internal scars because of demyelination
    you could do that along the column and it might even help, so of course you
    can try to do this. However it remains on the level of symptom treatment
    (the internal cause of the demyelination is not addressed) and at the same
    time it is very time consuming. You will have to run the full one and a
    half minutes of the Scar Program many times, since with physical scars you
    can only have a maximum of 7cm between the rods. If you want to reach
    internal scars don't forget to put Procranium in a slot when you run the
    Scar Program or as part of the Standard Hand treatment.

    Another problem is that the demyelination is not only taking place in the
    spinal cord, but also in the brain... 

    So the most effective way to treat is to focus on Nosodes and the assisting
    Supports (e.g. Nosodes for Gallbladder + Support for Gallbladder). When the
    Liver starts to show drops (the Liver usually doesn't show itself from the
    start when it is under severe stress) you're on the right track. 
   
    When the internal cause of the MS is addressed, then whatever still can be
    repaired will be repaired (don't forget in prolonged degenerative diseases
    there is also damage that can't be reversed...)
    When the Gallbladder and Liver are functioning like they should again,
    cholesterol will automatically be balanced. High cholesterol is not a cause
    of disease, it is a symptom showing an imbalance. 
   
    When a healthy person eats a lot of cholesterol containing foods his
    cholesterol won't rise, the Liver regulates cholesterol levels and expels
    excess with bile and generates extra cholesterol when there's need for it.
   
    I hope this answers your questions.

    I tried treating the entire spine, 7 cm at a time, with scar treatment.
    During treatment,client said she could feel movement in her cells,
    described as a bandage being pulled off of a cut. After treatment, she
    stood very straight, appeared taller, lifted her hands into the air and
    said she felt great -better than she has felt in years. 

    I have continued to treat her weekly with the scar treatment along the
    spine along with standard rod and footplates and now approaching session #
    16
    She reports that she is feeling better.though still not walking without a
    cane most of the time.

    Last session 

    Scar Treatment:
    Procranium  
    Nervoheel 

    1st Measurement:
    Large Intestine (point 2&3)
    Circulation - 4 points

    >12 yrs Program:
    Barijodeel
    Botulism
    Brucellosis

    2nd measurement:
    Nervous System (R) - all points
    Veins (L) - 3 points

    Foot Plates:
    Mellilotus, Barijodeel, Rubella, Schwefheel, Psorinum, Varicellen, 
    Variolinum, Old man Banksia

    Questions:
    1. What is the likelihood that she will be able to walk normally again.

    2. How should I focus my treatments to address the Multiple Sclerosis?
    I have run Rubella whenever it has measured on the Nervous System.

    Answers:
    1. As long as there' s improvement, just continue your treatment. You can
    never know the limitations and capabilities of the body to Self Heal.     
    Do the legs have the same length, since this can affect the ability to walk
    normal too?
    Did you treat Liver/Gallbladder? You have given me only a few treatment's
    details...

    2. MS (diagnosis!) is an indication of a combination of Symptoms, which
    could be caused by various things.You should not focus on the MS, but
    assess the condition of your client objectively. What symptoms are still
    there?

    Dennis: Did you put Procranium and Nervoheel in slots to run during Scar
    Programs or you ran remedies in 12 yrs Program?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    January 2014 edited January 2014 Flag
    Yelyena: It is important to understand that this does not make any
    difference. Every Informational Remedy you offer to the System will reach
    every location in the body, no matter what Program you use. There's no
    separation in our Informational/Light body.
    The different Programs have different ways of harmonising Biophoton
    emission, but as far as the Informational Remedies are concerned, bringing
    the body into contact with them is enough, and this happens in all Programs
    (as long as you run it from beginning to end)
    Choosing to put Remedies in the Scar Treatment however has consequences for
    the number of Remedies you use in total, and this is why I discourage it.
    You can just use Nervoheel and Procranium in the Hand Treatment if you
    think you need those and then locally run the Scar Treatment.

    When there's a situation that is not a usual Session, like the need of
    local Symptom Treatment, you can use Remedies in the Scar Treatment. This
    would, for example, make sense when you give someone a Chikey for home
    treatment of Symptoms. Then you could create a card with Procranium and
    Nervoheel… But I would prefer Cerebrum over Nervoheel in this particular
    situation. Nervoheel is a remedy for psychosomatic disorders, and not so
    much for nerve healing. Cerebrum is a remedy that helps with the physical
    repair of affected Nerves.

    Questions

    1. Please share some successful cases, outcomes and maybe statistics of
    people who were successfully treated with MS.
    My client is not seeing enough improvement and I like to give her some hope
    (she's getting frustrated).

    2. Is it necessary to remove Mercury fillings that are Porcelain crowned? 
    I know that finances are an issue for her and would only recommend doing
    this if you feel it is necessary.

    3. Any other comments/suggestions as to how to proceed would be appreciated

    4. My client sent this this article about foodbourne toxin Clostridium
    Perfringens, relationship to MS   Article Link  Is there a nosode present
    in the Chiren that tests for Clostridium Perfringens?

    Hi Dennis,

    My MS/Lyme positive client isn't getting much of a response either, so I
    appreciate your questions. I'll be looking for any comments that might
    appear.

    My guess is re: Clostridium perfringen question, that Karolina will say to
    focus on intestinal flora. Or, that there maybe other nosodes that would
    resonant with this specific bug that could do the same work.

    Answers:
    1. Results depend on your ability to focus on causes and guide the body
    through the process in the right order. I have seen many successful cases
    in my life.

    The true MS cases I have seen in my practice all responded very quickly to
    Rubella (measured on the Nervous System)
    But when the symptoms are caused by the Liver (controls the strength of the
    muscles) it takes some time. The Liver needs to be treated when at least
    all the Yang organs are in order. Before it is time to treat the Liver
    other symptoms will improve but not the typical MS symptoms.

    But you focus too much on the diagnosis, as I mentioned before.
    Stiffness in the muscles is NOT a symptom of MS, so I wonder if she has MS.

    Both Stiffness and Cysts are a consequence of malfunctioning Circulation
    (could be caused by Adrenal exhaustion, Gallbladder, Circulation). The
    muscles possibly do not get sufficient blood.

    The Veins need to be addressed. In your measurement there are still 2
    points dropping.
    When you find calcification (Barijodeel), you never know how much there is
    and the remedy is often needed for quite a number of treatments. If it does
    not match anymore for two consecutive sessions, you may assume that all
    calcification is gone.
    Hamammelis and Mellilotis are for the strength of the valves in the veins.
    There is no use in using Hamamelis if Aurumheel or Barijodeel still match.

    Gallbladder: treat with Biliary Cirrhosis instead of Cholecystitis first.
    With her history of Gallbladder symptoms and the severity of them, it is
    far more likely this is the remedy you need.

    Adrenals: Because her history shows continuous stress, Adrenal exhaustion
    and Gallbladder malfunctioning, and the resulting Circulation issues are to
    be expected.
    You must address the need for a change in lifestyle.
    Most people spend more energy than they have => they spend energy that the
    body needs to heal => they never get over their exhausted Adrenals => their
    Circulation will never recover.
    If you don't get rid of the Cause, there will be no healing.

    2. Amalgam fillings are generally pretty stable (full mercury fillings
    don't exist) unless there are conditions that cause leakage. Fillings start
    leaking if there are strong electrical currents flowing between the
    fillings.
    But then you should find extensive Mercury or Lead in various systems of
    the body.
    But again, these toxins could also come from other sources.
    My experience is that people get far more problems by the removal of the
    fillings.
    I don't know about crowns on top of amalgam.... I have never heard that. As
    far as I know crowns are normally put on top of an Aluminum cap. But my
    knowledge might be limited.

    3. I see that Large Intestine (R) plus Large Intestine (L) drops on 7
    points. There is only one conclusion and that is Appendicitis Necroticans
    or Chronic Appendicitis. This is not addressed.

    I see that you use Strep and Staph, probably for the Heart, but the Heart
    is a YIN organ which should be addressed when the YANG organs are all
    functioning well.

    So the best advise is to follow the protocol and focus

    4. There is no nosode with which you can test for this bug, but don't
    concentrate on the specific bug. See what nosodes correct the Intestinal
    drops. Appendicitis Necroticans would be the first suggestion...

    Hello Johan,
    Thank you so much for your in depth reply.

    I have measured Rubella on her Nervous system several times and have
    treated with it so I am unclear why this didn't bring about a successful
    result.

    My guess is that since this has been going on for a very long time, even if
    it was MS, other parts of her body have been compromised and that she may
    have embodied the symptoms, crippled walk, nervous twitching, etc. as a way
    of coping with too much stress. 

    I will follow your advice and keep you posted.

    * When you measure Rubella Several times this indicates that Rubella is
    fixed somehow… In normal conditions it would disappear from the Nervous
    System within one or two sessions.

    * You also need to distinguish between Cause and Result. 
    - Rubella is the Cause of MS and not the Result or Consequence….
    - Degeneration of the Myelin Sheaths (=why the muscles don't get the right
    instructions) is the Result of Rubella
    - When the Myelin Sheaths have been generated for a long time this might be
    the Cause of Muscles degeneration/atrophy (=Result)….  

    * When you correct a Cause, then everything that was damaged in the body
    because of it (=Result) still has to be dealt with. 
   
    * Physical healing goes much slower than energetic healing, and the Myelin
    Sheaths might not have had sufficient time. It might take a long time for
    the body to heal the physical Nerves. So for the Muscles to heal, since
    this issue is secondary to the Nerve degeneration, might even take longer. 
   
    * Some damage might prove to be irreversible too. This is something you
    can't predict
   
    * But in any case you need to get the Circulation up and going, 
    regeneration of the physical body is very much dependent on the
    circulation.

    * Another possible reason for lack of improvement is that the Physical Body
    not takes the instruction from the Energetic Body. For this you can try
     Schwefheel and Psorinum a number of times if you haven't tried this
    already.
   
    * I would also investigate the length of her legs. Do both legs have the
    same length??

June 2015 - Suppression

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
June 2015 in Q&A Flag
Practitioner:
Could you share your insights and understanding of what “suppression” in the
human body is… so we as new practitioners can better interpret it to our
clients when they want information and understanding, as well as, for our own
understanding ...

Questions
A. Do you make a distinction between emotional, energetic, structural and
physical suppression, or does the interrelatedness make them equal?

B. Could you explain how suppression affects different organ systems, and how
to determine when one organ system is stressed and affects other systems? This
seems especially relevant if the suppressed organ doesn’t show drops, as I
believe you have mentioned happens to the Gallbladder at times…

C. Can you explain how healing of one "system/layer" will then allow another
system to expose its stressors?

D. Is this also related to what you mean when you say "let it come to you--
don't hunt for it"? Would you please explain this in theory and in example....
thank you very much!

Answers
A. The body in all its facets can decide for one reason or anther to not
express its malfunctions in symptoms or one decides that one does not want to
deal with it.
Taking an aspirin for pain, is suppressing the cause of the pain. Taking
antibiotics or cortisone for an infection is suppressing. The production of
endorphins is also a sign that the body has to deal with a certain kind of
stress and that it cannot. That is when the body decides to produce endorphins
and nothing is felt. But underneath this layer this problem continues to
develop and is getting worse. In other words the problem is not solved.
If one has experienced a certain trauma in his or her life, you might not be
able to deal with it in a correct way but one still has to continue with his or
her life. This trauma then is put away and is suppressed. Until at one time a
problem surfaces that has the same origin as the original trauma, although it
might seem very different and unrelated. Or it might come back in a similar
fashion.
In short suppression makes people not feel the problems, although they are
there. But then later, the problem might express itself and it does not mean
that the cause is detected because the problem has developed itself.
Any non-expressed problem is a toxin to the body, this is also true for
emotional problems. Such a toxin or an accumulation of such toxins can lead to
serious physical problems. Only because they are not expressed, not thrown out
of the body. Toxins will in most people be stored in the Liver but at the
moment might also be stored n the fatty tissue, which will lead to obesity.
When they are stored in the Liver, one will develop Liver Cirrhosis.

B. Basically all forms of suppression are the same. But the habit in one system
will lead to a similar process in other systems. It is contagious within one
person because all systems are interconnected.
The systems can also ignore the problems because they do not recognize the
problem as a problem, or in other words they do not discriminate. This is the
greatest problem in humanity: people simply do not see it, but only find out
later in life.
These problems can and will appear in the mental body, the physical body and in
the emotional body. They cannot be separated. 

C. A problem can be hidden behind any other layer. If, for example, one has
Appendicitis and the body decides to not deal with the problem, then the
problem spreads within the physical body and within the energetic body. At the
same time the Appendicitis also becomes worse and deteriorates into a chronic
and necrotizing condition.
In the physical body the Appendicitis will first move from the Appendix into
the rest of the Large Intestine, then into Small Intestine. This then leads to
problems with the Intestinal Flora. These Bacteria then cause infections
elsewhere and Kidney/Bladder problems develop. If the problem continues then
the Liver/Gallbladder get involved. This might create infections in those
organs like Hepatitis or Cholecystitis.
And this happens only because the body is suppressing or does not recognize the
problem. This lack of recognition is in my opinion due to certain malfunctions
of the Pituitary gland.
If one layer covers another layer, this layer cannot be seen anymore and the
stress of the body increases.
The main reason for suppression is stress and overwhelm in a general form. It
includes stress in all bodies and by all causes. 
One might have a bacterial infection and one has no symptoms. But in some cases
one sees it in the measurement. Then it is treated and suddenly cold symptoms
appear.
People then think the cold might be recently acquired. But the bacterial
infection has been there all the time. Relaxation is the name of the game. The
Chiren is an instrument that has the capability of relaxing the body, allowing
the body to free up energy and finally attend to healing these suppressed
issues. Therefore symptoms might appear out of nothing. But the problems were
there all the time but suppressed. These are caused by a functioning immune
system. One cannot successfully overcome a cold without having a runny nose.
The white blood cells that died in battle have to go somewhere…

But not all symptoms that appear after treatment are caused by suppression that
is lifted. All symptoms that you would normally expect from a working immune
system are OK. For example, mild flu-like symptoms for the first three days
after treatment are normal, but there are also symptoms that are caused by
overburdening of the body by giving too many treatments and using too many
nosodes or treating in the wrong sequence. Such symptoms include: extreme
exhaustion that lasts more than two or three days after treatment, pain in the
Kidney area, extreme blood pressure spikes, hemorrhages, hypersensitivity,
herpes outbreaks..

D. If I say: " don't chase what you want, but wait for it to come ", this has
nothing to do with suppression. Most things that we want are not meant for us
or we might want things at the wrong time.
If we send out our wishes into the universe and forget about them, our wishes
might be fulfilled at some time, perhaps not.
If they are not meant for us, we will not get them. If they appear later, the
time is right. But one needs to forget about them. If one continues to think
about them, the thinking interferes with the processes and one might never
receive them, even when they are good.
If a hunter wants to get some game, he does not start running to find the game.
This will chase the animals away. He should sit and wait. When game does
appear, he should quietly take his weapon and shoot the rabbit or deer. But one
thing that is crucial in this process is that one observes very well.
If one observes, one can see and hear all kind of signs that indicate what is
happening. Movements of birds, rustling of the leaves, a branch cracking… Only
by quiet observation, one can take action at the appropriate time and no energy
is wasted.

Bone Graphs - Can I Treat?

Barbaralee
November 2013 edited January 2014 in Contraindications Flag
A potential client had bone from a donor graphed on to her own knee bone. 

Question:
I understand that with transplanted organs etc., we can not treat.
What about bone?

    Clients with cadaver bone transplants can be treated, since the body won't
    create an immune response to it.

    Hi Karolina,

    I am wondering about this since I believe cadaver bone recipients usually
    receive immunosuppressants for a while to make sure they don't have graft
    vs host rejection. Just wondering if it might be
    Safer to wait a few months to treat after implantation, so we don't create
    an immune response rejection.

    However perhaps after all the people we have done collectively as a group,
    maybe this has never happened and we don't need to wait. It's just a line
    of thinking as my client was on immunosuppressants after his cadaver bone
    implant.

    Thanks,
    Jan

    Hi Jan,

    Cadaver bone grafts are frequently used without immunosuppresants.  This is
    often done in preparation for a dental implant after a bone abscess has
    created a void.

    I always email an intake form before the initial appointment with a list of
    questions including:  "Are you on Immunosuppresants?" At the bottom it says
    to contact me prior to the appointment if they answer "yes" to any of the
    questions.  I won't treat someone on immunosuppresants.

    My policy has been to wait for a year after a bone graft.  Although I've
    not thought of the possibility of a cadaver graft giving less of an immune
    response. - (If I read Karolina's response correctly)

    immunosuppressants I would not treat either.

    I appreciate the clarification, particularly with regard to dental grafts. 
    I have treated several people with cadaver bones in for a while,over a
    year, no problem. But if they are new, I have waited 6 months and no
    problem with the two new ones. One a knee, and one a leg bone (both on
    immunosuppressents briefly). Both client's doctors felt the risk of host/
    graft rejection had passed.

     I agree with you both.   I do think we all need to be very careful and
    thoughtful about treating at all with immunosuppressents, sometimes clients
    will really push for this. One must consider what it is that may surface 
    that has been suppressed and how severely it may affect the client.
    Particularly those with HIV+ and multiple co-infections. Tricky, and
    perhaps dangerous…because they have to express it to treat it.  As a
    general 99% rule, I don't treat, if they are on them.   
   
    The exception I believe is when the client feels there is a mis diagnosis.
    For instance in an auto immune illness and they are on an immunosuppressent
    and they feel there is another cause rather than an overactive immune
    system they need to suppress. The only way you can get to the cause is to
    lift the suppression and see what is going on.

    This practice of using cadaver bones is a relatively recent phenomenon, and
    we don't have the long term experience with it. Encapsulation often takes
    years…...

    But if the bone is fixed (with pins) it will at least stay in location.
    When it is not it might be a problem when the body wants to get rid of it.

Inflammation vs Infection

Renate
January 2013 edited January 2014 in Definitions Flag
In the webnars I have noticed that the words Inflammation and Infection are
being used interchangeably. I believe Sophie said that a word ending in “itis”
indicates an Infection. 

In the U.S. we used words ending in “itis” for conditions involving
Inflammation which may, or may not, have a Bacterial or Viral component
involved. For instance Interstitial Cystitis of the Bladder means that the
Bladder is irritated but does not necessarily mean there is a Bacterial
Infection causing the irritation (it could be the results of Toxins or Metals,
etc). 

 My father who is Austrian said that his doctor uses the words interchangeably
which creates confusion when I communicate with him regarding his health
issues. I’m wondering if there is a language barrier and if there is a way that
we can be more clear in the Chiren classes?

    Thanks Renate, you're completely right.
    All diseases ending with -itis are indicating an inflammation, either
    sterile or non-sterile (non-bacterial cause or bacterial cause). This is
    universal medical language and not a matter of cultural differences. Some
    people, including doctors, are just not as precise with language...

Forgetting to Remove Spin Inversion Cup

    In the Whiplash/Scar treatment the biophoton resonance filter is
    functional, so every energy/information that would be unhealthy and is
    brought into contact with the body will be filtered out immediately. 

    So unless the blood from the other person would do something positive to
    this person you treated for Whiplash, the blood will not do anything.

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    March 2015 edited March 2015 Flag
    After you have effectively ran Spin Inversion, you should disconnect the
    cup during measurement. Then you can reconnect it again and continue to
    treat with the blood during the hand treatment, disconnect it again during
    the measurement and connect it again during the footplate treatment. This
    is all within the boundaries of the protocol and you have the added benefit
    of treatment with own blood.

    The above question about not removing the cup, however, was about treating
    accidentally with someone else's blood because of forgetting to remove the
    blood from a previous client.

    Ones own blood (inside the spiral) is an extra remedy for detoxification.
    Treatments with own blood have shown to be very good for Heart, Circulation
    and Liver.

    Because the treatment cycles are having a detoxifying effect anyway there
    is no danger if you run the blood with it during your normal (weekly)
    session, but I normally do not do this because the detox effects are high
    anyway even without the blood. 
    I am not in the habit of adding things to the treatment that are not
    necessary, so I only take a drop of blood when it is essential (Spin
    Inversion).

3. What would cause Vertigo/Menieres disease and crystals in the ear? Would
this cause her occasional hearing loss?

4. Im also guessing her eye is permanently damaged from the exposure to toxins
in art school?


Your help is much appreciated-thank you!

    Hi Colby, I tried to get an oversight of what was done, but I am not really
    clear about on which points in your session you measured and treated and
    what was the outcome...  
    Can you arrange things more chronologically? 
    Did you measure after the >12 yrs treatment? What points were dropping? You
    only mention the final measurement...
    Now things look somewhat confusing, and it is not really clear if you for
    example treated scar before the measurements that you wrote down or
    after...

    I did the scar treatment before Whiplash and Spin Inversion treatment the
    first session. I did check points after the full session and they were for
    the most part stable. I don't have notes on the measurements in between.

    Both sessions were focused on the Hormone System because both times the
    Pituitary, Parathyroid, Pineal and Thyroid were dropping. The Thyroid was
    fixed after the Whiplash treatment the first time.

    The measurement after the 1st hand treatment is what is really important,
    this is when you observe the effect of the treatment with measured nosodes.
    Usually all points/meridians of focus should have been corrected after the
    hand treatment.

    Support remedies can also temporarily correct drops that where still there,
    but they won't address a problem deep enough to correct the drop
    permanently. So in a way they can mask problems that were still there. This
    is why it is very important information to know what was measured 
    immediately after the hand treatment.

    General Feedback
    1. Where is the Poliomyelitis nosode in the treatment? This one is the most
    essential.
    2. I am very surprised that the Large Intestine is not showing
    3. In the first treatment you used Toxins and a Heavy Metal. This is
    totally prohibited! (study the protocol)
    4. In the second treatment you use 3 different nosodes to clear only ONE
    point. How is this possible?
    5. In the first session there were no Kidney points dropping, in the second
    session there were suddenly a few drops on the Kidney meridian. This means
    that Kidney was measured wrongly the first time and important corrective
    action needs to be taken in the 2nd session. This was omitted. In the
    second session all Bacterial Flora + ALL Kidney support remedies need to be
    applied.
    6. although she has had an appendectomy there should still be Appendicitis
    in the rest of the Large Intestine and Small Intestine measurable. 
    I suggest that you treat with all three of the Appendicitis nosodes, when
    Hormonal System and Kidneys are clean.

    Answers
    2. It is very likely that there is a Circulation issue because the brain
    tumours are likely to originate from cysts.
    But you need to address the cause of the cysts first which in this case is
    likely the Gallbladder. There are various symptoms that indicate this:
    Anxiety, Menieres.

    3. Menieres is a typical Gallbladder issue. The vertigo might have
    something to do with this too but could also be caused by problems in the
    middle ear, like blocked Lymphatic vessels or problems with her equilibrium
    system which is also situated within the ears. But also the blocked
    Lymphatic issues could be caused by the Gallbladder system

    4. That could be the case but it is equally possible that her eye problem
    is caused by internal pressure (Gallbladder) or by her Stomach/Small
    Intestine problems

    Response to Comments
    1. She did not have a Polio vaccination. It also did not correct the
    Pituitary point, should I have put this nosode in anyway? 

    2. I was surprised in general that I didn't measure drops on many of the
    meridians... Could the medication be masking drops, even though the Hormone
    System did have severe drops?
    She agreed to 4 more sessions, so I will pay extra attention to measuring
    the Large Intestine.

    3. Even though Platinum is a Heavy Metal, and normally you would't treat
    for that until the layer of the Nervous System has focus, it is listed in
    the Measurement Protocol as a nosode to use for the Pituitary, Pineal and
    Thyroid. Should Heavy Metals never been used in the first session ever?

    4. I was having hard time in the 2nd session correcting the Pituitary. It
    seemed that sometimes a combo of nosodes worked rather than one. I believe
    I tried Poliomyelitis but it did not help and since she had not gotten the
    vaccination I didn't put it in.

    5. Ok- so in the third session I should make sure that I put all Bacterial
    Flora and Kidney supports in? After making sure the Hormone system is
    clear?

    6. I will treat all 3 Appendicitis nosodes after Hormonal System and
    Kidneys are clear

    1. Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus should always be put in, irrespective of
    them matching or not. 

    2. Any organ that is under stress can produce endorphins, but the Large
    Intestine is a Yang Organ and these hardly ever suppress in my experience,
    unless there is a complete endorphin mask, which suppresses everything. Yin
    Organs would normally be the first to suppress. When the Large Intestine 
    does suppress, it means that it is severely affected. I do observe,
    however, that you are still learning how to measure. 

    (Internal) scars may also block the readings. Did you treat the scars?
    Otherwise it might be a good idea to apply scar therapy on the abdomen. 

    Appendicitis is not restricted to the Appendix but can cause inflammation
    all over the Small and Large Intestine. 

    3. Platinum is a Heavy Metal and should indeed never be used before the
    Yang organs are clean. Plus the fact that you should only use one remedy on
    a point, not three. You should always measure for one remedy that matches. 
    The fact that multiple remedies are mentioned under the Pituitary gland in
    the Measurement Protocol does not mean you have to put in all. You need to
    measure them one by one. Only the one remedy that matches is then used in
    treatment. Although Platinum matches, you should still look for another
    remedy. A combo is not good.

    Your struggle to get the Pituitary right (both sessions) is not uncommon
    for new students, who are still practicing their measurement skills, and
    this likely is more a measurement issue than anything else. The proximal
    points are often experienced as difficult to measure.

    4. The Poliomyelitis nosode is made of the polio virus and can be used both
    for the vaccination effects and for the actual disease. Being around
    vaccinated kids may also expose a person to the virus. Also, some people do
    not know or remember what vaccinations they had. 

    5. Yes, the Hormone System should be clear. But don't use Toxins or Heavy
    Metals.

    6. Remember, that this is advice because the Intestines do not give a
    reliable indication. Normally you should measure what is necessary.

I have a 5 year old boy I am hoping to treat that has recently been found to be

If he will not let me measure his points, could I have his mother hold him and
measure through her? 
Also, do you have any suggestions on where to start? I am not sure if he was
vaccinated.

    Epileptic seizures are Gallbladder related.

    Be sure to check for Whiplash too. This gives problems in the whole
    Digestive System.

    Since nobody is 100% clean, even after a treatment of the mother the energy
    of the mother and the child will be mixed in a way that doesn't allow a
    completely reliable measurement anymore. For this reason it is always best
    to measure the child. I have never experienced a child that has problems
    with this. But you should be able to measure quickly and correctly, then
    the child won't have a problem.

    However if you really want to surrogate measure you should first clean the
    mother completely by treating her and then measure her with a picture of
    the child on the footplate connected to the Cup-Port. Not with the whole
    interaction between mother and child going on when the child sits in
    mothers lap. Mothers often project many things on their children and they
    are completely open to their mothers energy. Treating the mother beforehand
    wouldn't take that dynamic away...
   
    I never surrogate measure, but treat according to the symptoms. The same
    with animals.

    If you want to experiment with remedies, please do it outside of this

    I've been treating a client who was seizuring several times a day and even
    during the first treatment went into one. Working on the Gallbladder was
    enough (Circulation is a big problem of her too). 
    She was seizure free for some time, but unfortunately I can't offer a lot
    of continuity because of waiting lists and travelling. Now she's
    controlling her seizures with a test model Chikey and just Atropinum on the
    card...

    If the child has stomach problems, please take a good look at the food
    poisoning area. I had treated a boy that had suddenly epileptic seasures,
    he was 4 years old. that was because he could not handle the fruit Apple!
     
    So they stopped giving him apple and the problem was gone, then when
    everything is calm ( especialy the Gallbladder ) you can treat why he is
    allergic to apple. Check everything on the Intestines and Stomach.

    EMF exposure can also increase incidence of epilepsy.

    Epileptic attacks are always Gallbladder problems. Gallbladder problems are
    stress related. Anything that causes stress can trigger the symptoms. 
    In the case of allergy to seeded fruits, they very often create Gallbladder
    problems. I have seen people with allergies for these, react with all kinds
    of Gallbladder symptoms. 

    EMF exposure can also do this.
    Treating EMF can temporarily solve a symptom, but it will always come back.
    ALWAYS try to find the cause and do not just treat the symptom, even though
    the symptom might have gone, the underlying cause is still there

    When there's an apple allergy, this causes stress and influences the
    Gallbladder negatively. 
    (If it is not an apple allergy it might also be the pesticides in/on the
    apple that causes the bad reaction.... ???)

    Symptoms:
    Epileptic Seizures, Tics
    Autism, Extremely High Energy, Oppositional (most of the time, especially
    in social situations), best behaviour when he has a fever.
    Digestive Problems
    Poor Sleep

    History:
    Symptoms started from 2 weeks old
    Colic and Food Sensitivities => wheat, dairy, artificial colors and
    flavours were removed from diet
    Vaccinated as baby, but series were not finished (mother stopped them after
    symptoms began)

    1st Session 5/16/13

    Measurement:
    Pituitary,
    Parathyroid
    Small Intestines (L- 4 end points)
    Heart (R - 2nd point from palm
    Large Intestines - Appendix

    No drops on feet

    Treatment:
    Whiplash - cleared all but Small Intestines and Appendix

    2-7 yrs Program:
    Appendicitis - these 4 cleared the rest of the points
    Tonsillitis, Anginheel, Tonsilla Comp

    Results:
    After this treatment, he did amazingly well for two days.
    Slept better, less behavioral problems, teacher commented on how well he
    did.
    Then he reverted back to previous behavior.


    2nd Session 5/21/13

    Measurement:
    Parathyroid,
    Thymus (L),
    Insulin,
    Adrenals
    Small Intestines (L - 3 end points)

    Treatment:
    Whiplash - Balanced Triple Warmer

    2-7 yrs Program: 
    Appendicitis, Tonsillitis, Tonsilla Comp, Anginheel, Tonsillarproepfe 
   
    Another short Treatment because the Thymus still was dropping:
    Selenium and Berberis
   
    Results:
    He had no noticeable difference after this treatment.


    3rd Session 5/28/13 
   
    Measurement:
    Appendix 
    Stomach (L - end point) 
    Gallbladder (L - end point)

    Appendicitis, Adenomyose Gallenblase, Biliary Cirrhosis, Anginheel,
    Tonsillarproepfe 
   
    Results:
    He had no obvious effects from the treatments this time either.
   
   
    4th Session 6/6/13 - 
   
    Measurement:
    Small Intestines (R - end point) 
    Spleen (end point) 
    Gallbladder (L - end point) 
    Gallbladder (R - end point) 
   
    2-7 yrs Program:  
    Adenomyose Gallenblase, Biliary Cirrhosis, Ulcus Duodeni, Ulcus Ventriculi,
    Brucellosis, Cuprum, Aluminum
   
    After treating with these to clear points, the Appendix showed up. 
    2-7 yrs Program:  (these were needed for the Appendix) 
    Appendicitis, Mercuriusheel, Anginheel, Tonsillarproepfe, Tonsilla Comp,
    Tonsillitis 
   
    The Appendix still kept dropping, so did another short treatment with
    Mercury to finally clear. 
    <2 yrs Program: 
    Mercury - clearing Appendix 
   
    Results: 
    After this treatment, he appears to be having more seizures, so I have
    moved up his next appointment to the 11th, so he is only waiting 5 days
    between.

    Hi Sharon,
    There are several things I notice...

    1. The problems started after immunisation, but I don't see any vaccination
    in your treatments.... At least treat for Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus.
    Or if it was another vaccination the child received, treat this...

    2. You don't measure the Thyroid dropping anywhere and still you treat for
    Whiplash... In Whiplash the Thyroid is always dropping since there's a
    disturbance in the energetics of the whole neck area, which includes both
    Thyroid and Para-Thyroid.

    3. Seizures, Tics, Hyperactivity and Rebellion all have to do with the
    Gallbladder, but what is causing the Gallbladder distress...? It is likely
    that the Gallbladder can't heal because there's a cause that is not
    addressed yet. I would think the Vaccinations?

    4. Also the Gallbladder needs some support! I see you hardly use any
    Support Remedy... Especially Atropinum (relaxing!) and Chelidonium would be
    ones I would use here.

    5. In the last session you need many remedies to correct one point
    (Appendix) and then still it is not the right combination since it
    continues to drop after the treatment. I would always try to look for as
    little remedies as possible... 
    Did you try Tuberculinum? This remedy has indications for both Seizures and
    Hyperactivity. I also sometimes find Diphterinum to match on the
    Appendix... (own observation, not Johan's)

    6. If you choose to do less days in between instead of more (this would
    give the body more time to settle after the treatment) I would use less
    Nosodes and more Support...

    I hope this helps and am looking forward to your follow up.

    1. I checked vaccinations on the Triple Warmer on the first treatment and
    didn't find them to clear these. Do I put in Vaccinations anyway, or only
    if they clear a point?

    2. I am glad to know you have to have both for Whiplash. So why did
    Whiplash clear points if it wasn't indicated? Is it possible for more than
    one remedy to clear the same point?

    3. Helpful insight here. Can I find Vaccinations on the Gallbladder?

    4. Will do!!

    5. Yes, not my best session... We had the child put the gold rod in his
    mouth, between his toes, etc. in order to work with him... :) I will try
    Tuberculinum and Diphterinum.

    6. So it is better to have longer between treatments for recovery time even
    if he is having more seizures?...

    I will report back after his treatment tomorrow. Thanks for the help.

    1. You also have to go by observation. If you measure something that
    doesn't make sense.... like in this case: symptoms that started with
    vaccinations and then the vaccinations don't show..... then there is an
    inconsistency and you should treat the vaccinations anyway. Poliomyelitis
    and Anti Tetanus always show the first Session.

    2. Sometimes you can balance a point without addressing the true cause by
    just running the Light (like in Whiplash Treatment). This way you are
    masking the problem though, which in the case of the Para-Thyroid is the
    Anti-Tetanus vaccination. The prove of this is shown by the fact that in
    the second treatment the Para-Thyroid again is dropping. Most likely you
    overlooked the -slight- drop on the Para-Thyroid in session 3 and 4. 

    3. Because usually you'll find the Vaccination in the first steps of your
    assessment, when you're trying to balance the hormonal system, usually you
    won't need to measure them anywhere else. But yes, since the vaccinations
    are big stressors, you might find them there.... 

    6. It all depends, but usually when you have done a complete session that
    created a heavy response, giving even more impulses will only make it
    harder on the body. Unless it is just a little support where not enough
    support was given...
    Don't forget that the Biophoton Treatment is not doing the work.... the
    body is! The temptation is to try and solve reactions that were caused by
    over treating by treating even more. But this makes no sense.

    Your last treatment had 3 heavy metals in there, that's a lot considering
    that the Hormonal System most likely is not yet balanced (vaccinations were
    not treated) and also since you didn't support the Kidneys for all that
    anticipated detox.... Too heavy detox causes Stress => Liver/Gallbladder =>
    Seizures

    This is so helpful. The Whiplash did make sense also, because he had a
    forcep birth. So it was not completely clear to me. I am so grateful to
    have more direction today and will respond again.

    Then there definitely was a Whiplash... I don't think a baby can go through
    a forceps delivery without getting this problem.
    When a Whiplash is treated however it is rarely needed a second time
    without something happening (e.g. falling) in between sessions.

    5th Session 6/11/13 

    Situation after last session:
    Boy went to sleep by himself all week (a first, so parents were thrilled). 
    Mother told vaccinations were given first when 2 months old (that she knows
    of - sometimes hospital staff acts independent of parental wishes) and the
    colic started at 2 weeks. That was why I didn't look to vaccinations
    initially. (I had to have my memory refreshed) 

    Measurements: 
    Thymus (L) 
    Small Intestines (R - 2nd proximal point) 
    Gallbladder (L - 3 end points) 
    Gallbladder (R - 2 end points) 
   
    2-7 Years Program: 
    Poliomyelitis, Anti-Tetanus, Diphterinum (these 3 nosodes cleared all
    points)  
    Support:
    Atropinum, Aesculus 
   
    2nd measurement:
    Small Intestines - 3rd point from end 
   
    2-7 Years Program:  
    Duodenitis, Duodenoheel (they seemed to balance the Small Intestines but
    didn't)
   
    3rd measurement:
    Small Intestines - 3rd point from end 

    <2 Years Program: 
    Veratrum, Mucosa, Dog Rose (mom and child's request... :) 
   
    Overall results:
    His father said he is seeing his son be more connected and focused since
    his treatments have started. He notices the changes more than the mother,
    because he is not with him all the time.

    I understand your thought process about the Vaccinations, but even if the
    colics started before the Vaccinations, there's always a need to correct
    the Hormonal System first in order for the body to heal and go beyond
    symptom treatment. 
    Since Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus are unlikely to not disturb the
    Hormonal System, these have to be dealt with within the first session....
    if they don't show up this is most likely a measurement problem.

    Sessions:
    Continued sessions until September => all points cleared using lots of Gall
    Bladder and Calcification remedies.
   
    Results:
    Improvement in symptoms, but the difficulty falling asleep at night has
    continued. 
   
    We had thought that the Footplates were helping him and were treating him a
    couple time a week, but now it appears that putting Atropinum in the
    Footplates gives him the best relief, and that only for one night. 
   
    They have been considering getting the Chikey, so they can give him
    treatments more often, but are hesitant because of the expense. 
   
    Question:
    1. I am wondering about putting remedies in the Footplates for a child. 
    2. What about the frequency of treatment with something in the Footplates?

    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    December 2013 edited December 2013 Flag
    If improvement happens only one night after a treatment, please look at
    what happens during the following day, what happens? 
    It could mean that the Atropinum is only capable of suppressing bad things
    for a day but that the cause is still there. The cause can also lie in the
    environment or his daily situation.

    Does he have electrical appliances in his bedroom? Cellphone? Computer? TV?

    Answers:
    1 & 2  A child of 6 doesn't need a Footplate treatment. The Atropinum will
    be as effective in the short 2-7 yrs hand treatment.

    Footplate treatments seemed to be positive for him when we have tried them
    though.... Is it possible that he would benefit from a 40 day dyslexia
    treatment when he is diagnosed Aspergers?… 
    We can't test the theory easily because he lives a distance from me and the
    most we've been able to test is twice a week.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    If you have treated all other imbalances and want to give the Dyslexia
    protocol a try, go for it! There can only be benefit from harmonising the
    two brain hemispheres. In Aspergers there's definitely an imbalance there.

    But only use Viscum, Thalamus and Cerebrum on the Footplates and don't use
    anything else.

    I don't know where the suggestion of 40 treatments comes from though. This
    is the most Johan has ever needed to treat dyslexia… I would first aim at
    10 treatments and then see whether it has made a difference (take a break
    of a couple of weeks to make a proper evaluation of the effects).

    January 2014 edited January 2014 Flag
    I think the 40 days was from the up to 40 days and morphed into thinking 40
    was standard, so thanks for the clarification.  That is much more doable
    starting at 10 days.  

    Questions:
    1. The Atropinum seems to be the only thing that helps him go to sleep
    easily. It only works with the Footplates and not with the Hand Rods…
   
    2. Can I add Atropinum to the Dyslexia Protocol? Every day, or maybe every
    4th day?
    Viscum, Thalamus and Cerebrum made no difference for him, whether I put
    them in with the Footplates or with the Rods.

    Hi Sharon,

    You say that all points cleared, but the sleeping hasn't improved. I really
    suggest that you continue measuring. 

    Something doesn't add up. If you still find that Atropinum is needed to
    relax his system, then there's definitely stress and that means a
    Gallbladder issue and most likely other digestive issues too.
    Have you found any food poisoning at all, almost all food poisonings have
    indications for sleeplessness? Did you restore his Intestinal Flora after
    you have treated him for Appendicitis?

    Answers:
    1. It is very unusual and interesting to see that Atropinum only works in
    the Footplates. All meridians are connected and the Remedy should also
    reach the Gallbladder meridian through the hands. Maybe it is just the
    short time of exposure to the Remedy that is not enough for his stressed
    out system….
    But it might also be an energetic block in the meridian system… a physical
    or energetic scar. Are you sure he is not in a Whiplash anymore or again?
    Because this is the most obvious reason for the Hand meridians to be
    disconnected from the Footmeridians… Look at an acupuncture doll, cut the
    head of in your imagination, and see what is left of "circulation" ;-).

    So since you can't measure anything anymore, and you'll have to go by the
    Symptoms (meridians not connecting, stress on the Gallbladder system). I
    would suggest to treat Whiplash again and see how that effects him. Maybe
    as a standard thing to do along with the Dyslexia treatment. I have seen
    that just 1 seizure can cause a new Whiplash…..

    2. Viscum, Thalamus and Cerebrum were later added to the Dyslexia Protocol,
    but are not part of it per se. Johan initially used only the Footplates,
    with the specific program he created and without Remedies. 
    If you find they don't do anything and Atropinum does, then I would just
    use that 1 Remedy.

    I so agree that there is stress on his system.  One of my biggest
    frustrations at this point with helping people is when all their points
    measure cleared (I really make an effort to measure carefully, which isn't
    always easy with a wiggly 5 year old, but he listens pretty carefully too
    as does his mother), but they still are struggling with symptoms.  He has
    had food poisoning in the past, and I did treat him with the 4 Bacteria one
    time.  

    I will definitely treat a Whiplash again!!  And I will do Gallbladder and
    digestion treatments.   I feel like I'm flying blind without any drops to
    measure...

    January 2014 edited February 2014 Flag
    I can see this feels difficult..
    When there's no measurement available that reflects the issues your client
    has, you have to become a little creative within the understanding of
    Biontology that you have.

    Trying to restore the integrity of his energy system would be my first
    choice…. So Whiplash Treatment, and then make sure every time he has a
    seizure or falls or something, it is done again. His mother has to be made
    aware of the importance of this. Does she have a Chikey?

    Also make sure there are no other Physical Scars that are left untreated.

    Since Viscum, Thalamus and Cerebrum don't do anything for the boy, maybe
    choose to use the Intestinal Bacteria and Atropinum on the Footplates for
    some time and see how that works out. 

    I hope you will follow up on how this works for the boy. 
    It is an interesting case that needs a different approach. This helps us
    all to learn.

    (Mind: this is not something that can be copied as a standard procedure! It
    is an adaption to this particular child's situation and response)

Neutralization Program and Dogs

Sylvia
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Programs Flag
I wanted to neutralize the possibility of ticks getting on my dog. She is 4
years old and had attracted 3 ticks in her life. 

Johan suggested that I take a live tick, put it in alcohol for three days then
put it in the cup and then run the neutralization program. I had my dog "hold"
the rod with the light in against her left paw. Does it matter which paw or
hand is used? In the weeks after she attracted over 10 ticks in freezing
weather so I'm now wondering what happened that instead of neutralizing she is
attracting them.  Would the left attract since we receive with the left?

I'm just baffled and hope to be able to do this correctly.

Thank you,

Sylvia

    Hello Sylvia, 
    this is a matter for Johan to comment on. From what you described you did
    it all right, Neutralization program , 40sec with the tick in the cup,
    Glassrod with blue light on the left paw. 

    The attraction part instead of avoiding them is what I want Johan to
    comment on. 
    I can't see any logic in attracting with the left paw, since we always use
    the left hand with the light, and the neutralization program does the work
    of inverting the information on its way to your dogs paw.

    Lets see if someone else brings in a comment and /or if Johan wants to
    comment on the issue himself.

    Hi Sylvia,

    Poor Star! 

    I'll try to give an answer....

    Since you only hold one rod with the Neutralisation Program, there's no
    circuit of light formed and then it shouldn't really matter in which hand
    or on which paw you put the rod although the receiving side has preference
    and is standard protocol. The information comes into contact with the whole
    field of the body either way.

    Here's a personal theory on what might have happened: 

    1) An important thing to realise is that with the Neutralisation Program
    there's no self correcting light circuit like in the normal treatment with
    two rods, so treating with only one rod, either through neutralisation or
    with a regular program, holds the danger that information that is not good
    for the body is brought into the energy system. 

    2) A functioning defence system reacts on foreign information with an
    opposite reaction, since the body always tries to correct for sudden
    changes. 
    The information of the tick is anti-information and would have neutralised
    the energy of a tick if it was present at the time of treatment. But maybe
    there was no tick at that time and the neutralised information of the tick
    was something the dog didn't really need. 
    Then I can imagine that the body reacts with an anti-reaction on the
    anti-tick since the anti-tick was not something the dogs body needed to
    correct anything. This would mean it has now a positive tick vibration that
    new ticks resonate with.

    To correct it, maybe you can make a homeopathic remedy out of the tick
    extract so you can run that in a normal program with the two rods. Do you
    still have it? I'll have to ask Johan of course on what he thinks.

    For me your experience with your dog is a good reason to be very careful
    with Neutralisation and only to use it when I know for sure somebody has a
    toxic load, allergic reaction to a substance etc. 
    Thank you for sharing this.

    Thank you, Karolina! I wondered about that and I also wondered if maybe
    Star was spin inverted and reacting in an opposite way. I have several
    ticks that I soaked in alcohol, all the ones I kept finding and just
    collected them. Normally they are frozen this time of year so that was even
    more rare.

    When I neutralized the tick it was in the cup and she had none in the body
    since I had taken them off. I need help with specific instructions as to
    how to make that homeopathic remedy from the tick.

    Just to make sure, you could try to do a Spin-Inversion program with saliva
    and run the program several times, since saliva is not as strong as blood.
    However I doubt Star was in a Spin-Inversion since she didn't have symptoms
    like being very tired. She actually looked very vibrant and happy to me
    last weekend… 

    For exact instructions on creating homeopathic remedies you might want to
    look on the internet. 

    This is how I've understood it: 
    D1 means diluting it 1:10 and then "activating" it by giving it 10 firm
    shakes or taping the bottle with the dilution hard on the palm of your hand
    10 times. Then you dilute it again 10 times and tap it ten times and you
    have a D2 potency. And so on.....

    Thank you, Karolina.  When you refer to the tick extract do you mean,
    squashing it?  Can I just stick the tick in water? 

    As far as the spin inversion treatment with saliva... would 3 times be
    enough or what is the average time needed?

    Thanks again,

    Another question about this... As i said, I did put the tick in alcohol for
    3 days and ran the neutralization program. However, in retrospect, I'm
    thinking that the tick had absorbed some of Star's blood. Would the
    neutralization program of a tick with her blood have an ill effect since it
    is in a sense neutralizing her against her? What would the consequences of
    this be and how can they be counteracted?

    Hi Sylvia, 

    With the extract I meant the alcohol remedy you created by soaking the
    tick... I personally have never made a homeopathic remedy, so I'll try to
    get Johan to answer this question on what is best to use... the squashed
    tick or the alcohol.

    For the Spin-Inversion treatment with saliva, 3 times seems sufficient.
    Especially for a dog since they react very quickly on the biophoton
    therapy. 

    I didn't understand from your first question that you took the tick from
    your dog. Nuetralizing her own blood doesn't seem like a healthy thing to
    do, however this still doesn't explain Star's sudden resonance with
    ticks...

    The "Waky Waky" procedure that Johan discovered to help people get out of
    coma is also done by neutralizing someone with his/her own energy. The only
    difference being that then two rods are used. So I don't think it is
    something to worry about that you used a bit of Star's blood in the
    Neutralization.

    Hi Sylvia,

    First of all, I have never seen an animal in Spin Inversion. So don't
    bother with the saliva.

    About creating a homeopathic remedy: When an organism is dying it radiates
    a 1000 times as much light than normal. If the tick died in the alcohol it
    contains this energy and you can make a homeopathic remedy from it.

    It is interesting to discuss why the dog attrachted instead of being
    invisible to ticks. I wonder what Johan means on this? 
    I have never treated dogs with ticks and with humans we strenghten the
    terrain so to speak and there has been various procedures to work with. 
    On Dogs and if you do not want to surregate measure to see where the drops
    are, I hope someone with experience with Dogs join the discussion with tips
    and thoughts.

    I would never neutralize something that isn't a problem. You can do
    experiments like this but not with the Neutralization program. Then there's
    no filter to prevent problems.

    The remedy should have been created by neutalizing the alcohol with tick
    information on a card and then it can be put in the Chiren and used with
    two rods and the filter. This is safe.

    The resonance is caused by the inverted information of the tick that you
    brought into the system of the dog.

    Thank you for your reply. I am a bit baffled since I'm unsure where I went
    wrong.

    I will copy my initial question to you and your response so you may help me
    out where I misinterpreted your response:

    Initial question:
    I'm thinking of natural remedies to get rid of fleas and ticks in dogs. Can
    I put a flea and a tick in the cup and run the neutralization program, will
    that work? I assume they need to be alive and that we have to do one at a
    time.
   
    Your response:
    The best way is always to neutralize that which attracts the ticks and
    fleas, but what is it? you can try to do the things you suggest but they
    need to be alive. Then put them in alcohol, let it sit for 3 days and then
    do the neutralization program.
   
    I am learning to prepare the homeopathic remedy and hope to run it today or
    tomorrow. We have about 3 feet of snow and I found another tick! 
   
    What I am interpreting from your explanation is that since the tick was no
    longer on her then it was not a problem and thus the information was
    reverted? I had thought that the tick was not so much the problem but the
    effects of it on a dog so by neutralizing the tick then the problem would
    be prevented. (dogs supposedly get Lyme's disease from ticks) Star has
    tested positive for having the antibodies of Lyme's disease but not the
    disease itself. 
   
    Above you mention this:
    The remedy should have been created by neutalizing the alcohol with tick
    information on a card and then it can be put in the Chiren and used with
    two rods and the filter. This is safe.
   
    To be clear... I put the remedy into the Chiren, then run the standard
    program with 2 rods on Star while using the remedy? Will that then keep the
    resonance at bay? Or, do I run he neutralization program with one rod and
    the remedy?
   
    Thank you,
   
    Sylvia

    I think the suggestion Johan made there was not clearly explained.
    Translation: he left the choice to you to experiment, and answered to two
    different questions. 

    1. How to get the energy into a remedy the best way, answer: 

    "Put them in alcohol while they're alive for 3 days"

    2. Would you treat the dog like this, answer:

    "I would suggest to find out what attracts the ticks, that is what I would
    do. But if you want you can try to neutralize the ticks." 

    The answer to that second question unfortunately doesn't state very clearly
    that there might be a risk involved if the tick is not a problem to the
    dog. You have to be very careful with the Neutralization Program, since it
    has no filter.

    Preparing a "Neutralized remedy" from the tick extract would have been the
    safest way to experiment, since nobody had done a thing like this in the
    past and the self-correcting treatment with two rods and the Standard
    program would make your experiment safer.

    If you run a remedy with a Standard Program and two rods it is not possible
    to add information to the system that is disturbing and you wouldn't create
    the resonance issue.

    Even getting her balanced again with a normal treatment, by maybe surrogate
    measuring Star on yourself, would probably get rid of the installed
    resonance. I don't know if it is a necessity to create that homeopathic
    remedy although it IS the most specific... and of course also a very
    interesting remedy to try for people with Lymes.

    I know that Circulation often improves because of a Treatment and that the
    Fingers are easier measurable after Standard Treatment. That is no
    Imagination.

    But to get Swollen Fingers is something that I have never seen. This would
    mean that an Underlying Condition would suddenly Express itself, which is
    not unusual either. 

    What do you measure on the Circulation Meridian before and after Treatment?
    I do not think that you are doing anything wrong.

    These patients that I am thinking of have Circulation issues that are
    caused by the Gallbladder, I know because after I measure them the first
    time, I pause and put in a Gallbladder remedy and it clears the drop. 

    But because I want to follow the Measurement Protocol, the Circulation is a
    priority, but the main culprit is really the Gallbladder, which doesn't
    really leave me much space to deal with if I already have for a few things
    from correcting the Triple Warmer (Berberis, Variolinum etc.) and the
    Kidneys too. 

    They seem to need Barijodeel and Aurumheel for sure and usually Placenta
    and or Aesculus. The Fingers then seem more Swollen between the hand and
    the knuckle when I am measuring them afterwards. I suppose it could be just
     getting everything "moving" or it's my choice of Treatment Order is
    incorrect.

    I am not sure that I find them easier to measure then, but I know I should,
    which is why I am checking in with you. 

    Should the Pancreatic Endocrine gland be Chelidonium or a nosode like
    Adenome Gallenblase, or is that too much? Or should I put in Gallbladder
    remedies first and then support or treat whatever Circulation drops remain
    on the Footplates?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    April 2013 Flag
    What Gallbladder remedy corrected the drops on Circulation when you first
    measured?

    If the Pancreatic Endocrine point on the Right Hand drops because of a
    dysfunction of the Gallbladder System, you'll be able to find a Nosode for
    this. So Calculi Bil, Billiary Cirrhosis, Cholecystitis, Adenoma
    Gallenblase...... It is important to always measure the Nosodes first.

    This way, you've addressed the Gallbladder when balancing the Triple Warmer
    and probably Circulation will show less drops (you've seen the effect of a
    Gallbladder remedy on the Circulation of this Client already...) and then
    most likely you'll need less remedies than you mention (4 is a lot for
    Circulation!).

    But Fingers can also Swell Up from an Inflammatory/Arthritic reaction,
    maybe a Flare Up....? Were the Kidney's balanced? Did the Swelling subside
    after you supported on the Foot Plates? 

    We need to have more insight in what you did or did not Treat.

Pregnancy - Can I Treat?

Good news, after only three treatments my client became pregnant! She had been
trying for 3+ years. 

The last time i saw her we did not know she was pregnant and so we started
detoxing her heavy metals. 

Question:

2. Any suggestions around continuing treatments while a women is pregnant?

    What Johan wrote in another post was, 3 to 4 nosodes in handrods, run the
    footplates with nothing in them. Also, Karolina advised not to make the
    treatment really heavy. And Halli writes that he thought it best to wait
    until the 12 week mark because the weeks before are vulnerable times.

    Now whether or not Halli is right, or Johan is right there are probably no
    scientific studies on this specific issue. However, it is true that
    miscarriage is most likely in the first 3 months, and you'll have to decide
    if you want the liability, or if she has a miscarriage, her doubts about
    Chiren treatment.

    There's no danger in treating if you take it easy.

    The warning of some therapists not to treat in the first 3 months is mainly
    because of the fear of being held responsible IF there is a spontaneous
    abortion that might have happened anyway. However, nothing like this has
    ever happened during biophoton treatment, pregnancies usually go a lot
    smoother.

As long as the body is in jet lag and thus adjusting to the time zone, the

    Answers:
    1. Yes you can treat yourself with the 2-7 program after travel, but you
    need to take the usual time in between treatments into account of course.
    2. Measuring will always be the most effective, and thus preferred method
    to balance yourself, also after travel.
    3. The remedies you suggest are good for a short session, but only to clear
    your own energy space. Other remedies may be needed... Food poisoning or
    Staph/Strep infections are also common after flying.
    4. It is a mistake to assume that Spin Inversion treatment will be needed
    in most cases. In fact, I hardly ever need it after clients have had long
    or short flights.

    It is interesting to hear the nosodes are made in D12 D30 and D200
    potencies. I am wondering about using the cup to send in remedies.

    First of all what does the cup do? My understanding of it is it takes in
    the energy of whats in the cup (blood pharmaceuticals) and amplifies the
    coherent light and inverts the non coherent light.

    Can we put pus from a clients infection or from a cyst boil in the cup and
    run a program to remind the body it has something to deal with. If we did
    that would it neutralize the the for pus in the body, or does it tell the
    body to expel the pus or both?

    Do you think it would be more effective to make a homeopathic solution of
    the pus and put it in the cup to remind the body to deal with the pus.
    Would we be more certain of its effectiveness if we made a solution of D12
    D30 and D200?

    I also wonder about the spring in the cup, is that just for running a spin
    inversion program or is it useful in other cases?

    Hi Johnty
    The cup is a extention to Chiren where you can place Information and then
    reading the Information you put in the cup and depending on what you choose
    to do you give the body information to start self correcting itself:
    . You can use it in 3 ways depending on program you choose.

    1. Spin Inversion program: put blood on a tissue on top of the Spiral and
    run a Spin-Inversion program of 2minutes holding both glasrods. On small
    children we recoment seliva instead of penetrating the skin, and to run it
    up to 3 times since it is not as effective as blood.
    Then remeasure if the spin is corrected.

    Now the teachings are that you can leave the Spiral in at all times, with
    spin and neutralizationprocesses.

    2. Use the cup to neutralize information in the body,  It can be a
    medication or a substance or a fluid on a tissue of paper. Run the
    Neutralization program of 40 seconds and then the Chiren inverts the
    information in the Cup and as you hold only ONE glasrod in your left hand, 
    You are receiving the inverted information into your body to correct
    whatever Information is in the Cup. Be aware that that not might be the
    cause, leading to a temporary change but not permament.
    To awoid symptom treating we want to address the cause not the symptom so
    we do not put puss and allergens in the cup and neutralize and "hope" the
    problem goes away because we train therapists to be good detectives to find
    the cause so that symptoms dissapears. 


    3. We can also use the cup to give the same information as in the Cup by
    running the Remedies program. this is mostly used by making a remedy or
    copy one. 
      Then the information in the Cup is not inverted but sent to your body or
    on the card in the exact same way. Some have tried to do so with sleeping
    disorder pills for example, to avoid side effects of the pill,. I would
    however, recommend to find the reason for having to take a medicine  since
    it does not seem to be effectfull for all who tries this method, and we
    work with the cause as mentioned above.
    . 
    4. When you want to Make a remedie or copy one,  this program and the cup
    can also be used or a footplate.. For that read the manual on copy remedies

    In your question about the client with infection and putting pus in the cup
    I would not at all recomment it. It is vital to measure the body
    Acupuncture Points and see what the body is telling, and then search for
    the cause; why is there puss, not neutralizing the puss as such.


    There is no quickfix here - and we want the body to change its signals so
    that no more puss is being produced by attending to the sourse, not the
    puss itself.

    So I would not bother to make a homeopatic solution of the pus but again
    attend to the cause to the problem, It is not what we teach, and Chrien
    includes all the remedies needed to correct a malfunction of the body.

    To be certain of effectiveness the principles of our methods are to work on
    the cause not neutralize or make nosodes but to take use of what Nosodes
    and Remedies we have in Chiren to make the body start correcting itself. 

    Good Luck

    Hi Nora

    I have a patient with allergy to Gluten. If I want to test her for that I
    will write a note saying Gluten, put it in a cup, and if I correct a drop
    with the note in the cup, I can leave the cup in the chiren and run the
    standard >12 program?  OR should I put a new note in the cup with the word
    1/gluten*200 or another fraction and then run the standard program?
    Most of the times I had used the cup for neutralising people relations etc.
    and of course spin.

    Hi Peter,

    Often gluten allergy is misdiagnosed so you can't just rely on this
    information.

    Allergy for gluten always has a cause, and you have to solve that cause.
    Plus the fact that using notes for treatment in these cases is not
    effective at all. I only use notes to identify an emotional problem and
    then talk about it. Then I also neutralize that note, but you always have
    to ask the client so they can express their problem. They have to express
    in order to let go.

    You better neutralize the gluten itself. But this can be dangerous since
    you can also create problems by neutralizing. See Sylvia's example with her
    dog. 
    http://www.biontology.com/vanilla/index.php?p=/discussion/38/
    neutralization-program-and-dogs
    There's no filter in the Neutralization program so it is not as safe as the
    normal hand treatments and footplate treatments.

    Safely treating with inverted gluten can be done by creating a Gluten
    remedy with the Neutralization program and then using this in a regular
    treatment with the two rods or plates. Of course only if you measure that
    it has a positive effect.

    Hi Johnty,

    Your understanding of the cup is correct in that it brings the information
    that is put in the cup into the Measurement or Treatment Circuit.
    When you run the programs: Remedies, Spin-Inversion, Dyslexia, Scars/
    Whiplash and the normal hand treatments the information in the cup is
    transferred the way it is. Only with the spiral in the cup the information
    is amplified.
    The only program that inverts information is the Neutralization/Allergy
    program.

    The misunderstanding you have about the cup is that it amplifies the
    coherent light and inverts the incoherent light. What you describe is the
    basic functionality of the Chiren that is used in every treatment where you
    hold two rods, but this has nothing to do with the cup.

    What you describe about creating a homeopathic remedy of someones own pus
    sounds like a lot of work since it should be potentized to a level of at
    least D11 to have an neutralizing effect. But if you want to experiment
    like this you should also ask yourself what you're trying to achieve...

    If it is trying to help the body expel pus, this can be an idea, although
    like Nora mentions, this is symptom treatment and we rather look for the
    cause and address that.

    The spiral in the cup can be used for all information you want to amplify.

    Hi Peter,

    When you test something with a note in the cup, you always have to put a 1
    over the disturbing information to invert it. So if there would be an issue
    with a person in your life this means that the note you use for testing is
    written like this:
   
    1/Name 
   
    If it corrects drops, for treatment you can then leave it in the cup. (you
    can run the normal program, since it is already inverted)
   
    The fraction part I've never heard of and is not something Johan teaches.
    The notes are there mostly to identify problems, since they do carry the
    information you put on there, but the energy in them is not as potent as in
    the homeopathic remedies. This makes them less effective in treatment then
    in diagnoses.

     Hi Karolina, I'd like to share that I have found that (not very often)
    when a client has come with a very unusual situation that "caused" their
    rapid and clear downfall or was a triggering event perhaps acelerating
    their disease. After following the initial important protocols of remedying
    I have in isolated instances measured with 1/over.  

    The case being with a boy who became disasterly ill after a Hep B
    vaccination in 1999. It has been a long road for us (as client and
    therapist) as he has been hospitalized  so many times since then and
    declared "incurable". 
    As part of his remedying we would measure for 1/hep B 1999 and it would
    match and I left it in the cup for remedying.  After many treatments and a
    long cycle of getting off almost 30 medications and opiates because he was
    finally out of pain, it did not measure anymore. 
    He is now by his defination "well", has gained his weight back and is a
    functioning individual.  Who knows if that was what helped but, it did
    measure until we did not measure or need it any more.  

    I found that in two other individuals who had very very rare bacterias that
    were taking them down. (one being my son) The combination of the chiren
    protocol,  Johan's astute observation about why he wasn't healing, and the
    use of 1/name of the necrotizing bacteria ( a very rare name here), I
    believe helped him heal when the tropical med. MD specialists could not. It
    was a rapidly declining situation.   I actually did discuss this 1/
    principle with Johan in class, and clarified its use as testing a known
    toxin,  ..

    Hi Jan,

    You have proven that the notes do not work as remedy (with toxins or
    diseases), because after the treatment, the next session the points were
    still dropping and measured for the note. 

    They don't work otherwise they would have balanced permanently. Think of
    the Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus vaccination. They are very damaging to
    everybody but if you've treated with these remedies, they don't show up the
    next treatment anymore.
   
    This is why I only use notes for measurement. We don't have all
    vaccinations, toxins, bacteria and parasites in the Chiren because it is
    not needed. With the right assessment and with following protocol it is
    hardly ever needed to add something else in my experience.
   
    To prove to yourself whether a remedy is working (on a note or otherwise),
    you have to test it separately from the protocol or any other remedy. This
    is the only way you can know if it does something.

    Thanks Johan.  I understand what you are saying.  But if I may ask just a
    little further.  Salmonella may show up several times until it is "gone" as
    with staph or strep, so...why would not the information for the toxic rare
    bacteria (1/toxin) show up several times until it was gone?
    I appreciate clarification on this.

    Hi Jan,

    Johan was referring to the HepB vaccination you used on the paper as proof
    that a note is not very potent as a remedy (vaccinations and toxins are not
    measured a second time usually unless there was a new exposure.), but notes
     can be used as a diagnostic tool. They can also open up a conversation
    about emotional problems and can be used in assisting with the energetic
    release of those problems by treating with them... 


    With bacteria there is often a source of re-infection and it is a matter of
    getting the immune system functioning to a point where it can deal with
    incoming bacteria again... And/or to pay better attention to food hygiene. 

    It is always the aim of Biontology to get the terrain in such a condition
    that bacteria are not able to thrive in the body anymore. Staph, Strep and
    Salmonella are so common that just leaving your house, touching something
    in a public space and then not washing your hands properly can infect you
    with all three...... The difference between someone who is affected by this
    or someone who stays healthy is their immune function.

    So the only way someone with recurring infections like these can be truly
    helped is by improving the immune system and as long as it is not
    functioning right it makes sense to be very careful to eat fresh clean
    foods and stay away from places with a lot of sick people (public
    transport, doctors offices etc.)

    Thanks Karolina, I appreciate the further clarification.  Still .... I do
    have a further question, sorry. I was more or less referring to (other than
    the hep B vaccination 1999 which took him down) the case of a fast moving
    (in this case flesh eating bacteria, necrotising facietis), where the
    infection moves faster in the client than the rebuilding of the terrain.
     Rare bacteria that have been identified, that we do not have in the
    instrument.
     Do you not think that identifying this as a possible toxin, since it has
    been cultured and is specific and measuring with it may hasten a criticical
    situation, while, of course working on the terrain. 
     I love the explanation Johan gave of the weak tree.  if we only go after
    the bugs and parasites the tree is still weak so we must strengthen the
    tree and work on the bugs and parasites we see, but the tree must become
    storng or it will attract more bugs and Parasites!  
    So I understand and deeply believe in this protocol, and my clients love
    this explanation! ....yet there are a few "runanway situations" with
    rapidly multiplying bacteria that I thought that 1/over the known toxin may
    be valuable as that is probably how many of the ones we were using were
    found.
    Thanks again....

    You still suggest that the note was needed and had an effect. This is
    something that you can't prove. 
    You assume that the terrain can't improve after one treatment and that
    it'll take a long time, but this is not my experience. 
   
    I've for example treated terminal AIDS patients that had multiple
    infections that I didn't have a remedy for and who were rapidly declining
    in health. In these acute situations it is possible to make a rapid
    turnaround, depending on the amount of energy a client has. It was never
    needed to address all these different infections. This is just an example
    of many cases I've had that proves that you don't need to address all
    different toxins and parasites.

    I was saying that with the protocol strictly adhered to if there was a
    bacteria known to be super toxic that was and invader such as one of the
    necrotising facietis (sp) ones then perhaps just as we use strep or staph
    or salmonella or any of the ones we have to fight what we see, as we
    importantly address the terrain, we should be able to invert a known toxin
    by inverting it by 1/over and test for it, as all information is ours for
    the asking, and..by asking if it is a toxin. it will be will be a match.

    Thanks Johan for further clarification. Although I was not assuming the
    terrain could not turn around in one session, yes I was/am wondering when
    someone's life is on the line and the infection is progressing at a rapid
    rate can a weakend system strengthen so fast without addressing the
    offender, as we do with food poisoning and other "bugs". My concern, not
    fear is I do think we are living in a time of "superbugs" undortunately and
    we have in the chiren inverted "bugs" to use but..sometimes we may need
    inverted "superbugs" to use to kill the bugs while strengthening the tree.
    Anyhow, I understand well that the terrain is of the utmost importance, and
    I thank you all for allowing me to think this through and question it. I
    really appreciate the forum for this.

    Just to make it absolutely clear, since I think somehow what I'm saying is
    not heard:

    My extended experience with the notes is that they do not work in treatment
     (toxins/diseases).... if you believe they do it is your intention at work,
    but it is important to make that distinction and to be objective.

    Intention is very powerful. So even telling people you're putting the note
    in can be healing.

    I've tested the notes objectively without putting any intention out and
    they do not work as such. So if you like the placebo effect that is
    wonderful because it is pretty powerful and healing, but I like to teach
    what works for everybody. And it is also important to know that that is
    what you work with.

    Also notes easily can cause projection and if you project something, you've
    lost all objectivity and might lose sight of the real underlying cause. 

    What is written on notes often stems from thinking (brain) and is therefore
    very unreliable.

    This comment and question is from  #1 Nora's description of the Spin
    inversion. 

    She said to put the tissue with the drop of blood on top of the copper
    spiral wire. 
    I always put the tissue with the drop of blood at the bottom of the cup.
    Was I
    doing this incorrectly, or was the way I was doing it just as effective? 

    And that brings up the other Question: 
    Now that we are to leave the spiral wire in the cup, should the notes go on
    top of the wire, or should they be stuffed down into the cup? 
   
     Are these stupid questions????

    When the tissue with blood or the note is surrounded by the spiral it's
    working. So the way you did it was fine and in your measurements you can
    see whether it worked or not. 

    A Spin Inversion should always be measured first. Standard treatment with
    Spin Inversion takes away the information about your client being in Spin
    Inversion at the beginning of the treatment or not.

    Not a stupid question at all. Thank you for asking!

    I am new at this, so I am sorry if this question has already been asked.

    On a new friend, after dealing with scars, and the Tripple Warmer and the
    associated treatments for spin/whiplash and you move on to the other
    points, having found a drop, can you enter a remedies until you find the
    one that addresses that drop, and then move on?

    So say I am all done the TW and i start with the small intestine and i find
    a drop.  I then enter a remedy and the drop is still there, so I take it
    out and try another and so on (usually I find one right away), can i leave
    that remedy in and then move onto the heart, and the organs, and the veins,
    arteries, and so on doing the same thing until the Q is filled.

    I must admit that between the manual and training and talking to different
    people i am still a little confused on some things.  Very glad to get on
    this forum.

    Thanks,

    Paul in Arizona

    Hello Paul,

    1. Saliva for Spin Inversion is less powerful and the treatment with own
    blood has added advantages to it for the body, but if there's no other
    option it is second best. You'll have to run it several times though for it
    to be effective.

    2. The protocol is to first measure all points on both hand and feet and
    then to start on the Triple Warmer to find remedies to restore the function
    of the Hormonal System. Every remedy that you find should always stay in
    the slot, when you continue to restore the rest of the meridians/points. 
    We're not looking to remedy point by point but to find as few remedies
    possible to restore the whole body. If you would, for example, find
    Appendicitis Necroticans on the Appendix point and then take it out to
    continue with other points to find remedies for them, this would make no
    sense, since this remedy often fixes many points at the same time. If you
    then, without the remedy, continue to a meridian that would have been
    helped by Appendicitis Necroticans it shows drops again and you start
    searching for a different remedy, while the point was already corrected....
     I hope this makes sense to you.

    No problem, everybody hast to get used to the forum. Next time you might
    want to open a new discussion.

    OK.  So check all the hands and feet and then go back to the TW and start
    treating.  So after getting through the TW and dealing with Scars,
    whiplash, and spin (if they show up) you start finding remedies for the
    issues that you find.  You leave those remedies in as you move on because
    they may elimate drops on other things that may have showed up?  If this is
    correct, then that is good as that is what i was doing.

    It does takes disipline to stop filling in slots and keep it to a bare
    minimum of nosodes.....for me.

    I like to measure, and sometimes I get  a match when I then remove the
    remedy from the slot. I wonder if the emty  slot also find its ressonance.
    So is it ok to treat with zero remedies?

    The resonance of a remedy stays active in the body for a couple of minutes
    after measurement. You have to wait a couple of minutes before the
    influence of the remedy is gone and the point starts dropping again. So it
    is not the empty slot that resonates.

    I think this is what you meant.
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    February 2013 edited February 2013 Flag
    Treating with no remedies is ok as a preparation and this will clear a lot
    of minor imbalances, but the core issues will remain there to measure and
    treat with remedies. 

    But you can't know by measurement which drops are going to clear before
    you've done this treatment and you won't address core issues. To have
    successful treatments and not just some symptom relief, remedies are
    essential.

    I have 2 questions on the last notes from Johan.

    1/ the resonance of a remedy stays for a couple of minutes: what is the
    impact of this when you put another remedy in the same slot, after removing
    the first one? Is there influence from one to the other? What do you do
    waiting a couple of minutes? ... measuring next points and return?

    2/ Preparation: isn't there the same risk as with spin, that you mask
    information? Could this help when you don't find drops? (beside the other
    possibilities of hidden spin, endorphines,...)

    The whole discussion here is very interesting, with lots of different
    items, creating more questions, that I try to put on the right places.

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    1/ If a remedy doesn't match there is no resonance, and no effect, so you
    can continue to measure for other remedies without having any influence of
    the first remedy you tested (on this point/meridian). If you have a match
    of course you're not changing it (keeping in mind that you followed the
    right order of testing, so nosodes first). If you would measure a flower
    that corrects a point and then want to take it out to find a proper nosode
    you have to wait until the point starts dropping again (couple of minutes).

    If a remedy doesn't have resonance with the meridian you're working on it
    can still have an effect on other meridians and this influence might
    "stick" for 5 minutes... This is a good reason why we have to check, check
    and check again. 

    2/ Can you be more clear in your question? Do you mean that the Spin
    Inversion Program (spiral and blood)  is masking information? This is not
    the case, the Spin Inversion Treatment is very potent (but you have to use
    fresh blood every time) and healing.
   
    Using a short hand treatment as preparation has no added information except
    for the body's own light that is filtered and given back to the body. This
    will only influence the more "flexible" energetic problems and not the
    deeper issues that are the cause of the chronic condition, with which the
    body has difficulty solving and that caused an imbalance to become a
    disease.... The bigger drops will remain to work on. 
    With information that resonates but is somehow weaker in its effect, the
    problem is that also the bigger drops can be corrected, while the remedy is
    not strong enough really change something in the condition. Because of this
    you can have a huge loss of information.

    Has something changed with the information about obtaining new blood every
    time? I thought we just drew blood once and then kept it with their file to
    use again if they ever needed another spin inversion done again?

    Thank you for all this information. It is really clearing up a lot of
    questions I had coming out of the class, which once you get home, you

    I never use (or have used) old blood for Spin Inversion. Blood holds
    information about the client from the moment it was drawn. You'll keep
    bringing in old information. 
    It is best to have a 100% resonance with the blood and this is only true
    for blood that is fresh.

    I think some practitioners, who didn't like to draw blood, started to use
    old blood.

    Johan, 

    On wednesday I treated a client for Spin Inversion and then used the blood
    to treat them. Later, I treated myself with support remedies and the blood
    that was in the cup from my last client. 

    I did not notice the blood from the patient was still in the cup. I started
    to have flu like symptoms on wednesday afternoon and was quite low on
    energy all day yesterday. Any suggestions regarding this situation.

    Yes, that happens sometimes, even to me.

    If you have used the normal programs (with two glass rods), then the blood
    should not have an effect on you since their blood has no resonance with
    you. 

    If you developed flu symptoms, it could have a variety of causes including
    the weather, a solar storm.
    a food poisoning with collapse does the same thing. 

    Did you measure yourself after this happened?

    At the top of this thread it is stated “Now the teachings are that you can
    leave the Spiral in at all times, with spin and neutralization processes.” 


    1. If we were to neutralize a substance such as a medication after someone
    has stopped taking it, do we put a piece of tissue on top of the spiral so
    the medication does not fall through the spiral and into to the bottom of
    the cup?


    2. Do we remove the spiral when TESTING for a supplement or medication
    (since we only leave the spiral in for neutralization and spin programs). 


    3. If testing with a note with 1/name or issue would we also put that on
    top of the spiral in order to amplify the note since they are weaker than
    an actual substance?  Would this then be a third time when we use the
    spiral in addition to the neutralization and spin programs that you
    mentioned above? 


    4. What points are best for testing a note or emotional issue?  I’m
    thinking possibly the hormonal system assuming it has a drop?  Any other
    points/meridians? 


    5. How would you test the note if there is no drop on the meridian you want
    test it on?  Would you then put it in the cup without using a 1/ (one with
    a line over the issue) and see if the point drops?

    1. I only use tissue when the substance to be neutralized is fluid or a
    powder so that the cup is not affected.

    2. There is no need to remove the spiral, since the spiral amplifies the
    strength of the signal.

    3. The substances or notes are to be put within the spiral. I would not use
    the spiral with notes, in fact I would not use notes at all.

    4. There are no specific points to test with emotional issues.

    5. Again, I would never treat with notes. 

    4. & 5. If I would test with notes, I would always test the organs related
    to the emotions as described in the 5 element teaching, or even better I
    would connect the patient to the biofeedback system and address the issue.
    If it causes stress, then the body is affected. But I always talk about it
    and bring everything on the table. Then I bring the issue to the conscious
    level. Then it can be dealt with.

    1. About the Neutralization Program. I remember Johan mentioning how he
    neutralized an organization by putting its name in the cup, isn't this a
    good example of how notes can be effective? However in the discussion above
    I would interpret that putting a name of someone in the cup and then
    neutralizing it would not work?

    2. In the case of a bully in a child's classroom, we use the photograph of
    the entire class between the foot plates and run the 2-7 program. Why would
    we not run the neutralization program with only the photo of the bully? 

    I used this advise for two children (brother and sister) who were being
    bullied terribly in their respective classes. Out of 7 children that were
    aggressors 6 left the school within a month and the one that remained has
    been isolating himself and not bothering anyone anymore. The mother was
    very pleased because her children are now happy in school.

    Hi Sylvia,

    The main thing is that Johan says that using notes to neutralize toxins/
    substances doesn't work in his experience and that he discontinued that for
    this reason.  

    He continued to use the notes for other issues (people, situations etc.)
    for a while, because that does have an effect (in my experience too), but
    now he sees it as something that has to do with Intention rather than with
    the notes themselves. You can keep using the notes as a tool if you need
    to, but have to keep in mind that it is the Intention that works and also
    the consciousness that arises because the focussing on the subject together
    with your client.... I believe it is more the power of the Mind then the
    power of the note anyway, although the Intention gets connected to the note
    of course (that's why it can be measured). ;-) 

    The photo is a different subject. That is more treating on a distance of
    the energy of the whole class. There was no note involved. 
    Neutralizing the bully would be more of a symptom treatment then
    harmonizing the whole class. Since it is something in the group dynamic
    that is not functioning.

    Thank you. Now I understand it better. I have not used notes myself since
    there has been no need but was curious. So, if one were to neutralize a
    bully, would the photograph only be on the plate with the blue light
    instead of in between? I understand this is a symptom. Would it cause any
    harm to the child or is it otherwise safe? I've become very respectful of
    this program and want to understand it further in different cases.

    Personally I wouldn't Neutralize the "bully". 
    It is never a person that is the cause of anything. It is always the 
    dynamic between two people that creates problems. And since you've seen
    what the Neutralization Program can do if you Neutralize things that are
    not really a problem (because of the lack of a filter), I would feel very
    concerned about all aspects of this boy being Neutralized at the same
    time.... It also denies the cause within the child that is being bullied
    and puts all the blame on the bully. I wouldn't consider this holistic
    treatment at all...

    Putting the bully in between the footplates would harmonize his energy and
    might help him, better is even to put a picture of the bully + the boy that
    is bullied between the footplates because then you harmonize their
    relationship. When a picture of the class is put in between the plates, the
    whole class dynamic is addressed in this way.

    I had understood the Neutralization Program as a program that could
    neutralize the negative but now I see the difference. I thought it would
    neutralize the actions of the bully. This is very enlightening. I love the
    idea of harmonizing a relationship.

Afraid of Going Blind

Carol
January 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client: 
56 year old male with high anxiety about going blind.  

Symptoms: 
Born with weak muscles in his right eye and to strengthen them he wore a patch
over his left eye at age 7 .
Declining of distance vision at age 48. Increasingly light sensitive (wears
sunglasses when outdoors). Diminished night vision. "Silvery spot" in the
middle of his field of vision when intentionally opening and closing eyes (not
when just naturally blinking) and when waking up, and opening eyes.
Great fear and anxiety about going blind after diagnosis ophthalmologist.

Medical diagnosis: 
Pigmentation changes in his macula which could lead to blindness.

Third treatment, drops on the following meridians:
Small Intestines, 
Heart, 
Lungs, 
Veins, 
Circulation, 
Nervous System, 
Large Intestines, 
Lymphatic System, 
Bladder, Kidneys, 
Gallbladder, 
Stomach, 
Liver - screaming points and dropping points

Treatment hands:
Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis, Chronic Tonsillitis, Brucella Abortus Bang,
Campylobacter Pylori, Brucellosis, Gastritis, Ulcus Duodeni

Dyslexia Program:
Streptococcus Viridans, Diverticulosis, Billiary Cirrhosis, Ulcus Ventriculi,
Hep B with EB, Mercury, Cholecystitis, Kieferostitis

Half way through changed to:
Streptococcus Heamolyticus, Nux Vomica, Atropinum, Mucosa, Chelidonium,
Populus, Hepar, Galium

All drops were straightened out.

My understanding is that his sight issues comes from the Stomach meridian.  
His fear is so great, I wanted to check in on the Forum to make sure that I am
not missing something.

Thank you for any ideas you can share with me.

    Carol, If it's any help my mother is 80 with macula degeneration since her
    50's. She is not blind but has given up driving. Everyone progresses at a
    different pace.Maybe the Chiren will improve him? Fear will probably
    accelerate the process so if you can help calm that perhaps things will go
    better?
   
    Also I wonder what Johan would say about the glasses. Once your client has
    cleared the mercury maybe he will be less light sensitive. Johan do you
    think stopping the glasses then might be a good idea? Could this slow the
    autoimmune process allowing light more directly to the brain?
   
    Impressive number of nosodes needed to balance his light!

    Hi Carol (and Toril), thank you for asking this as my understanding too is

    is primarily governed by the Liver -  so I look forward to learning more
    here about the cause of sight issues (which Johan says is different than
    "vision")  and what else to look for, as I have a new client coming with
    very rapidly declining sight and extreme light sensitivity issues. 
     
    And .... re: macular degeneration.... something they have been sharing
    lately in the medical community, which you probably know Toril, is that
    they now believe the practice of an aspirin a day, as has been prescribed
    for so long by Drs. to keep the blood thin, is now considered a
    contributing factor in (wet) macular degeneration.

    Hi Carol,

    The eye-symptoms are clearly related to problems with the Liver, Stomach
    and Small Intestines and by looking at the remedies you've measured this is
    also what you found.

    To have an effective treatment you need more focus on the problem and the
    right sequence of treatment, since now because of all the nosodes the
    healing energy goes in all directions and only little is available for the
    core issues.

    Eventhough you measured a need for all these nosodes, you have to try to
    reduce them the next time to direct the energy more effectively. The
    challenge is to get as many systems balanced with as little remedies as
    possible. So here is some advice on what to do:

    If there are so many points dropping, the case is always Appendicitis or
    Tonsillitis. Chronic Appendicitis and Chronic Tonsillitis are the first
    things you have to focus on always when you measure them, since they are
    the cause of many problems and gastro-intestinal issues won't be solved as
    long as they are present. 

    Now you have to find a way to reduce the amount of remedies that are needed
    to correct the most important organ systems. Right now it is just too much
    information. Especially too many nosodes. Too many nosodes lead to too
    heavy detox.
   
    This can be an example how you can be a detective in finding a more
    effective combination of remedies:
   
    The bacteria nosodes might correct some points but if you address another
    issue like gallbladder cirrhosis or inflammation and leave the bacterial
    nosodes out you might find out that this also corrects the points that you
    needed the bacteria nosodes for. So this way you address a bigger issue and
    the more acute issues (food bacteria) are solved at the same time. You need
    to improve the TERRAIN.
   
    This was an example and not something that is always like this! It can also
    be the other way around, in which case you find out that one bacterial
    nosode has such a big effect on the system that it corrects more points
    then for example the Cholecystitis issue.

    The idea is to discard the nosodes that have little effect and use the ones
    that have a bigger effect, especially on the systems you want to correct
    first (elimination pathways). The less nosodes you need the bigger the
    treatment effect will be. But always use nosodes, because these are the
    remedies that really make the difference. But never use too many nosodes.

    Dear Carol on this case: 
    you say the Liver is having high measurements and screaming sounds. It
    indicates the liver is having high endorphins so I would suggest you keep
    your nosode search within the Liver meridian:
    Try Zirrhose hepatis: does the hight endorphins drop? do you get more
    "normal" readings? does it still drop? 
    As soon as you mention that the client has a sensitivity towards ligth and
    wears sunglasses, I immideately think of Liver even if Yes the stomach and
    eye connection is there. This is clearly a liver case: 
    I would measure on the LIver to see which Nosode brings the
    Livermeasurements down, is it Kidneys that is malfunctioning? can you
    measure again if Mercury is on his Liver? Even test Rubella or other
    vaccinations since he had the problem since he was very young (7) Liver
    controlls the strenght of the muscles. Can you test him on Pfeiffer and EB
    again? I seems to me a Liver-trouble since you already have measured him on
    EB-virus too. Check which of the Hepatitis'es that match too. Support:
    Hepar, Hepeel, Galium? Ubichinon, Glyoxal, Cozenzyme, Ergotheel and check
    Veratrum which Johan sais is good for the eyes, but nothing of the support
    would give miracle results if the cause is still there. 
    I agree with Karolina: narrow down to one area- fint out why the Liver is
    hight. Minimum number of Nosodes with the Maxium effect.

    Hi

    I do not agree with Nora's explanation or with her plan of attack.

    a) The screaming sounds are caused by the humidity on the toes, If you hear
    very high sounds, especially on the feet, you need to dry the feet and
    reduce your pressure. 

    b) The liver is often high in endorphins (which gives normal straight
    sounds) and you need to wait until it shows itself by itself. The Liver
    always comes last. The other problems are not Liver related and need to be
    addressed first. The anxiety, the fear are Gallbladder/Kidney/Bladder
    issues, but the declining vision is a Stomach/Small Intestine issue. 

    These organs of course all influence each other and the Liver also does
    have a problem in this case. It is all a matter of the right treatment
    sequence. The Liver will show itself when it is ready.

    Thank you to all who responded! 

    Karolina thank you for your very thoughtful and measured response.  I have
    just one further question: you wrote, "because of all the nosodes the
    healing energy goes in all directions and only little is available for the
    core issues.  and then later you wrote,  Too many nosodes lead to too heavy
    detox.   I am probably not understanding this correctly but, these two
    statements seem like a contradiction to me.  Will you please explain the
    correlation between the use of too many nosodes having the effect of only a
    little healing energy going to core issues, and too many nosodes leading to
    too heavy detox?
   
    Nora~During his treatment today I found Penicillin on the Liver.  After
    that he told me he was given a lot of Penicillin when he was a child.
     Whenever one of his brothers got sick and needed antibiotics, he was given
    Penicillin too, even if he wasn't sick!
   
    Johan~To clarify about about his Liver points: On the Liver meridians, he
    had some dropping points and some points which were extremely high and
    sounded to me like they were screaming.  He had a combination of dropped
    points and extremely high points ("screamers") on both the left and right
    foot liver meridians. (No points on any other meridians sounded as if they
    were screaming.)  His feet did not feel nor appear wet to me.  During his
    treatment today, none of the points screamed and he had fewer dropped
    points. 
    I never treat the liver until it shows itself with dropped points. I
    learned that from you.  :)
   
    I am delighted with all I am learning from the Forum.  
    Thank you all for your generous input.

    Hi Carol

    This is not a contradiction. Energy dispersed in all direction causes every
    impulse (remedy) to diminish in effectiveness. There is detox all over, but
    no organ has enough energy to deal with it properly. 
    And also the elimination channels (yang organs) are not healthy yet, so you
    give the body the impulse to get rid of toxins while it is not ready yet!
    This is why the Liver should never be treated before the Yang Organs are in
    order. Penicillin was definitely not the most beneficial choice.

    Detox seems almost like a magical word, in that it is considered always a
    very good thing by many and that more is better.... The energy should be
    directed to what is really necessary to address first.
    To determine this, symptoms and measurements should be taken in
    consideration and then you can choose the direction you're going to take.

    About the screaming Liver points:
    Then you should use less pressure on those points. The big toe contains
    more fluid and usually sounds more clear than other points. 
    Comparing the sound of one point in two different sessions is almost
    impossible since you don't remember the amount of pressure you put on the
    probe, the amount of water used, the exact sound it created..... etc. In
    the assessment we only focus on drops or no drops, slight drops or steep
    drops.

    Please read other comments on the "screaming" points issue. It is
    distracting and not true.

    "….if I ever hear another screaming point.."
    It might also be that you interpret a clear sound as "screaming", while it
    is actually a healthy sound…
   
    Just put the whole concept of "screaming sounds" away.

Chikey Capability

Is it possible to administer liquid remedies, that have been created by the

Perhaps by placing the vials in the cup that is plugged into the Chikey spin

Foot Problems (Stiffness and Pain)

George
May 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag

Client:
68 years old woman with stiff right foot, started treatments yesterday.
Used to be a nurse, is an art painter now.
In the last few years she has visited several alternative therapists

History:
Born during WWII => no childhood vacinations
Cancer of the uterus years 20 ago => treated with Radiation
Excess Bone Growth causing Protrusion 40 years ago => Instep both Feet chiseled

Medical Diagnosis:
Neurologist measured malfunctioning of the nerve that runs from hip to toes. He
told her this was caused by an inflammation she has had there.

Symptoms:
High blood pressure
Stiff and painful right foot
Inability to lift up toes of right foot when foot is flat on the ground.
Inability to unwind right foot from heel to toes because of stiffness =>
difficulty walking, prone to falls
Symptoms started after inflammation of the hip (5 years ago)
After the hip inflammation she suffered from "foot drop", which subsided, but
stiffness and pain remain.
Right foot slightly thicker than left one.
Excess bone growth on the insteps of both feet and another small bone
protrusion on her right foot
Cold hands and feet

1st Session:

Measurement:
Adrenal Glands, Insulin (L), Thymus (L), Small intestines (L - all points), 
Gallbladder (R - 1 point), Kidney (R - 1 point)

Weak points (not clearly dropping but not good either):
Parathyroid and Thyroid
Circulation (L)
Veins (L)

Treatment:
Whiplash (neck with glass rods) => made Parathyroid and Thyroid sound
'stronger'
Scar (electrodes) => on the insteps of both feet
Scar (glass rods + Neuralgo Rheum) => entire lenght of the nerve from toes to
hip 


> 12 Years Program:
Salmonella Typi*, Brucellosis*, Calculi Biliaris*


Footplates:
Selenium*, Berberis*, Chelidonium, Atropinum, Placenta, Viscum, Thalamus, Cerebrum
The remedies marked with * cleared drops/weak points
After treatment all drops and weak points were cleared.


Questions:
1.What suggestions can you give for further treatment?
2. Should I focus on the nerve that runs from the toes to the hip?
3a. Could scar treatment with the rods help the damaged nerve to regenerate?
3b. If so, after how many treatments could I expect results?
4. What remedies could I use (in support)
5. Or should I focus on other systems for example Nervous system (what
remedies) or Liver (muscle strength)?

    1. Because she is/was a nurse, she must have had many Vaccinations. They
    are compulsory for nurses. Perhaps not in childhood, but certainly later in
    life. So it seems odd that you didn't find them. Never assume anything, but
    work by the protocol.

    Her Stiffness is definitely a Circulatory Issue, which can be caused by the
    Gallbladder or the Calcium metabolism which is definitely wrong. She is
    likely to have a hardening of the Arteries.

    2. The "Nerve" issue that she has is probably not a Nerve issue, but a
    Gallbladder Meridian issue, which can also be the cause of her Circulation
    problems

    3a. Treating the Meridian locally with Scar treatment is not necessary at
    all if you follow protocol properly. It can help with Symptoms, but NEVER
    use it before you have gone through the standard procedure of measurement
    and treatment. Symptom treatment should be done at the end of the complete
    Session.

    3b. you never know in how many treatments you can see results, It is the
    client's body which has to do the healing and all depends on the
    regenerative capabilities of her body. 

    4 & 5 I would treat with the normal Vaccinations, then focus on the
    Gallbladder and Circulation

    Also "weak points" is something you shouldn't focus on. A point gives
    either a drop or a straight sound/graph, that is all we need to know to see
    whether a Point/Organ System is healthy or not. High and Low sounds mostly
    say something about local circulation, moisture, dry skin/callous etc....

Dog with Skin Problems

SVitale
July 2014 edited July 2014 in Animals Flag
Dog:
Schipperke with skin problems. He is on human grade food. 

Symptoms:
Extreme itching 
Hair loss 
Self-biting  
Seems happy
Eats well
Poops twice to three times a day  

Diagnostic tests:
Tested once for skin fungus => showed negligible amounts = considered normal. 

Measurement:
I don't know how to do a surrogate measurement, nor do I have anyone who is
'cleared' to act as a surrogate as of yet, so I did not measure.

Treatment:
Short programs with all classical Skin remedies (Psorinum, Schwefheel,
Graphites, Cutis, Placenta, Causticum), along with Kidney support

Results:
Slight changes:
More calm => but the problem still exists.  

I wondered about using a 'nosode' of his secretions, he often has ear exudate.
I think this symptoms are really due to vaccines, since he is a 'rescue' and
has had many vaccines.  

Questions:
1. Would I use the remedy mode or the neutralization mode, I think the
neutralization mode would correct but not sure, remembering the 'dog tic'
entry. 
2. Do I have to get the exudate to a 10D potency?  Or will the inversion work
with the neutralisation?  
3. What are you suggestions?  
4. I also wondered if the future upgrades would include dog and cat vaccines.
This would be an asset.

    Serum Ovile, Psorinum, Atropinum, Reneel, Viscum, Schwefheel, Procranium,

    My thinking:  
    Serum Ovile => Vaccine reaction.  
    Psorinum, Schwefheel => Skin Issues
    Procrainum => Stress, Cellular defence, Pituitary
    Atropinum => Stress
    Viscum => Pituitary  
   
    Possible cancerous development: Procranium, Viscum....

    biting himself....

    There are many causes that lead to itching: 
    * It might be that the body tries to excrete something
    * there could also be a circulatory issue, that for example, dries out the
    skin

    Answers:
    1&2. Don't neutralise anything without creating a remedy (with the
    Neutralization program) and testing it first. The ear exudate is a result
    and not the underlying cause of the problem, so I would not suggest
    neutralising this at all.
    3. One treatment that you could do is the Whiplash. Other treatments you
    could do is treat with Food Poisonings or Heavy Metals. Dogs often have
    these since they live low to the ground. 
    4. It is usually not necessary to neutralise vaccinations in animals. If
    you want to determine if the vaccinations in fact are the cause or trigger
    for the problem, you need to set up a time-line first. If the dog did not
    develop symptoms within two months after receiving the vaccinations, you
    can exclude them as cause.

    Now, I'm confused...

    Questions:
    1. We, as humans are affected by vaccines all our lives, this is the
    premise of the Biontolgy protocol, yet you say that dogs are not?  Can you
    explain why?

    2. I don't know if the dog was affected poorly by the vaccines since I
    received him from the 'rescue' service. I know that many dogs do, but as we
    do with ourselves, it's ignored.   

    I did not mention I already treated in independent treatments:
    Whiplash (he has a history of shoulder/neck spasm)  
    Heavy metals 
    Food poison (he was found, lost and obviously scavenging for food)
    Pesticides 

    Results:
    Did not seem to help yet, maybe he was not ready yet

    Thanks for you advice....I'll keep trying....

    Answers:
    1. Vaccinations can cause big disturbances, but are not the foundation of
    Biontology. Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus are definitely always disturbing
    for humans, and yes these are part of the protocol, but many of the other
    vaccinations are almost never needed in treatment as they don't show up in
    measurement. The body can often deal with them without the specific
    homeopathic information.

    In theory the biophoton treatment alone -without remedies- should balance
    every disturbance that shows up in the light, but in practice especially
    adult people have chronic/stubborn conditions that need an extra
    "informational push". This extra push is what the remedies are for. Dogs
    and other animals react far more sensitive to the treatment and they also
    do not suppress things like humans do, so maybe this is why they do so well
    without the specific vaccinations… Animals in my experience always react
    extremely well to the light treatment.

    Since the dog did not react to all the previous treatments (mind that
    usually the light without the remedies already gives a positive response in
    animals!), the problem can be malfunctioning of the Kidneys/Bladder. So I
    would use Kidney and Bladder support the next time you treat your dog.

    2. If you want to treat all vaccinations that dogs get in the shelter
    anyway, you need to find out what they are and then find a liquid
    homeopathic remedy of a good quality. Or get all these vaccination fluids
    and make remedies with the neutralization program… The function to create
    and add remedies is part of the Chiren so practitioners who have their own
    ideas and desires can find them themselves.

    I do not know the frequency and number of treatments you have given, since
    you now say that you have given other "independent treatments", but just to
    make sure you are not over treating your dog:

    Frequency of treatment should be maximal once every 5 days a short 2-7
    years program. So no more than 1 short treatment with a maximum of 8
    remedies.

    I made a trip to the veterinary clinic with an injured dog. While waiting,
    a great number of people were in and out to pick up prescriptions for their
    animals. 

    With so many required vaccinations, medications, food additives (GMO,
    preservatives, animal hormones, pesticides, etc.) we are seeing more and
    more health issues in animals. All these prescriptions, vaccinations,
    spaying and neutering are government regulated and money makers which make
    our animals immune system unhealthy with suppressed issues. They are doing
    the same with animals as with humans. 

    So many animal health and psychological issues I never heard of years ago
    are so rampant now. Why???? The same reasons people have so many health and
    mental issues. 

    Animals are more in tune with healing and the light therapy, but not exempt
    from the unhealthy lifestyles owners give them "intending" to do the right
    thing, which is actually more harmful.

    Treatment
    I once treated a dog with itching, biting and dry skin. She had worse
    reactions in summer (i.e. loss of hair, more itching and dry scabby skin)
    which "seemed" to be aggravated by the foliage.

    I initially treated her mainly with supports after treating for the obvious
    food poisonings, insecticides, metals, vaccinations Serum Oville,
    Vaccininum and the skin issues you listed in your second treatment. This
    made her some better, and would relieve symptoms for awhile, but never went
    totally away. 

    She had a Lyme tick bite after which she developed lethargy and Lyme
    symptoms. After measuring, I treated her for Lyme after which she became
    more active. 

    A month after the Lyme treatment, she had a severe, severe skin reaction
    which seemed to be internally as well as externally.
   
    Symptoms
    >Extremely itchy and biting, hair loss flakey and scabs.
    >Dragging her flattened body across blacktop, carpet or anything abrasive,
    even at night disrupting sleep.
    >Dark red-purplish swollen skin all over, even around eyes, ears and paw
    pads.
    >Her underside breast area became hard, swollen and inflamed as if she had
    just delivered and was nursing pups. The tissue under the skin seemed to be
    enlarging / getting thicker. Her back / bottom end was swollen and pushed
    outward.
    >Skin was extremely hot.
    >She also had an odd odor (not real strong though).
   
    Treatment & Results
    >So this time I symptom treated as for endometriosis. I went deeper with
    cancerous, fungal and tissue nosodes (thyroid = growth) and then supported
    well with drainage and tissue supports. 
    >At each session, I used the whiplash / scar treatment many times with the
    glass rods all over her body. 
    >After three treatments, she was settled and happy, odor gone and very
    little itching even though she had always been an itchy dog. The swelling
    in her breast area continued to decrease until it was gone.
   
    Other
    >I usually surrogate measure and get very accurate readings for what is
    going on with the animals, but in this case I had no extra time and it was
    more of an emergency or they would have had to take her to the veterinarian
    for treatment.

    Hi Ronda, I appreciate your post.  Can you explain treated for
    'endometriosis'...
    I agree, dogs are being over treated more and more so the resilience is
    lessening in them.  I have a 'rescue' and the changes he has gone through
    since I've had him have been major.  First, severe neck and shoulder spasm,
    most likely due to food poisons, toxins,vaccines etc.  this took some three
    winters to resolve with herbs.  Since he is a rescue he was 'treated' by
    the pound, then the Schipperke club and who knows what he ate when lost. 
    When we got him he would eat anything, quite unusual for a Schipper: I use
    to 'ask' my other Schipper if the meat was good, if he refused to eat it,
    we would not.  As you can see from above, a year and a half ago he started
    itching due to increase fleas, pesticides and who knows.  I began treatment
    with herbs,(before Chiren) and he went thru various stages of skin
    problems. 

    Presently I have begun food poisons as a focus. This last treatment
    resulted in hair loss on the lumbar spin, increased ear exudate with some
    blood. His spine are is healing rapidly so I know its a healing. 

     I do not do surrogation yet since I have not fully cleared myself or my

    My dog, Buddha has responded well to a neutralization of ear exudate.  I
    ran the neutralized remedy once (in a standard program) with about a 70%
    improvement. I also made a salt remedy of the exudate for oral use. Hoping
    for the best.

Anemia

megan_wick
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Symptoms Flag
I have a close friend who has Anemia, as diagnosed by her doctor, and was
recently notified that her Iron is So Low that its not even detectable in her
Blood. 
I haven't treated her yet due to the distance in which we live, but am planning
on her coming and living with me for a few weeks to get treatments. 

Her doctor told her her organs, mainly Heart, Kidneys, Liver, and even Brain
are starting to shut down. Where would you suggest to start with this?

    Intake, Absorption, Production and Loss....

    What does she Eat, how is her Digestion, does she have Heavy Bleedings (or
    any form of Blood Loss) and is Iron the only Mineral or Vitamin she lacks?

    These are things to first Assess before you know what to treat. 

    1. Liver => Chronic Liver disease can lead to destruction of Blood Cells,
    Blood loss (impaired coagulation), nutritional deficiencies.

    2. Diet => If it is a matter of Diet this needs to be addressed along with
    the Treatments. Also think about the effect of Phytate, Oxalate or other
    Anti-Nutrients that often are a Cause for Malnutrition in supposedly
    Healthy Diets (Especially Raw and Vegan, although there are many possible
    benefits to these diets, they need a lot of understanding and knowledge to
    follow without consequences in the long run).... 
    When there's a huge lack of Iron the best absorbable form of Iron is (for
    many unfortunately) still in Red Meat and especially in Liver and Blood
    Sausage... Plant sources are often packed with Oxalates and Anti-Nutrients,
    which makes the Iron less absorbable.

    3. Absorption => If the Cause is in the Digestive System, you'll need to
    treat this. Think: Appendicitis Necroticans and Ulcers.

    4. Loss => If it is caused by Bleedings, find the Cause.... Think:
    Carcinoma/Myom Uteri, Carcinoma Coli (also for Colitis Ulcerosa), Stomach/
    Duodenal Ulcers....

    5. Production => Kidneys can be a Cause of Anemia because of a lack op
    Erythropoietin (EPO), but not for Iron Level in the Blood Plasm, and I
    think this is what was measured?

    I would think she got this from bleeding because she has had two
    miscarriages in the past year or so. If I end up treating her, I'll keep
    these in mind. Thank you!

Especially interesting:
"The consciousness-like coherence properties of the biophoton
field are closely related to its base in the properties of the physical vacuum
and indicate its possible role as
an interface to the non-physical realms of mind, psyche and consciousness."

    You're welcome, Cheryl
    This brings up the following question...

    Question:
    Are we working with the physical on the non-physical realm?  Or are we
    working on the non-physical on the physical realm?  
   
    This refers to Johan's comments that we need to 'treat' the physical by
    'treating' the etheric spiral.  It really seems like we are 'not' actually
    'treating' the physical but the non-physical.  And then, does the physical
    world and it's varied interventions, like vaccines or pollutants, etc.,
    change the etheric spiral, or is the etheric spiral attracting these
    events, akin to karmic traces?.  
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    July 2014 Flag
    With the Chiren we are clearly treating the non-physical realm. In this
    model we are working on the etheric body which is said to lie between the
    physical and the astral bodies.

    Changes in the physical also affect the non-physical systems because for
    example the interventions also have their own energetic signature.
    Everything is energy, the physical too...

Glasses Causing Spin Inversion?

Ingrid
August 2014 edited August 2014 in Spin Inversion & Cause Flag
Questions:
1. Is anyone familiar with the phenomenon that glasses can bring a client in a
spin inversion, because they have the effect of an antenna? 
2. If so, any idea what could be done, preferably by the clients themselves, so
that in the time in between the treatments the glasses will not have the
negative impact?

    1. I see this quite often and I usually check for this early on and ask
    that they re mediate this issue first before proceeding with a biophoton
    series. I suspect after a series of treatments they can tolerate more BUT
    in order to get fastest results with fewest sessions this is what I am
    doing now.
    2. They need to get NON METAL glasses. Here in the US CVS and Costco are 2
    stores that carry some selection.

    Glasses can indeed create a spin inversion.

    the cause can be:
    a) the metal that is in the frame OR
    b) the geometrical form of the frame. This is rare but it has occurred.

    The best solution is to buy a frame that has no metal in it as Toril
    suggested. I do not know of any good selections in the Netherlands.

    Great, thanks Johan. I mention that his gallbladder has been healed because
    I've been treating it for a while, and Tuesday the vet did an ultrasound of
    his gallbladder and it was completely empty (it hadn't been emptying
    properly before). But he has had serious gallbladder issues in the past. Is
    it strange that the high blood pressure is just showing up now, when he had
    serious gallbladder issues going back over a year, and his gallbladder
    appears healed now? Thank you so much for your asistance!!!

    The fact that the Gallbladder LOOKS good and empty does not say it IS good,
    it does not say anything about its functions.

    Blood pressure issues have 3 possible causes:
    1) Calcification
    2) Gallbladder issues
    3) Kidney issues

    If now the blood pressure shows up, it means that something is not right.
    Apart from treating the Gallbladder I would definitely also go for Kidney
    support with every treatment.

    Thank you Johan. I have also been treating his kidneys periodically, and
    always include solidago and populus with every session. Still seems
    somewhat confusing. I will continue to treat his gallbladder, kidneys and
    treat for calcification. Thanks.

Lyme, Measurement, Emotions

    Thank you Karolina, 
    I can say that my measurement has never been too much of an issue.  I
    usually don't doubt them unless I keep getting drops after a treatment and
    after a Spin Inversion has been ruled out.  

    What does present a problem and I think I'm getting more clarity on it, is
    the progress a person makes.  I have had  persons who report Lyme diagnosis
    or similar histories, severe fatigue, joint pain etc.  What I've
    experienced was a failure to see gradual improvement, but rather difficult
    times in between treatments.  

    I can now understand that I have been too focused on looking for nosodes to
    fill the empty slots, and not putting into consideration the 'starting
    point' of the patient.  So I am now being less nosode aggressive in my
    treatment of patients who present with more difficult medical histories.  

    My sense is that the first couple of treatments that entail the Hormones
    are the least difficult and need the 8 nosodes that balance these points. 
    After this I begin to work only on the Kidney and Circulation before going
    to the Small Intestine, Stomach and Lymph, etc.(unless Appendix
    Necroticans)  In the past I did not do this and it has made the
    difference.  I'm sure this is only one possible method so I'm open to other
    ways of working.  

    In some of these patients who have been plagued with long time, severe
    ailments, there is an amazing psychological component that can distort
    one's measurement.  There is a recurrent 'auric' issue that arises along
    with the emotional states of 'victim', 'cursed' and such.  Johan has
    pointed out that this can often be confused with Spin Inversion - like
    readings, if I understand him correctly.  (which is not always the case,
    hehe). I am also under the impression that severe emotions like these can
    mask the measuring. 
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    October 2015 edited October 2015 Flag
    Even if there is a severe psychological component, I have not seen it
    distort the measurements. Severe emotions do not influence the size of the
    aura. And this is the only thing that you can measure, an (almost) absence
    of the aura. Colors and activity within the aura may change, but that is
    not what you can measure.

    The absence of an aura is caused by a lack of energy in the client. This is
    usually caused by exhausted Adrenal glands. These Adrenal glands can cause
    many more things. But the symptoms you describe, are all caused by the
    Liver/Gallbladder and Kidney systems.

    If you have exhausted Adrenals or a bad Liver, there is generally a need to
    change lifestyle. But the problem is always to find the cause. If you have
    exhausted Adrenal glands, then you need to find out the cause of this. If
    people have used too much energy, they need to charge. If they do not, you
    cannot expect improvement.
    If you fix your car, it will not run if there is no more gas in the tank.
    The client needs to fill up and this might need time. I had a burn-out too
    and in spite of treatments there was no improvement. Only a few months rest
    did the job. This is the case for everyone who is exhausted.

    I do not believe that emotional factors will distort your measurements
    unless there is projection.
    I also do not need 8 slots for the Hormone glands. I need 5, sometimes 6 at
    the most and that includes Selenium and Berberis. More hormonal drops might
    show up next session, but in the first session, this is generally enough.

    Further: I always ignore the medical diagnosis. I always want to know only
    the current symptoms, the history and for the rest I have my measurements.

    Jennifer commented on this post, while it was already moved. This is her
    comment:

    Jennifer: "Out of the blue, starting one day, I was able to distinguish a
    difference in sound between the Spin Inversion and the "auric issue". I
    have found it very helpful, in fact, as I interpret it as a sign that
    emotions are playing a major issue in the client's well being that day.
    More discussion helps them to relax and it also informs the kind of
    treatment that I might give them. I also can't help thinking that as I
    continue my own spiritual healing, that my ability to treat people has
    become much more intuitive and effective. In fact, looking at and
    understanding ourselves may be one of the most important steps of all, in
    becoming an effective practitioner."

    October 2015 edited October 2015 Flag
    Jennifer:
    I found that sometimes the measuring is more difficult if I am not in a
    good condition, if I am tired or something like this. You always needs to
    look at yourself first.

    There cannot be a difference in sound, because in Spin-Inversion there also
    is an energetic/auric issue (for example no aura). In both cases the cause
    is the same: lack of strength. A Spin-Inversion also leads to a weakening/
    disappearance of the aura.

    With Ozaliet, one can help the symptom alone, which is not possible if one
    has a Spin-Inversion. There is also a difference in symptoms between the
    two conditions. I often give energy remedies to people with a
    Spin-Inversion or to those who have a lack of aura.

    The cause of the lack of strength is different. But as far as emotions
    goes, in case of a Spin-Inversion this condition always causes fatigue
    which in turn very often leads to emotional condition.
    Emotions cannot lead to different sounds in the measurement.


    On a different note:
    Intuition, as people call it, can only help if the practitioner has years
    and years of experience. But then it only appears as intuition. In fact it
    is a very fast recognition of the situation that happens.

    Spiritual growth only happens once you leave more and more dogmas and
    believe systems behind you. We all live in at least 12 dimensions, but we
    observe only three. We have to learn to expand to the 4th, 5th and 6th
    dimensions but this is only possible if you let go of a lot of the baggage
    that you have accumulated in the first three dimensions, in other words if
    you become lighter.

    "Spiritual experience" is in 99.9% of the cases a mental state in which
    illusions play a big role, in other words it can be an illusion in itself.
    (Discernment is needed)

    And if one's spiritual experience, or intuition is illusion, this can lead
    to a dangerous lack of self-reflection as seen in this quote about a
    practitioner, which is taken from an email I received from a concerned
    client.

    "I have to say that -blank- does so worry me, he speaks of his many clients
    who have been healed
    But I have yet to find one, and he does ask all the time of people to write
    a recommendation for him though some really don't know what to say.

    He told me that he works strictly to your protocol but I know this not to
    be the case. Another reason why I can never go back to him because I simply
    don't trust him.

    He told me that a large number of those who he has treated are saying they
    have a return of the symptoms he was supposed to have cleared. His
    explanation is that, when he is treating people, they get better, but as
    soon as he moves on they go down hill because he has removed his healing
    aura from them and they go down hill.

    He also claims his energy fields have a marked effect on the Chiren in that
    his thoughts can make a difference to the readings and his spirit guides
    tell him that this is because in the healing programme his personal
    influence is 70 per cent and the Chiren only 30 per cent."

    I can only say that in this case the facts tell a different story. Perfect
    guidance would give perfect and lasting effects wouldn't it? Just following
    protocol would have given far better results than all of this imagined
    personal influence.  But even in the face of proof to the contrary, the
    superiority believe is maintained. 

    Since this case does not stand alone, and seems to be a perspective/way
    that several practitioners have adopted, I thought it was necessary to
    comment about it. Biontology is so effective because it treats people with
    their own biophotons, their own light, not yours. And the assessment system
    only works well if you keep your influence out of the measurement.

    The issue has been resolved. 
    I thought she had Spin Inversion because she was exhausted when she got up.
     
    But it seems she was waking up in the night, about 2am and tossing and
    turning the rest of the night. 

    She had no drops the next time she came.  She did have symptoms of muscle
    tension in her back. One day it would be on the right side  and the nest
    day on the left. Back and forth. 
                                                             
    >12 Program:
    Adenoma Gallenblase, Cholecystitis, Billiary Cirrhosis, Cuprum repeated
    this, Calculi Billiaris, Atropinum, Chelidonium, Hepar     

    Footplates:
    Berberis, Selenium  Bact. Proteus, Bact. Pyo, Bact. Lactis, Bact. Coli.
   
    She has come back twice with 4 days inbetween, no drops, and I have
    repeated this.  
    She is having morning bowel movement everyday and sleeping better. The
    muscle in her back are much improved. 

    Question:
    1. My client plans to come a few more times. Is this an instance where I
    could put in these remedies in a Chickey and she could do this daily?  
    2. If so how often would she need to come in for measuring?  
    3. Also, why would the muscle tension in her back shift left, right every
    other day like that?

    Answers:
    1. It is advised to treat no more than once a week. Only under special
    circumstances (when people are in critical condition) Johan treats twice a
    week. 
    Every treatment, especially when you use nosodes, starts a new
    detoxification/healing process (link to Johan's comment about this) and
    will continue for 3 days after the session. After that it is good for the
    body to rest. This will add to the effectiveness of the therapy. By
    treating every day you can overburden and exhaust the body. 

    The Chikey is especially useful when clients:
    * have a tendency to go into Spin-Inversion all the time, 
    * live too far away to see you every week, 
    * have severe gallbladder/stress symptoms every day like seizures (only use
    the remedy Atropinum in a short program) 
    * need daily Dyslexia treatments. 

    There are probably more applications, but full treatments daily with a lot
    of remedies or with nosodes is not one of them. 
    In the case of your client Atropinum daily (short program!) might help
    since she clearly has Gallbladder issues.
   
    2. This is for you and your client to decide. If she measures OK and is
    really doing well, you can also leave it up to her. When she feels she
    needs more specific treatment than the Chikey cards you gave her she can
    come to you… 
    In this stage with all these Gallbladder issues still there, I would
    suggest to see her on a regular basis however.
   
    3. The muscle cramps that move from side to side are a symptom of Wood
    (Liver/Gallbladder) imbalance. 
  •

    March 2013 edited March 2013 Flag
    As these symptoms of muscle imbalance subside, and no drops, can I assume
    the Liver and Gallbladder are coming into balance?  
    I will put in Gallbladder remedies once aweek until she is symptom free, do
    I need to support Liver also, assuming no drops when I measure.

    you mention " no drops". In this case you should look for the cause of
    this. 

    Scars is a possible cause for the lack of drops, since breast surgery can
    go through multiple meridians, so yes, the scars should all be treated. 
    Sometimes scar treatments need to be done multiple times.

    Regarding the sleep issues => you should think of Gallbladder problems but
    focus is needed. Also, try to use support remedies for the meridians/organ
    systems you are working on. Support remedies should be focussed too.

March 2015 - Endorphins Blocking Results?

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Q&A Flag
Question
If endorphins block results, is it even possible to treat someone effectively
until they have completely stopped exercising?

Answer
Endorphins, or morphine for that matter, will NOT block results. The only
problem that endorphins cause is a lack of reliable information. The diagnosis
will become impossible as long as there are no drops or symptoms to work with.
So if you use self-selected remedies to treat someone with an endorphin mask,
and your guesses are right, the treatment WILL work.
But exercise and endorphins do create another problem and that is that it makes
it impossible for the client to feel what is really going on inside their
bodies. They will make statements like feeling “amazing” or “never being really
sick” but that is the illusion and then all of a sudden for example a tumor is
found that is inoperable, and one wonders “how can this be”?
When a client doesn’t really feel when he or she needs to rest, this is a
problem. Giving out too much energy WILL block treatments, but endorphins by
themselves do not diminish effectiveness of the treatment.
The only way to really start seeing the full picture of what is going on inside
the body is to stop exercising. This should at least be done for as long as the
underlying cause has not been removed.

    What if the endorphins are caused by high stress? 
    I had that with a client and giving her 2-7 standard with
    Atropinum, Plumbum and Viscum didn't help. 
    In that case should I just wait to treat her once her situation becomes
    less stressful?

    Check always if you press to hard with the probe, try measuring with less
    pressure.
    But if you think that high stress causes the endorphins, just put in all
    Gallbladder remedies

    Endorphins do not block treatment, they only make assessing rather
    difficult. So there is no need to wait with treatment.

    It was definitely the stress that caused the endorphins because I started
    measuring the client (she had drops) and we had to stop so she could answer
    call from the hospital which turned out to be long and stressful
    conversation. Right after we returned to measuring and I couldn't find a
    drop. I know that my measuring still needs lots of practice but the client
    had very easy hands so I am almost sure that the stress caused endorphins
    in her case.  

    What do you mean by saying "just put in all Gallbladder remedies" ?
    2-7 with all Gallbladder remedies to lift off  the endorphins and then
    start the treatment (that seems like too much information for the body).

    But if because of endorphins all points are straight and nothing lifts them
    up ( and by nothing I mean 2-7 with Atr., Plum. & Visc. or Gallbladder
    remedies) then I should treat based on symptoms?

    I am in the middle of creating my Web site for my practice and teaching,
    and found this pertinent information while researching. I think it's worth
    sharing with everyone - especially about "waves, particles - subjectivity
    vs. objectivity:

    Albert Einstein discovered the photon and published a scientific paper
    about it in 1905. He proposed the existence of the photon, an elementary
    particle associated with electromagnetic radiation (Light), which was the
    foundation of quantum theory. In 1909, he showed that the photon carries
    momentum as well as energy and that electromagnetic radiation must have
    both particle-like and wave-like properties if Planck's law holds; this was
    a forerunner of the principle of wave–particle duality. He would go on to
    receive the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.

    I think this helps one to understand the enormity of photons and how the
    world has changed because of Einstein's discovery. Actually, I think the
    ancient people knew about this when they wrote the Upanishads and tried to
    teach people about light. Very similar statements are made in these
    incredible manuscripts when they refer to light, prana (life force),
    energy, etc.

    I also would like to add, the new science is referring to photons as
    information carriers.  This in explained in lay terms nicely by Ervin
    Laszlo in Science and the Akashic Field (2nd ed) on pg. 66.  Understanding
    the old term for the 'matter-less' space as the vacuum, Laszlo says: "The
    vacuum turns out to be cosmic medium that transports photon-wave (light) as
    well as density-pressure waves, exerts the force that may ultimately decide
    the fate of the universe, and endows the particles we know as "matter" with
    mass."  This 'vacuum' becomes the medium for INFORMATION.  In effect,
    information (akashia) is carried on the photon.  He says, The quantum
    vacuum is the "holographic information mechanism that records the
    historical experience of matter."  Said in another way:  Energy, especially
    as photons, carries information, which is why it has an effect on
    'things'.  Thanks you Kathy.

    Love that. Thanks to you, too! I think the more research one does on the
    history of photons, one understands more what Johan is talking about when
    he tells us about how they are "information packets" (as he calls them).

Hi everyone,
I attended the last training in CT, so still learning and still "very green" 
:-)
I would love to hear your opinions about treatments you can make or add to the
protocol when someone is in pain:

- Laringitis
- Fever
- Severe Headaches/Migraines
- Food Poisoning (Vomiting/Diahrrea)
- Acute Lower Back Pain
- Joint Pains
- Gout/Uric Acid
etc.

All the best

    The only thing you can do is Measure! There is no General Protocol for
    Pain.

    Treatment of Pain depends on its Location. If you know where the Pain is
    you can assess its Cause.

    Joint Pains/Gout/Arthritis are generally caused by the Kidneys/Adrenal
    Glands

    Migraines by the Gallbladder/Stomach

    Vomiting/Diarrhea often is caused by Foodpoisoning, but it might also be
    Whiplash / Appendicitis

    Fever can be caused by anything, but Higher Body Temparature is not always
    Fever

    Lower Back Pain could be caused by Circulation Issues, or could be caused
    by Different Length in Legs, which in general is caused by Different
    Tension in the Legs. This tension difference is caused by the Gallbladder
    System.

    Laryngitis is generally a Tonsillitis or Chronic Tonsillitis, which cane be
    caused by Foodpoisoning or a Strep or Staph Infection

    Yes, I am following the protocol and proceeding accordingly.
    The main reason for this question was because we live in a society that
    "demands" results, and sometimes the easing of these symptomatologies grows
    the awereness and respect for what we are doing 
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    Symptom relief will be biggest if you have a good Assessment and Order of
    Treatment in your Sessions. This way you'll assist the body best in
    Healing. 
    Symptoms are an Expression of an Underlying Cause, so trying to address
    them directly without paying attention to this Causal Imbalance is a
    mistake in thinking and will have less results. 

    Biontology fortunately shows remarkably fast results in most cases, so I
    don't think you have to be too worried about not living up to "Society's
    demands". There will always be clients who don't have the desired results
    of course, but they won't get those with a Recipe either...

Thrombose and or other Connections?

Beate
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag

Johan has mentioned the connection with Thrombocytes and Gallbladder two times
lately on the forum now, which I will never forget.

Question: Is there a connection with the Thrombose and these Symptoms? 
Stiffness of Fingers and Knacking Sound when bending them?
Tiredness 
Tingeling in Fingers and toes 
Change of quality Feces - from light grey to black within weeks, as well as
consistence
Stomach pain left side (will measure Appendicitisses next time) 
Knife Like Pain abdomen right side?

I will make a new measurement tomorrow and definitely look into the
Gallbladder, Circulation and the Intestines.

    Hi Beate,
     
    Stiffness and Tingling is a Circulatory problem.
   
    The Knacking sound is believed to come from Gas that escapes from the fluid
    pouch in between bones. If it happens all the time it can be an indication
    for Arthritis or a lack of Synovial Fluid. 
   
    Lack of fluid in the Joints (knacking sound) and lack of fluid in the Blood
    (thick Blood => Thrombosis) seems to be a pattern..... Since you probably
    drink enough water being a Biontologist, there must be another Cause for
    the lack of Fluid in the Blood. 
    Protein is needed to attract water into the Blood Vessels and into the
    Synovial Fluid. So the Liver, which produces Albumin and other Blood
    Proteins might be the Cause (consistent with Clay Colored Feaces). But it
    might also be a disfunction of the Kidneys, which leads to the excretion of
    Protein in the Urine (Albuminuria). 
    Another probable influence might be Adrenal Fatigue, since this can cause
    you to excrete too much water so dehydration can occur even when there's
    enough fluid intake...
   
    The Gastro-Intestinal problems worry me a bit... Black Faeces can be caused
    by bleeding somewhere up the GI tract and the Stabbing Pains are Symptom of
    Inflammation. I would look for Carcinoma Coli (good for Ulcerative Colitis)
    and of course the Appendiciteses...

     Hi Karolina,
    Thank you very, very much :)

    The urine seems fine and no smell as long as enough fluid.
    The history of TIA,  and other things I feel that has been treated by
    Chiren.
    I am turning 61 years now, and there might be natural that things surface
    now....that is good.
    But what you say, it also worries me a bit. Tomorrow I will measure and see
    what happens.

    Thrombose story continues: This night at about 3 AM, a wakeup call from my
    Gallbladder. Lying in bed on my left side I wake up with Genital inside
    cramps, and Pressure in the Thrombose area, Anus area. Very painful I can
    promise you. 
    Then I heard the voice of Johan laughing and saying....."yes and which
    meridian runs there....the Gallbladder hahah...:) " He has mentioned this
    on the forum lately in another case.
    Suddenly I got stronger cramps. I have had these for years, but now the
    cramps was followed by sticking pain,
    very quickly on the Gallbladder meridian on the right toe. WOW folks, then
    I really woke up ....
    I did as I usually do when the cramps come, I squat for a few minutes on
    the floor and the cramp let go a bit.

    I had planned measurement and treatment today, and I have now just finished
    treatments, it is 5.30 AM. I have used the advices I got from Karolina in
    this discussion as well as information from several talks on the forum.

    Measurement:
    Gallbladder points - all drop, no surprise there!
    Triple Warmer - no drops
    Bladder, Kidney, Liver and Panceras -  "soso medium OK"
    Nervous system - OK

    Treatment >12 Year Program:
    Adenomyose Gallenblase, Carc Coli, Injeel Chol, Billary Chirrosos,
    Cholecystitis, Chronic Appendicitis (strange but I measured), Atropinum,
    Appendicitis Necroticans

    Footplates:
    Chelidonium, Bact Proteus, Bact Dysenteria,Solidago, Selenium, Belladonna,
    Duodendheel, Anacardium

    2-7 Years Program:
    Aesculus, Arnica, Galium, Coenzyme, Circolo

    Control measurement:
    Main concern Gallbladder green light....so far!

    I have taken Nux Vomica and Berberris orally the last few days, and will
    with Lymphmyosot in a few days.

    Yes Karolina I think you are right, this is a bit serious. However I feel
    happy now, since I am finally on the right track.
    (Do not know if you remember the friend I wrote about on the forum with on
    off bladder, she comes today to stay with me in Spain...hmhm...)

    Anyway, I have a few questions that might look silly, but here they come:)

    Questions:
    1. I this case, can I treat myself after 3 days ?
    2. Does the light always have to be on the left side, or is it useful after
    several treatments to make a change?
    3. Can one use the lighthandles internally, or is that just a rubbish
    thought?


    PS I think this is interesting: Adenomyosis from Wikipedia

    - Do a Treatment after 4 days of not Treating.
    - The Light Rod is more effective if it is on the left side, this is the

    - I don't see any extra benefit from using the rods "internally"

Brain Damage from Birth

slevarekslevarek
November 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
"Boy" (30 yrs) with brain damage after birth.

Medication/drugs:
NEVER had vaccines
No medications whatsoever.
Homeopathy => tried, but no results.. 

Symptoms:
Brain functions on the level of a a 3-4 year old
Sweet like a child would be. 
Outbursts of anger, frustrations comes out of nowhere
Damages himself and objects (furniture)
Sensitivities to pesticides/chemicals (when leaving the house to go out) => 
triggers him to get a bit crazy.. 
Over weight => you can see when you look into his eyes he is this being so
caught in that body.. 
Eyes are gentle and he is full of love.

Question:
1. What can I give this "boy".. that would /might help him to cope better.. 
 
Parents:
Are exhausted and frustrated.. but love him dearly.
They truly need sessions, especially the mother.. she is at her wits end, but
would do anything to make it all better for her son.
Treating the parents is next. 

Sessions:
I try not to make sessions too long. 
But he does sit patiently while I measure.. no problem with that.. 
And he does talk somewhat.. repeating words I say

I have measured and treated Aluminum and Mercury
I found bacteria and Salmonella on the Intestine Meridian.

Results:
Sleeps much better since we began.. .

Question:
2. Anyone out there worked with such a situation before.. What results have you
gotten.. or what do you suggest.. I am open.

    For a good assessment knowing your measurements and more about the the
    brain damage itself and the background is needed... 

    1. What kind of brain damage? Developmental? Because of a secondary event?
    Physical/chemical damage? etc.
    2. Why did the brain damage occur? What happened during or after birth?
    3. What situation was the mother in during pregnancy?
   
    General suggestions:
    * Treating the mother would be a first. This way you can find out more
    about the condition the child has been exposed to during pregnancy. 
    * Whiplash and Spin Inversion treatment might be needed. Most people with
    chemical sensitivity are in Spin Inversion.
    * Anger outburst indicate Liver/Gallbladder, but what are the causes of
    those things?

    Additional information

    Client History:
    Premature birth => transfered to incubator => problem with breathing =>
    lack of oxygen to the brain.
    However, developmental problems were not noticed until he was 3-4 years old
    (that's when it became obvious)
   
    Personality of client:
    Sweet teddy bear type of child.. large.. he can talk somewhat.. repeats
    what we say.. looks at us a laughs.. .. sometimes he just is in his own
    world talking away mumbling.

    Parents' observation:
    When he has issues such as hitting furniture.. they believe it  is in
    reaction to some chemical sensitivity from insecticide sprays in  their
    area.. that is what they say. 

    My observation:
    I am certain.. the child picks up on the mothers emotional stress and acts
    out. 
    I know the mother is the main issue. First thing she says.. "you know it
    was the doctor in the hospital.. we are Jewish, and the doctor was Muslim..
    AND this was 30 years ago.. The mother told me she feels so much guilt,
    sadness, anger.. 
    I have requested the mother to allow me to treat her, but she would not
    allow me to give her a session.. her son first.. 

    Measurements and treatment:
    Whiplash
    Spin Inversion => first 2 sessions (not needed the 3rd session)

    Salmonella and other bacteria
    Not many toxins, some on the Nervous System

    NO drops on the Liver nor the Gallbladder. as well on the Bladder, no
    drops.. 

    Results:
    Sleeping much better
    3rd session, no more drops

    To me it was amazing he didn't have more health issues.
    However, he never had vaccines, has a clean way of living, eating.. etc.  
    He can sit quietly through the session easily.

    So now my goal will be to get the mother a session in a week or so..  

    Question:
    They want me to work on anything I can for the brain.. 
    So if you have any suggestions.. let me know.

    Questions/Remarks:

    1. I still feel something is missing in your answer. The assumption of the
    medical doctors is that oxygen deprivation caused brain damage. But what
    was objectively visible inside the brain?
    If a lack of oxygen right after birth would have caused brain damage, it
    should have been observed far earlier than 3-4 years after the fact...

    2. The behaviour of the child indicates serious Liver/Gallbladder
    problems. 
    That you measure no drops indicates Endorphins, which means a lot of stress
    (chemical, energetic, emotional...), probably also on other systems. 
   
    3. My advise to treat the mother was because of a search for the cause. I
     want to know to what kind of Toxins the mother has been exposed during
    pregnancy.

    4. What Toxins did you measure on the Nervous System?
   
    5. Does the mother ever talk to the child or to her husband about the
    traumas she experienced in her life? 

    6. Was the development of the child normal during the first years? 
   
    7. If so, what happened in the 6 months before it became "obvious" that
    something was wrong?

    8. If a child has problems with breathing, this does not necessarily mean
    that the brain gets insufficient oxygen.
    (it is another important indication for Whiplash though)

    9. I would definitely dig further into the real issues with the guy.. 
    There should at least be attention to the Gallbladder (nosodes!)

    This is really a big problem that needs to be resolved somehow. 

    For a company with so many contacts it is impossible to e-mail everyone
    individually and that is why we use the e-mail program ConstantContact. For
    some reason e-mails sent from this program are often perceived as spam.
    Different mail and computer settings will cause varying results in your
    ability to receive our e-mails. 

    For anyone who receives e-mail sometimes, but not always, the issue cannot
    be a problem with our database and thus it is difficult to resolve from our
    side. The problem is most likely caused by safety-settings.

    A temporary solution can be for us to announce everything that is announced
    by e-mail on the forum too. But I prefer to find another solution of
    course. Attachments need to be sent out by e-mail and cannot be posted on
    the forum.

    I have googled for problems with receiving e-mail from ConstantContact and
    here are some tips.

    Here is another link with people sharing about the same issue, so you can
    get a better understanding. It is very important to add us to your "safe
    sender list" like Diane wrote in the last e-mail.

    Another thing I may do is announce every e-mail on the forum, so if someone
    does not receive it they can notify us. 
    If someone has suggestions to solve this problem we are of course open to
    it. We have been struggling with the issue for quite some time now.

    The Internet provider can also be the problem it seems, in the following

    Did you measure the Skin points?

    Apart from dehydration of the Skin caused by problems already mentioned by
    Richard, there could also be Cell Phone Radiation or other forms of
    Radiation. 
    There could also be a Staph or Strep infection. 

    But you can measure these things. What does the measurement tell you?

    With questions like this it is almost impossible to give an answer because
    no information is made available to us.

    I had a client witih extreme itching on the legs, particularly after a
    shower.  We couldn't find anything particular on his readings as he had
    very few disturbances once we corrected his vaccinations and a few other
    points in the first session.
     We both did a lot of research, as his itching was nearly driving him out
    of his mind, and and once he cut sulfates out of his life ( shampoo, dish
    soap, laundry soap ... look, it is in so many things! ) the itching
    stopped.  Sulfates have been around for generations, but even more so now.
     Maybe thats what bothered his dad too?
    Just a thought.

    That means that your client has an Allergy to Sulphates. You can of course
    tell him to stop using products with Sulphates. But what is next? 

    I would try to find the Cause of his sensitivity so he doesn't need to be
    that careful anymore (freedom!). He than can choose to use less chemicals,
    which is always good, but then it is by choice and not due to an underlying
    problem… When there's one sensitivity, there are usually more.

    Yes, I it makes sense.  I think it's one of those question that come out of
    fatigue.  All drugs in some way 'replace' the body's function, therefore
    the measurements are going to be skewed from the basic, drugless condition
    of the person.

    SSRI's do not cause endorphin mask, but like all other medication will
    throw of the normal balance and regulation of the body. This may or may not
    reflect in your measurement, but not as an endorphin mask. 

    The SSRI's block normal processes in the body. They are primarily used as
    anti-depressants, but in reality they are suppressants. 

    The main problem with these drugs is that when people do not feel their
    body as it is, they will continue their lifestyle.This causes the situation
    to get worse. At one point no medicine in the world will work anymore and
    then the only solution is to stop doing everything. 
   
    One cannot ignore the body forever, it will not allow it. Continuing to
    spend more energy than is available will force the body to stop this. 
    Lifestyle is a very important causal factor in illness.

Technical Issue => Chiren Does Not Measure

Cyoung
September 2014 edited September 2014 in Chiren Flag
My chiren has suddenly stopped being able to measure, although I am still able
to log in and run programs.

I tried swapping out cables for the gold electrode without success. Also,
referred to the recent chiren manual instructions to test using the System
Setup menu, but my chiren model does not include the "Service" button leading
to the "Test Systems" and "Test EEPROM" buttons.

I also noticed when I turn the device off, the chiren briefly displays the line
"Route:_____No Such Device". Not sure what this means or if it has any relation
to what is happening.

Recently, I installed the update supplied by IABS and confirmed the chiren was
updated to version 1.0.

    Hi Candace,

    There may be a problem with the cable of the measuring probe. Is there
    anyone near you that you can borrow the probe -or more specifically the
    wire of the probe- from? 

    About the line "Route:_____No Such Device"
    The Chiren always starts up with this line. This is because the Chiren used
    to have a printer that was discontinued due to lack of interest. In the
    boot up, the Chiren still looks if the printer is connected, but this has
    no consequences for its functioning.

    When the probe cable is the culprit, this is easy to solve as you only need
    to order a new one. Let me know how it went or if you need further
    assistance.

    Hi Stefano,

    The Chiren is a computer and just like other computers once in a while it
    can get stuck and needs to be rebooted. We don't have a button for this, so
    what you did is the only solution. There is no harm in it.

Ehrlichiosis and Kidney Function

Barbaralee
November 2013 edited January 2014 in Questions for the H.A.A. Flag
I mentioned Ehrlichiosis family of pathogens to Johan last weekend during the
energetic anatomy class. He said that he'd never heard of it. Perhaps it is a
North American disease. 

Irregardless, I feel it would be important to add to our collection. 
I respectfully request that you consider the following:

Human Ehrilichiosis: 
=> Caused by rickettsial bacteria
=> Transmitted in part by the same ticks that carry Lyme disease. 
=> 2 forms: Granulocytic (caused by Anaplasma phagocytophila) and Monocytic
(caused by Ehrlicia chaffeensis)

=> Settles in the Kidneys, and causes Kidney failure. 
=> Places an enormous strain on the Kidneys (protein in urine, white blood
cells etc) 
=> Negative cultures for infection more than likely have this bacteria in their
system. 
=> Seriously impact our animal friends (dogs/cats/horses), and as many of us
treat such beings, we could use this remedy here too.

=> Medical treatment for the disease is Doxycyclene. 
=> My blood is positive for the e. chaffeensis.
=> My blood serum levels remain positive for active infection, despite intense
treatment for this disease. I suspect that I am the norm.

We in the Biontology community know the high importance of good Kidney
function. Placed between the Hormonal System and Circulation on our protocol
list, our clients must have good Kidney performance in order to move into
better health.

We have Populus Compositum (used for protein in the urine), but that a Support
not a Nosode.

Thank you very much for your consideration to my request.

    Hi Barbara,
   
    The whole idea of Biontology is not to "fire at the bug", but to "treat the
    terrain". Just like in clients with Lyme it is not necessarily the Lyme
    Nosode that creates the best results in treatment, there will most likely
    also be other remedies than Ehrilichiosis Nosode that can help with this
    infection just as well or even better. 
    Johan never knows what exact infections he has encountered, because it is
    of non-importance for Biontology. He only knows what he has measured and
    what worked. The symptoms (which vary greatly in each individual with the
    same infection) are most important. 
    Usually Nosodes of bacteria giving similar symptoms will do the trick =
    homeopathic principle of "curing like with like". Since Febris Wolhynica is
    also a rickettsial bacteria, this remedy might for example match in
    Ehrlichiosis, but symptom wise (Kidney infection/failure) Leptospirose
    might match too... Leusinum is yet another option.

    Johan started out with many nosodes and reduced them to the most effective
    ones. This is why only remedies with a proven and needed added value will
    become part of the Chiren. One of the major ideas of Biontology is "less is
    more"... this is also the case for the number of remedies in the Chiren. 
    Too many remedies will distract from treating the cause. It is often
    forgotten that the remedies are merely assisting the Biophoton Treatment,
    they speed up the process. But balancing the body's own light is at the
    core of Biontology. That is why, even if one doesn't understand anything of
    Biontology, random treatment will give improvement anyway. The results
    clients have with simple Chikey cards, but sometimes even without them.
    prove this.
    Getting to the root of an issue an pulling it out, so no more treatments
    are necessary anymore, is the challenge for us Biontologists. For this we
    need nosodes, but not necessarily an exact copy of the "intruder" we think
    is causal. Bacteria, Viruses, Fungi, Parasites.... they are all
    opportunistic, and can only create symptoms in a weakened system.

    For example:
    Candida is never the nosode that will help get rid of this condition
    (candida)...
    Cancer nosodes will never heal cancer, they are only instrumental as part
    of the treatment
    Brucella Abortus Bang works better for certain Lyme symptoms than the Lyme
    Nosode itself.

    Most important about infectious disease of any kind is to look at the cause
    of immune-deficiency which is the underlying cause of the symptoms the
    infection creates. Usually people with severe reactions to the kind of
    infections you are referring to (tick borne disease) are in a state of
    sympathetic over activation due to prolonged stress (often caused by abuse
    and neglect, but it might have other emotional, energetic (e.g. radiation)
    or physical causes too).

    Because of this finding, we are experimenting with a remedy that might be
    more relaxing than Atropinum and might help with sympathetic over
    activation. To be absolutely sure about the effectiveness of this remedy,
    we need to test it more. But my own experiences using this remedy without
    other remedies are very promising.

    I agree, and like to add:

    When there are symptoms and bacteria or viruses are found at the same time,
    this does not mean that there is a correlation. These symptoms can be
    caused by something else than the bacteria or viruses that are found. You
    have to look for a third, common factor that causes both.

    In the eighties an " AIDS" virus was found. Many virologists claimed that
    there could not be such a virus. My own investigation proved this also
    true. Now even the "inventor" of the AIDS virus, Dr. Gallo, even confirms
    that it was all a lie.
    What it proved to be was a serious increase in toxic load because of other
    reasons.

    Personally I am more inclined to research radiation as a link to Lyme
    symptoms.

    Looking at common factors: in the eighties when Aids and Lyme started to
    show up, the cell phone towers were built. At this time also cancer
    suddenly made big leaps.

    A theory I have is that increased sensitivity to radiation may be due to
    heavy metals.  The metals could function as antenna inside the body. But
    more research is needed.

Pre-eclampsia

EsterReitsma
January 2015 edited February 2015 in General Questions Flag
Client: 
31 year old female
I started treating this client 1,5 year ago now. 

Previous treatment results:
No complaints anymore since february last year. 

Current situation:
Pregnant since May => all went well but a few weeks ago 
I heard she was in the hospital due to pre-eclampsia (LINK). 
I wasn't able to measure her. 

Question:
Does anybody now the cause of pre-eclampsia and what remedies and supports we
can use for this condition? 

Any insight would be very helpful! Thank you!

    Hi Ester,

    Pre-eclampsia is a serious condition in pregnancy that presents with
    elevated blood pressure, headaches, protein in the urine and potential
    kidney damage. The cause is unknown. The only treatment is to deliver the
    baby as soon as possible. If the baby is preterm, they will hospitalize the
    mother, keep her on bedrest and watch clinical symptoms closely to allow
    the fetus to mature. It is a very serious condition that can kill the
    mother and baby. The mother is not "safe" until weeks after childbirth.

    I was a labor and delivery nurse for 8 years. I have cared for many women
    with this condition and have seen some fatalities. Personally, I would not
    attempt to treat any woman that is pregnant with this or any other
    condition. I don't know the effect of the Chiren on the fetus. Remember,
    you would be treating 2 people with the fetus being very tiny and exposing
    it to longer treatments. And you cannot treat without first measuring.

    This is a time when treatment is best left to healthcare professionals. We
    cannot treat everything with the Chiren. I would welcome a comment from
    Johan and his experience.

    Many years ago (1983) my wife at the time had this same problem and I have
    just treated.

    The main problem appeared to be Spin Inversion. After that I treated with
    Kidney Support (Albumoheel, Solidago, etc) and Gallbladder Remedies. Of
    course you need to measure which remedies match on these systems.

    My wife took a lot of rest, and when not resting she took things very
    quietly.
    The problem was away after two weeks but we decided to take things easily
    the rest of the term which was 6 months.

Stopping Proton Pump Inhibitor - Likely Duration of Treatment?

TorilJelterTorilJelter
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Medication Flag
59 year male wants biophoton treatment for heartburn. He has recently stopped
taking a proton pump inhibitor (Dexilant)

May I start treating right away? Since this medication has been telling his
body not to excrete stomach acid could it take longer to treat him even after

stopping the medication?

I found Spin Inversion / Whiplash and treated his Scars then a 10 minute
standard program with various remedies and Dyslexia with support. At the end
all drops were resolved. The next day he had very bad acid stomach / heartburn
(2 days after stopping medication- perhaps a rebound effect of stopping 
medication?)

    Hi Toril, 

    When medication is stopped you can start treating right away, and the
    returning or the heartburn shows the effect of the proton pump inhibitor is
    already gone or at least diminishing. Without production of stomach acid
    there won't be any heartburn.... 
    So I wouldn't worry about needing more treatments because of this. 

    It makes sense that after stopping the medication the heartburn starts
    again, because the cause is still there. Usually this is a combination of
    Gallbladder problems with Ulcers. This condition won't be healed in just
    one treatment and it might be helpful for your client to temporarily take
    some acid neutralisers instead of the PPI's. If the damaged stomach/
    oesophagus/duodenum lining is exposed to acid all the time it will take
    longer to heal. But be aware that when you neutralise stomach acid, protein
    is not digested effectively so she might want to limit protein intake for a
    while. 
   
    A note on your question: could you please give more information? This case
    presentation doesn't allow any insight in the client's overall condition,
    your measurements, the remedies you chose or anything you did...

    1st Session: 

    Client: 59 year old male with heartburn, stopped Dexilant 2/28 heartburn
    got worse, prior to starting medicine had esophageal spasms couldn't
    swallow food. Scar on neck from Basal cell cancer surgery and on a finger
    from glass cut.

    Measurement:

    All 6 Spin Inversion points dropped:  Spin Inversion program X 4 with fresh
    blood (one didn't work so I did 3 more)
    Pituitary & upper Circulation point not dropping anymore 

    Para-Thyroid and Thyroid dropped: Whiplash Treatment (corrected both
    points) 

    Should have measured all before and after Whiplash program to see total
    effect of his energetic whiplash.

    Scars treated energetically with glass rods. 

    I remeasured hands and feet. No drops. (Is this odd?)

    2-7 program:
    Ozaliet, Electro Essence, Ignatia, Space Clearing

    Footplate treatment: 
    Atropinum, Selenium, Berberis, Thalamus, Cerebrum, Viscum, Tonico,
    Causticum

    His watch did not provoke Spin-Inversion. I've had one child go into Spin
    Inversion from his brand new watch  :(

    2nd Session (yesterday) 

    Measurement: 
    Spin-Inversion again: Spin Inversion program 9 times (fresh blood), but no
    improvement
    I will try again soon. What is the maximum number of times to do
    Spin-Inversion program?

    I saw a therapist check for hole in aura (highest points Small Intestines
    left hand then do Grey Spider Orchid, Green Spider Orchid and Mintbush on
    the 2-7 program to improve terrain followed by another 2-7 program with
    Ozaliet, Electro Essence, Angelsword to close aura. 
    Should I have done this?

    I'm also behind on reading posts, I apologize if I'm repeating something
    then just tell me which post to read.

    Hi

    It is very strange that the Spin Inversion treatment needed to be repeated
    9 times. The most I have ever needed was two and that seems far more
    logical.

    So it seems that there were other issues in stead of the Spin Inversion
    that made the points drop. You could look at Staph or Strep and remedies
    like Aurumheel and Barijodeel, and forget about the Spin Inversion
    treatment if the points do not improve after running it two times.

    Even when the points do not drop anymore after a Whiplash treatment, you
    must still use Anti-Tetanus and Polio for the Parathyroid and Pituitary.
    Because this is always an issue, unless people are vaccinated! And then you
    have to focus on the symptoms since your measurements don't fit the
    symptoms and you can't rely on them in this instance.

    As I have written in comments on this forum a few times, It is wise to NOT
    use  Bach and Bush as these remedies mask and do not solve anything,
    especially the first couple of treatments. Nosodes and other support
    remedies are far more effective than the Bush and Bach.

    A hole in the aura is always fixed by using FRINGED VIOLET. That is the
    only remedy that you need. But only if the point drops sharply. 
    But again: the two points that are indicated for the hole could also drop
    due to food poisoning. It all depends on the drop.You need to consider a
    hole only if nothing else matches and both points (upper Large and Small
    Intestines point on the left hand) drop sharply.

    If you have no drops at all, please question your measuring.

    Heartburn is caused by the Gallbladder system. You must treat this
    simultaneously when taking people of the anti-acid systems. 
    So in this case: You treat the Hormonal System, and then only the
    Gallbladder System to avoid the serious reactions of the patient.

    March 2013 edited March 2013 Flag
    Janet,

    The hole in the aura that is referred to is a hole at the level of the
    Solar Plexus, this can be measured when on both the Large Intestine
    meridian and the Small Intestine meridian the upper (proximal) points both
    drop steeply. If Fringed Violet matches this confirms there is indeed a
    hole.

    Beate,

    It is not so much that you're "not meant to" run the Bush and Bach in the >
    12 Program, it is just that you don't profit from the whole duration of
    this program. Bush and Bach remedies are likely to travel on the higher
    frequencies of light and thus their information will only come through in
    the final step of the five-step-program of the adult treatment. 
    So it is a waste of space (and time) to put the Bush and Bach in the >12
    Program.  
    The Footplate Treatment and the 2-7 Program have no filter so all
    information comes through at the same time.

    Triple Warmer (right): Thyroid, Thymus, Insulin

    Whiplash Treatment: balanced Thyroid and Parathyroid and Pituitary
    1) I will do Polio & Anti-Tetanus next visit as you advised Johan IF still
    dropping OR irregardless?  
    Circulation (right) - Leg veins, Arm veins
    Large Intestine (right) - Appendicitis Necroticans (resolved all drops
    except nail point), Salmonella Typhi
    Small Intestine (left) Appendicitis + Duodenitis (resolved all drops) 
    Small Intestine (right) - All points but Vena Mesenterica Superior -
    Brucella Abortus Bang (resolved 3 drops)
    Heart (right) - 3 middle point - Circulo, Cranolin, Cholesterinum
    Nervous System (left) - Cervical & Thoracic spinal marrow
    Nervous system (right) - Cervical & thoracic spinal marrow + Meninges
    Lymphatic (right) - Ear point

    2) NO Gall bladder drops YET???

    Stomach meridian (right) - 3 points closest to nail
    No other drops on feet at this time.

    Treatment - Standard  >12 Program: 
    Appendicitis Necroticans, Appendicitis, Duodenitis, Salmonella Typhi,
    Brucella Abortus Bang, Circulo, Cralonin, Cholesterinum

    Footplate Support - Dyslexia Program
    Nux Vomica, Mucosa, Selenium, Aesculus, Cerebrum, Viscum, Thalamus

    All balanced at end. Kidneys OK

    Few days later Heartburn seems to be subsiding somewhat (also some dietary
    changes less alcohol, less coffee, earlier dinner )

    Will give Gallbladder special attention next visit.

    A Whiplash treatment doesn't usually correct the Pituitary gland. 

    ALWAYS treat the Triple Warmer with Anti-tetanus and Poliomyelitis,
    regardless whether you measure it or not. (Unless you know for sure there
    was no vaccination. If there was a vaccination, there is no way that it
    doesn't cause the Parathyroid and Pituitary to drop in the first session.
    Endorphins might hide the drops though.)

    What remedy corrected the Thymus and Insulin points? If you followed the
    protocol this would have come first...

    It is interesting that the Appendicitis nosodes balanced all points, except
    the Appendix point !!! This is curious.

    Heartburn is always a Gallbladder problem

    Why did you use these 3 remedies on the Heart? Strep and Staph in 99% of
    the time will match.

    What did you measure after the Hand Treatment? The support you chose
    doesn't really reflect the issues of Heartburn and Headache. (Gallbladder
    and Stomach)

    Why Cerebrum, Thalamus and Viscum? To use all three on the footplate
    treatment is a misconception I thought I had dealt with at the Refresher
    course. You only have to do this in case of real Dyslexia Treatment.
    You rather use this space to support the organ systems you focus your
    treatment on. In this case Gallbladder!, Stomach and Duodenum.

    I thought protocoll said measure everything, but I can put in Anti-Tetanus
    and Poliomyelitis regardless as this client is vaccinated? 
    So even if the Triple Warmer doesn't drop you want Anti-Tetanus and
    Poliomyelitis in...is this what you do? Or are you thinking I might be
    measuring wrong and that is why you are making this recommendation?

    Sorry I don't recall now what balanced the Thymus and Insulin points.
    sometimes if the Triple Warmer solutions don't work I go to the next step
    Circulation then Intestines and when I check the Triple Warmer it is
    balanced that makes it hard to know exactly what balanced those points.

    I used those 3 remedies on Heart because they come first on the list in the
    Chiren and they balanced the drops. Perhaps Strep and Staph should be
    placed first on the Heart list in the chiren under Photon Highways?

    I measured no drops after the hand treatment.

    I chose Cerebrum, Viscum, Thalamus because somehow I thought it would hold
    the Triple Warmer and maybe prevent Spin Inversion.

    It is very hard to put in gallbladder support when it isn't dropping and we
    have been taught to measure everything.

    Thanks for your feedback Johan.

    I will put in Gallbladder/ Stomach/ Duodenum support even if I find no
    drops on Gallbladder and see what happens if the heartburn persists.

    Hi Toril,
   
    I understand the confusion, and thank you for engaging in this learning
    process so we can explain more clearly how to work.
   
    Yes you always have to measure everything, but you also have to consider
    the symptoms/background of the client and whether these match the
    measurements. If you see that your measurement doesn't make sense, you can
    use remedies that you know for sure should show up. 
    (This is tricky because you might start projecting... But with some
    conditions and remedies Johan just knows. If he comments by saying you
    should measure ...this or that remedy/organ... under these circumstances,
    this is because in his extended experience he found this correlation to be
    (almost) a 100% true. He wouldn't write this if it were for example true in
    only 60% of the cases.)

    When someone has been vaccinated for Anti-Tetanus and Poliomyelitis, this
    is what always shows up in the first session according to Johan's and my
    own experience. (unless you have to deal with an Endorphin Mask first)
    So I suspect there is a measurement problem since you've asked.. Not
    everybody is as easy to measure unfortunately... Don't worry about it and
    practice, practice, practice... at one point even more difficult clients
    will become easier to measure, although there will always be those clients
    that are impossible to measure. 

    The list in the Chiren has to be changed (it is incomplete and in the wrong
    order), the new measurement protocol is the order that you should follow.
    Nosodes always come before anything else. Also the Triple Warmer has to be
    corrected before anything else. 90% (maybe even more) of the time following
    the measurement protocol will be sufficient to find remedies that match. 

    Cerebrum, Thalamus and Viscum are not remedies that specifically help to
    prevent Spin-Inversion. For this the overall condition/energy of the body
    and aura has to improve. 
    Energy remedies and Ozaliet can be supportive in this, most important is to
    treat the cause of the weakness.

    Thank you again for posting your cases and questions.

    Should we not use Thalamus, Viscum and Cerebrum the first session on people
    that don't have dyslexia?

    It is not necessary, but you can do this according to the imbalances you
    measure. In the first session often the higher Hormonal Glands all drop,
    and Viscum, Thalamus and Cerebrum can be good support for them. I would
    only do this if there are enough empty spots left after you corrected the
    rest and supported the main issues.

    heart attack when you read this Johan :) If you read it.

    At end all was balanced.

    Hi Toril,

    Good that you haven't lost your humour yet! ;-)

    When you have so many points dropping and especially almost all Intestinal
    points this is a big indication for Appendicitis Necroticans. Did you look
    for that?

    Since you now focussed on the Hormonal System and dealt with the "big
    disturbers" Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus, the next time you might want to
    look what the Gallbladder nosodes (Billiary Cirrhosis, Cholecystitis,
    Calculi Bil, Adenomyose Gallenblase) when you put them in for measurement
    even if the Gallbladder is not dropping. You can observe what these
    remedies do to all other dropping points.

    When you tried to find a solution for the Insulin points, did you test
    Gallbladder nosodes? Because sometimes you can find them matching there
    too. 

    Did you find a cause in your client's lifestyle/environment for the Spin
    Inversion to be there again? When a Spin Inversion shows up every time this
    is problematic, since all healing will stop when someone is in Spin.

    Realising when things are strange is very important so you can make a
    better assessment.  

    The eye-headache is a Stomach problem, which might also come from the
    Gallbladder overreacting on the Stomach. Often Gallbladder problems cause
    Inflammation/Ulceration in the Duodenum and Stomach, so you might try those
    nosodes too next time.

    Onto the next step in treatment.

    Karolina,

    I think I checked Appendicitis X3 and Tonsillitis X3 since there were so
    many drops. But sometimes it's hard to remember everything I did a few days
    later.

    Client works in media surrounded by computers 12 hours a day. I'm going to
    check him more frequently a few times just for Spin Inversion to try to
    find out the trigger. His watch does not cause spin when I tested it but
    once I went into Spin Inversion from my watch so I don't wear it anymore.

    This client is probably a good Chikey candidate but right now I don't think
    he wants to treat himself daily.

    He has been diagnosed with Ulcerations in his Esophagus. I will try
    Gallbladder remedies on any and all drops next time to see what happens
    even if the Gallbladder is not dropping. This is an interesting case for me
    because I am not used to working like this without measuring but I
    appreciate being taught new tricks.

    Hi Toril,

    I recently treated a woman who had 2 treatments with another practitioner
    before I saw her, (so the vaccines had been addressed already.)  When I
    measured her she had no drops on her Gallbladder.  But from my interview
    with her I knew she was a Gallbladder lady...lots of stress in her life.  

    I gave her a 2-7 program of Atropinum, Spascupreel, Gelsemium and Placenta
    and ran it twice.  Then I remeasured and points on the Gallbladder started
    dropping. 

    I think sometimes the body needs a little relief before it will show all
    it's problems to us.  It's almost like the organ is so taxed, so
    overworked, it's so busy taking care of business it can not and will not do
    one more thing...show a drop. So we give it a little help, a little
    assistance--kind of like hiring a secretary. The secretary doesn't do the
    work the employer is specifically trained to do, but does the smaller tasks
    that take time away from the employer doing the work she is trained to do.
    The secretary takes the edge off and gives some relief so that the employer
    can think and breathe again.  

    I think that is what a short program of support remedies will do.  They
    won't heal the problem but they will allow the organ enough relief to show
    us what is going on so that then we can come in and treat with the heavy
    hitters, the nosodes. [If after the short program, the Gallbladder was
    still not dropping, I would have used Gallbladder nosodes because I was so
    sure she had gallbladder issues.]

    I don't think of it as the body lying, I think of it like the body is so
    over taxed it can't do one more thing.  That is why it is so important to
    listen to the client.  Their symptoms will guide us so that we can give the
    body enough relief, so that the body can then talk to us directly, by
    showing us accurate drops. 

    For a Gallbladder that doesn't show, sometimes one or both Insulin points
    will drop.  In that case I try Gallbladder remedies and/or nosodes to
    balance that point. Sometimes that is enough to help the Gallbladder begin
    to show.

    I think many people are so stressed that they normalize their symptoms.
     People think it is "normal" to have diarrhea a couple of times a week, or
    "normal" to have a bowel movement every other day.  They often forget
    symptoms when they come to see us because they consider their symptoms to
    be "normal" for them.  That is why I think the initial interview is so
    important.  With the questions we ask, we can get a more complete picture
    of the client's issues.  Because, like in your case, sometimes we have to
    treat a condition we know is there, before the body will even show it to
    us.

    What is described here, is typically a person who is stressed and his
    Adrenals must be exhausted. When such a patient arrives directly from his
    work, it is very likely that there are many Endorphins.
    If you have so many Endorphins. then an accurate diagnosis is not possible.
    He or she needs to relax first. Gallbladder remedies are very useful with
    such patients.

    Session 4

    Client: heartburn decreased from 10 to 4, but still main complaint. Acid
    reflux when bending down (to tie shoes) Stayed out of Spin Inversion one
    night and one day, but after 2 days it was there again.

    Measurements:

    Measured Spin Inversion and treated 2 times with fresh blood. Temporarily
    resolved.

    2-7 program with Atropinum for relaxation

    Question: 
    1. Should I have done more like Carol says above? Add Gelsemium,
    Spascupreel and Placenta in addition to Atropinum and do 2-7 twice and
    recheck Gallbladder? Just when I think I know the rules they seem to
    change. But I appreciate your feedback Carol and it does make sense on some
    level. I'll keep trying to learn and understand, Johan. I do have a number
    of great cases but it makes most sense to share the difficult ones here.

    Measurements:
    Triple Warmer (L) - All drops but Pituitary
    Circulation - 3 drops
    Veins - 1 drop
    Heart - All drops
    Nervous System - 4 drops
    Triple Warmer (R) - All drops but Sex Organs 

    No drops on feet!

    Treatment:
    Whiplash Treatment corrects Parathyroid and Thyroid 
    Didn't measure everything again because he was going in and out of
    Spin-Inversion had to treat X2 again with Spin Inversion Treatment.
   
    Standard Program >12:
    Selenium, Calculi Billiaris, Hamamelis, Salmonella Paratyphi, Brucella
    Abortus Bang, Campylobacter Pylori, Chronic Tonsillitis and Mercury 
   
    All drops resolved.

    Footplate Treatment:
    Cerebrum, Viscum, Thalamus because Triple Warmer keeps dropping (unusual by
    now)
    Chelidonium, Berberis, Barijodeel, Nux Vomica, Mercuriusheel

    Kidney meridian Good, no more drops

    Questions: 
    2. If this continues to be the "wrong" approach should I measure next time/
    get him out of Spin Inversion and remeasure and then just put in all
    Gallbladder remedies on the Standard >12 Program and see what happens? This
    feels like 3 steps forward and 2 steps back.

    3. Is there a relationship between number of supports and nosodes? Like one
    support per Nosode or symptom or most affected Organ System?

    Session 5

    Symptoms:
    Heartburn down to 1-2 for a few days from 10 (worst) but bad again past 3
    days.
    (I'm guessing he was out of Spin Inversion for a few days.) No headaches
    this week. Heartburn worse when eating or laying down.

    Measurements:
    Triple Warmer, Circulation & Heart top 2 points left = Spin Inversion
    Treated 2X with fresh blood

    Triple Warmer (L) - Adrenals (Selenium), Insulin (Cholecystitis)
    Small Intestine (L) - All Drop: (Salmonella Parathyphi and Salmonella
    Typhi)
    Small Intestine (R) - Distal 3 drop: (Cholecystitis, Ulcus Venticuli &
    Ulcus Duodeni)

    Standard Program >12: 
    Blood in cup with spiral attached
    Selenium, Cholecystitis, Salmonella Parathyphi, Salmonella
    Typhi, Cholecystitis, Ulcus Venticuli, Ulcus Duodeni

    Support: Injeel-Chol, Chelidonium, Atropinum

    All drops corrected.

    Footplate Treatment:
    Selenium, Berberis, Nux Vomica, Mucosa, Hepar, Hepeel, Galium, Spascupreel

    No drops after, Kidneys OK 

    Questions: 
    1. Did I use too many supports? 
    2. Is there a relationship between Nosodes and Support i.e. no more than
    one Support per Nosode?

    1) Question: session 4: What had caused this sudden Whiplash? 
    Also the Thyroid and Parathyroid were balanced, but what balanced all the
    other points on the Triple Warmer?

    2) People going in and out of Spin Inversion is highly unusual. Do an
    Energy treatment immediately after the Spin Inversion Treatment: Selenium,
    Berberis, Tonico, Aletris, Aesculus, Ozaliet (2-7 year Program) and it is
    worth investigating the location of measurement (where you work). But this
    Energy treatment should keep the Electron Spin right.

    3) It is also strange that the Triple Warmer keeps dropping. It might be
    that the Aura is affected, but then really everything should be dropping,
    or it is Tonsillitis or Appendicitis.

    4) When energy is down, stress gets up => Increased Gallbladder dysfunction
    => more Heartburn.

    5) If there are Ulcers: use Erigotheel, Gastricumheel, Duodenoheel, Nux
    Vomica, Mucosa, Chelidonium and Atropinum as supports

    6) I would use about 8 supports as maximum. 

    7) I do not see any logic in Carol's recommendation as far as remedies are
    concerned and also running the short program two times is not necessary.
    The more remedies you use in a program before measurement, the more issues
    might get masked. So only use Atropinum to relax the system.

    Thanks Johan

    1) No new Whiplash history despite needing it 3 times in 5 sessions. I
    don't know why he had whiplash again.
    Could it be because he goes quickly into Spin Inversion so the whiplash
    treatment doesn't "take"? 

    2) If I find Spin Inversion next time, I will do the energy treatment right
    after Spin Inversion Treatment,  Pneumonic: B-TAAOS = Berberis, Tonico,
    Aesculus, Aletris, Ozaliet, Selenium

    3) Yes it is odd the Triple Warmer keeps dropping. I thought here too
    perhaps If he doesn't stay out of Spin Inversion for 3 days after Biophoton
    session this could happen

    4) OK so definetly energy treatment next time

    5) Ulcers; Support Pneumonic= C. G.A.D. M.E.N. (instead of 'see god men'
    with ulcers...) 
    Chelidonium Gastricumheel Atropinum Duodenoheel Mucosa Erigotheel Nux
    vomica 
    (Does this help anybody other than me?)

    6) IF I use 4 or 6 nosodes ONLY to balance all points can I still use 8
    supports? In this situation is it better to have the supports in the
    footplate 'dyslexia' program OR put a few in with the nosodes in the
    Standard >12 program?

    7) OK so Atropinum is best to relax the system

    I have not neutralized the proton pump inhibitor because if he's not
    significantly better in 10 sessions he might go back on it...could this
    explain the recurrent Spin and or Whiplash? If I neutralize the protonpump
    inhibitor do I have any idea how long that effect could last? 
    There is some client fear i.e. could this now be esophageal cancer. I am
    not using Bush and Bach instead trying to solve this with nosodes and
    support.

    Great case to follow. Thank you for all the information.  Yes, Toril I like
    your pneumonics. They do help! 

     I am working with 2 proton pump inhibitor clients and I too wonder when
    and if we should neutralize the PPI.  I do know Johan says in general do
    not neutralize the midication or at least not until they are off of it and
    want to get it out of their system. 

    But Johan, Karolina, in these cases of PPI's would it not help move the
    healing along faster to neutralize it if they were committed to staying off
    of it.  I understand Toril's not wanting to because the client may want to
    go back on it, but what about the ones vowing never to go back. Would it
    help the rebound situation to neutralize?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    April 2013 edited April 2013 Flag
    You can neutralize a drug when a client has committed to stop the
    medication for some time (or permanently) of course. If you do it only once
    after the last pill is taken this would be enough. 
    This way you can also see what difference not taking the medication +
    neutralization makes.

    The safest way to neutralize anything is making a remedy out of it with the
    Neutralization Program and then running it with the Standard Programs (with
    filter).

    Proton Pump Inhibitor (or any other drug) can't cause Whiplash or Spin
    Inversion. Especially if she has already stopped taking it, this is not
    something to worry about at all.

    Answers to previous post:
    1) Spin Inversion doesn't reverse a Whiplash treatment, Whiplash is an
    energetic condition that is "healed" instantly when you treat it. So if
    you've measured after running one or two Whiplash Programs that the Thyroid
    and Parathyroid are corrected this will stick until something causes a new
    Whiplash.
    Spin Inversion stops the healing process initiated by treatment, but for
    healing the Whiplash there's no process... There's no organ that has to
    start healing as a response on the treatment to heal the Whiplash (of
    course there are physical consequences of the Whiplash, that do take time
    to heal but they won't create the Whiplash back). 
   
    2) The Energy Remedies you should integrate into your whole session and
    shouldn't be run on a separate program right after Spin Inversion. You can
    put them as support on the Footplates. 
    Also the optimal way of supporting the energy problem is observing what the
    cause is. If someone has Jet Lag or worked too hard for example you might
    want to use Cocculus as a remedy.... Aletris is good when someone is tired
    because of prolonged illness and anaemia, and so on...
    If someone is going in an out of Spin in the same session, something went
    wrong in correcting the Spin Inversion (I used to have this when I used the
    Bush/Bach protocol, which I now have learnt doesn't correct Spin Inversion
    but masks it) or the treatment room is the problem or you're in Spin
    Inversion yourself and pull your client back in....
   
    3) This is possible..
   
    5) It is nice to remember remedies that are good for Ulcers this way, but
    remember to not get hooked on recipes. A client might also need support for
    other systems so you don't have enough space for all remedies and then you
    should be able to pick from that list the ones that make the most sense for
    this client. This means deepening your understanding of every remedy is
    very important.
   
    6) There's no standard for this. You can just fill the whole >12 program
    with both needed nosodes an supports. And then some on the footplates.
   
    7) It is all about using as little remedies in preparation (before
    measuring) as needed, to not lose valuable information or mask serious
    problems. Even Atropinum might correct Gallbladder drops that maybe need a
    nosode for example. But if there's no way of measuring because of
    Endorphins, there's no other way than to try and relax the system. If
    Atropinum doesn't work, Viscum and Plumbum might be needed too...

    Session 6

    Balanced hands first before I measured the feet to save time (client in a
    hurry), after hands were corrected the feet had no more drops.

    Measurements:
    Triple Warmer (L - Insulin) - Selenium
    Triple Warmer R - Thyroid) - Thyroidea
    Circulation (L - Allergy/Veins, one drop) - Calculi billiaris
    Small Intestine (L - 2 drops) Salmonella Typhi
    Large Intestine (R - 2 distal) - Chronic Appendicitis & Appendicitis
    Heart (L - 1 drop) - Streptococcus
    Nervous system (2 drops) - Mercury
    Support - Strumeel

    Kidney Meridian OK prior to >12 Program

    Short Treatment: with Mercury and Mercurisheel as Nervous System drops
    noted after initial standard >12 Program (I think)

    Footplates: Nux Vomica, Berberis, Atropinum, Chelidonium, Injeel-Chol,
    Barijodeel, Aurumheel, Circulo

    All was balanced in the end.

    Peter, 
    Yes that's a good idea in Ulcers (consider C-GAD MEN as possible supports
    => Chelidonium, Gastricumheel, Atropinum, Duodenoheel, Mucosa, Erigotheel,
    Nux Vomica) 

    But Karolina says there are no recipes so I find it challenging to know
    which supports to prioritize. I already thought maybe there were too many
    supports relative to nosodes although there are no clear rules on this. The
    good news is the client is significantly better. 

    Here is my thinking i.e. support in the last session: Johan & Karolina
    frequently mention Gallbladder problems in Ulcer patients so I used
    Selenium, Berberis, Chelidonium and Injeel Chol. 
    Then because the Liver had several drops I supported with Hepar, hepeel,
    for the symptom of heartburn even though it is now 1 of 10 and no drops on
    digestion I used Mucosa and Momordica because that can help epigastric
    complaints (he has discomfort where eating pipe meets stomach = epigastric
    area/ he has visible ulcers of eating pipe= esophagus) I thought that was
    enough and Nervoheel because of many drops on nervous system..

    Questions

    1. Should I have prioritized other supports? If so why?

    2. Did I use too many supports?

    3. I think I am getting close to end of treatment series. What do the
    experts think?

    4. Any suggestions i.e. how I can "wrap this up quickly" as I am treating
    in a different location soon and client may not be able to travel to see me
    weekly.

    5. Should I do a Scar Treatment with Procrainum at junction of Esophagus
    and Stomach which is approximately Solar Plexus area? If I don't hear
    anything I will do that next time perhaps I should have done it earlier.

    Getting results is FUN :)

    Heartburn is a condition that is caused by the Gallbladder, not by the
    Duodenum,

    I do not see that you use too many supports
    If you want to wrap it quickly, I suggest you focus on Liver/Gallbladder

    Symptoms: 
    Heartburn much improved 2 or 1 of 10. Still some discomfort first thing in
    the morning with food and at lunchtime. Nights are now good, no heartburn.
    No headaches.

    Measurements:
    All Spin Inversion points drop
    Spin Inversion Program 2 times with fresh blood in cup => Spin Inversion
    resolved


    Measurement and >12 Treatment:
    No drops on Hands.

    Stomach (L - distal point) - Ulcus Ventriculi, added Ulcus Duodeni as well
    Liver (L - 2nd point from toe tip) - Pfeiffer
    Gallbladder (R - 3 drops) - Adenomyose Gallenblase
    Liver (R - distal point)
    Support: Atropinum, Berberis, Chelidonium, Spascupreel

    Kidneys - no problem

    Check up measurement: All balanced.

    Footplate Treatment: 
    Injeel-chol, Tonico, Ozaliet, Selenium, Aesculus, Nux Vomica, Erigotheel,
    Hepar 
    (Blood in Cup still connected)

    Check up measurement: All balanced

    Results: Client considers himself 90% improved compared to the first few
    days off of dexilant medication.

    This may be final session for a while. Thanks for all the help. 

    Question: 
    Gallbladder / Liver day today as you said. This gentleman is definitely a

    But it might be wise too discover the Magnetic Source of the Spin
    Inversion. So you can change the Environmental Cause.

    Johan, Probably his place of employment. Journalist on computers 10 hours a

    But usually Clients will get a feel for Spin Inversion once they have gone
    in and out of it several times. Awareness is the first step...

Wrist/Ankle Weakness

DaphnaDaphna
October 2014 edited October 2014 in Symptoms Flag
Client:
Woman who has been sick for 30 years with Lyme and co-infections. 

Symptoms:
Very frail from osteoporosis  
Eyesight has mostly been lost => she thinks due to Lyme + a botched cataract
operation

Reaction after the first session:
Wrist became much weaker

2nd session:
We did most of the light with just her feet. She then noticed a lot of stuck
energy in her feet. 

3rd session:
I gave her a short treatment with her hands and her feet => she has noticed her
ankles giving out on her. 

Questions:
1. Any ideas what's going on with her interaction with the light? 
2. She has noticed more shooting nerve pain and tingling in her hands and feet.
Any suggested remedies for the shooting nerve pain and the tingling?
3. Veratrum doesn't test for her... do you have other remedy suggestions for
lost vision. At the moment she doesn't have any drops on her stomach meridian

    Many factors can be affecting the body, especially during balancing for
    Lyme. Once the lyme gets agitated it seems to flare up, especially around
    the tissues it affected. So depending on what these areas that are mostly
    affected, there could be the flaring of symptoms accordingly. In many
    cases, as well as yours, Lyme affects the cerebral and spinal tissues. This
    could explain the disturbance of the vision when affecting certain cerebral
    tissues, and the peripheral nerves when it affects the spinal tissues. It
    could be affecting L5 for the ankles to give out for instance. Not to
    mention Lyme can also heavily affect the Gallbladder, the meridian of which
    passes through the ankles. This could be another factor explaining why the
    ankles are weak. Also I found Coxsackie B4 to show up and cause all sorts
    of spinal inflammation causing asthmas, panic attacks, and other peripheral
    nerve conditions among myriad of other symptoms. These are some of my
    thoughts. Hopefully your client can endure these usual Lyme aggravations of
    the healing process.

    I have had clients with Lyme experience this also.

    Remember in homeopathic's "like cures like" so sometimes people experience
    the same symptoms or an exaggeration of a symptom you are treating for, but
    it does subside as you stimulate their immune system to begin to regenerate
    and rid itself of anything foreign. Following protocol alone wakes up the
    body and it begins to function again. They are experiencing the treatment
    working and their body beginning to function again.

    Hi Daphna,

    Can you give more information about this woman's history and the
    progression of symptoms?

    Was she in an accident at one point? Does she have scars, or whiplash? Did
    you treat for those? Energy "getting stuck" sounds like there's some kind
    of blockage… 

    Focussing on Lyme diagnosis, heavily distracts from noticing what is right
    in front of you. There are so many ideas and dogmas that surround this
    diagnosis… The Biontology approach is simple and effective as it does not
    have a recipe for every separate disease (focussing on the disease is
    trying to model a holistic approach into a similar approach as the current
    medical system has). 

    You need to assess what presents itself to you, listen to the story, be
    open to the experience of the client, observe very carefully without
    pre-judgement, measure objectively and give the body what it needs in the
    right order. Balancing the body's light communication system follows a
    certain order. Going against this can cause unnecessary stress to the body.

    Aggravation of symptoms can be a flare up that proceeds healing, but it
    does not necessarily needs to be. So it is important to observe what is
    really happening. If the symptom only aggravates for a day or two after
    which the condition improves it can be a healing reaction, but if there is
    no consequent improvement it can also be an adverse reaction that should
    make you think about what in your treatment might have caused it.

    The more information we get, the better we can assist...

    The fact that she has osteoporosis indicates that there are problems with
    her Calcium metabolism. Did you treat this, did you treat the rest of her
    Hormonal System?
    The fact that she experieces joint issues indicates Kidney insufficiency.

    We indeed need a lot more info, and especially the measurements.

    Hello,
    Thank you all for the feedback!
    I just saw my client on Thursday and wrote down what we did... RE:
    Karolina's question, she became ill 30 years ago following a big mold
    outbreak and clearing in her home. She also has Drusen (on her optic
    nerve), which isn't supposed to effect her vision but may be in addition to
    the lyme and mold exposure.She gets a lot of pressure behind her eyes. she
    also had a cataract operation on one eye that went wrong and lost more
    vision at that point. She did have whiplash in her first treatment and we
    cleared it. no scars. She has never gotten better from any treatments in
    the past and has become a lot worse every time... so she has a lot of fear
    and victim energy around the whole process. She's also super frail and
    sensitive so we go very, very easy/slowly.

    Left hand:
    parathyroid dropped:Cholera and selenium
    it cleared the entire triple warmer on her left hand. Her pituitary is
    staying stable from her treatment on her first visit. 
    Circulation dropped: circulo and aspergilus
    nervous system: neuro-injeel
    lymph-lymphosot
    Right hand:
    pancreas secretion:nux vomica
    homorne drop: hormeel
    heart drop:cartegus heel

    feet:
    gallbladder: adneygose galablas and chelidonion and belladonna
    kidneys:Reneel and populous

    I forgot to mention that her inflammation in her writs and ankles continued
    to get worse and have stayed inflamed. because of this she was afraid of
    too much light exacerbating her inflammation so we did a total of 8-12 3x's
    for the hand measurements and the feet measurements.

    Focus, treating in the right order and using nosodes like it is described
    in the updated manual are the basics of gentle and efficient sessions with
    little side effects.

    The Kidneys are clearly the biggest problem for this woman, and they still
    drop. Your choice to only use support remedies to balance them is not the
    right approach that is going to solve her Kidney insufficiency. The main
    focus should be all on the Kidneys and matching nosodes need to be found. 

    Before you find that the Kidneys are not dropping anymore during your first
    measurement of a session, your client is not ready to focus on the Nervous
    System and Heart yet and you can easily leave the drops for now. Drops on
    the organ systems of focus need to be mainly remedied with nosodes and then
    the support remedies should be focussed on supporting those same organ
    systems. 

    To avoid misinterpretation of what I wrote: The focus should be on the
    Kidneys, but of course the Hormone System still needs to be corrected first
    as always.

    Hi Karolina,
    Just saw my client. Her kidneys are balanced. on her left hand (hormonal
    system) her adrenals are still dropping, i supported them with both
    selenium and berberis. On her right hand (hormonal system) coxsackie b4
    showed in relation to her hormonal point. this also balanced her nervous
    system. 
    She is moving along according to the cherin... my main question is around
    the inflammation and weakness she started to experience since she started
    the treatments. it's pretty debilitating for her. what remedies might you
    suggest for this inflammation? I've been including belladonna
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    November 2014 edited November 2014 Flag
    Sometimes ankle weakness can be caused by the Bladder, Gallbladder and/or
    Kidney meridian(s). You can determine what meridian is the cause through
    the location of the weakness. The clue lies in if the weakness is on the
    inside of outside of the ankles.

    However, in this case there is a combined weakness in both ankles and
    wrists. Because it is the joints that are most affected, her reaction might
    be and arthritis flare up. This indicates Kidneys that do not clean the
    blood well. Since her Kidneys drop after so little treatment (mainly
    support) they must be very weak.

    I would not do 3 times the 8-12 year treatment, but the 2-7 year program
    and only once at this stage.
    First the hormonal system and kidneys must be good.
    Energetically good does not necessarily mean physically good. You can have
    a perfect car but if you do not put physical gas in it, it will not drive.
    Always include both measurements AND symptoms in your assessment.

Radionics - Interference?

janjan
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Other Therapies & Instruments Flag
I have not one client but many who see me and are also being treated by a
gentleman doing Radionics.  

I have read about it and it is doing remote energetic meridian disturbance
balancing usig hair blood or whatever.  Some say it is powerful some say it
does nothing.... I have suggested to all that they not do multiple energetic
modalities while we are working together as they may overload their body and
negate the healing process. Most have stopped the radionics for now and many
have "graduated" now clear with biophoton fromtheir illnesses.

Question: one of the clients we are both (Radionics and I) working on has
advanced metasized prostate cancer with a large tumor and very serious
problems. He is coming to me once a week and his points are changing slowly but
he is having radionics broadcasts sometimes 2x a day and is using homeopathy (
he is homeopath.)

He is in extreme pain, each time I see him I "feel/sense" the conflict with
radionics and feel that it may be undoing or increasing what I am doing and I
also wonder if it can be increasing the pain.  So the other day I said that I
felt what I was doing may not be effective if he was doing such radionic work,
nor if he was counting on the radionics, and since this is life threatening,
perhaps that was being negated by what I was doing.  I felt he needed to make a
choice and I would honor whatever choice he made. Is that the correct way to
approach it or...would you just continue to work along with the radionics
hoping their "readings" were taking into account the remedying the chiren is
doing?

I know your thoughts on multiple modalities, how do you think I should approach
it with this gentleman who is using a homeopathics/radionics/biophoton shotgun
approach to save his life and are you familiar with radionics.

Thank you, i need advice as to how to continue.

    I am very familiar with Radionics. I know exactly how it works, if it
    works. A lot depends on the Practitioner. 

    Radionics is a one-way form of treatment whereby a witness (blood, hair) is
    necessary. the Radionics guy is making his diagnosis on the base of the
    witness. Radionics is the same as Voodoo (Voodoo is an ancient healing
    method) in that respect and connections can be established.

    With Radionics there is always the Practitioner involved and Objectivity is
    almost impossible since his own energies are always involved in Diagnosing.

    As long as you do not know what the other person is doing, there is no way
    of telling whether he is blocking what you try to do. He can be a
    homeopath, but homeopathy is also based on symptoms.

    If he is sending Homeopathic Frequencies, you need to know which ones and
    at what they are targeted. Then perhaps you can judge their effect. But in
    general I would not advise to use anything next to the Chiren since it is
    already very complete and it is likely you will introduce disruptive
    information with the other modalities... there's no filter there.

    Thank you Johan, that is what my gut is telling me, but you said "in
    general"....

    The client is a homeopath and is working also with another master
    homeopath, and each time I have asked him what they are using, sometimes
    causticum, sometimes sulphur, and so on, but the radionics man ....I have
    no idea what he is doing. What I do know however is that he has his clients
    best interest at heart and there is no "black magic" of any sort, nor
    intentional blocking of my "medicine" but perhaps unintended consequences
    of too much adjusting, detoxing, remedying.

    I have asked to meet with him and say "how are you treating and when and
    what," but that hasn't happened, I think he just does what he sees...often.
    I do not believe the radionics man is sending homeopathic frequencies
    because he and the homeopathic master spoke and agreed they would each do
    their own thing and it would not interfer, and maybe so but I feel with
    biophoton too many people are doing too many things.

    He said he (the radionics man) removed (and saw) a big flat fluke from the
    client's intestine and he (the client) would stop bleeding, which he did.
    But how do we know why, because I was treating an ulcer also..so, back to
    the advice question.
    I do know he will still choose homeopathy also as that is what he is, and
    he trusts the master homeopath - We have discussed if homeopathy was
    working for him, he would not have this, however he still chooses it.

    Question: If I understand you clearly, I should then ask him to choose his
    modality, either radionics or this..correct? Can I get an answer I can
    quote for him? - Thanks!

    Homeopathy and Radionics work on symptoms only. Chiren works on causes, but
    symptoms are important indicators as to where the causes might lie. By
    removing symptoms these indicators disappear which might leave you in the
    dark.
    And if you leave the causes sitting there, the problems will definitely
    return, If they go away at all.
    So, you should know exactly what they are working on and see if what they
    are working on Supports or Hinders your Treatment.
    Usually these kind of treatments only block the healing process that is
    initiated by Chiren. It is best to let him choose one modality.

    Apart from pressure due to constipation, what else can cause hemorrhoids?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    June 2015 Flag
    There are two factors involved in the cause of haemorrhoids and those are:
    1. The amount of pressure on the rectal/anal area
    2. The strength of the veins, especially the valves

    Whenever the pressure is too much to handle for the veins, haemorrhoids may
    appear.
    There is always a level of basic pressure on the rectal/anal area due to
    normal peristalsis, so weakness of the veins alone may be the cause.
    On the other end of the spectrum there is the situation of having so much
    pressure on the anal area, that even when the veins are healthy,
    haemorrhoids may be caused.
    But usually it is a little bit of both: weak veins in combination with too
    much pressure.

    Pressure on the rectum can be caused by constipation, diarrhea, intestinal
    gas, anal tension due to stress, heavy weight lifting, prolonged sitting/
    standing, pregnancy and child birth, anal sex...

    Rectal veins are directly connected with the Liver through the portal vein.
    When there is actual physical Liver cirrhosis in an advanced stage, the
    blood flow towards the Liver may become stagnated which increases the blood
    pressure in the veins that are located in the rectal area of the
    Intestines. This is indeed another cause of pressure that leads to
    haemorrhoids...

Solar Activity

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
July 2014 edited July 2014 in Biontology Insights Flag
An insightful quote I took from the internet:

"According to study published in the New Scientist back in 1998, there is a
direct connection between the Sun’s solar storms and human biological effects.
The conduit which facilitates the charged particles from the Sun to human
disturbance — is the very same conduit which steers Earth’s weather —– the
magnetic field. Animals and humans have a magnetic field which surrounds them —
in the very same way the magnetic field surrounds the Earth as a protector.
The Effect of Solar Flares on Our Pineal Gland
From 1948 to 1997, the Institute of North Industrial Ecology Problems in Russia
found that geomagnetic activity showed three seasonal peaks each of those years
(March to May, in July, and in October). Every peak matched an increased
incidence of anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and suicide in the city
Kirovsk.
Electromagnetic activity from the sun affects our electronic devices and human
electromagnetic field. We are physically, mentally, and emotionally altered by
electromagnetic charges from the sun, our body can feel sleepy but also become
highly energized.
Psychological effects of CMEs (coronal mass ejections) are typically short
lived and include headache, palpitations, mood swings, and feeling generally
unwell. Chaotic or confused thinking, and erratic behaviors also increase.
Solar storms can drive our emotions and maximize it to both good and bad side –
the point here is to be aware of it.
The pineal gland in our brain is also affected by the electromagnetic activity
which causes the gland to produce excess melatonin, a hormone which can cause
sleepiness but it’s also known that some people have opposite side effects,
usually those that are aware of the effects."

Luckily we have an antidote… Spin Inversion Treatment! 
And of course strengthening the body's resilience and using a good ionizer is
also recommended.

    Thank you Karolina for explaining about the changing of remedies. It was
    good to get this information, too. Sometimes one can make assumptions
    (dangerous thing to do, obviously!!), if something works on one thing, it
    can work on the other. I knew the dosages changed, so I was sure that one
    could not change during the Standard treatment. Still good to get concrete
    response on this. I'm sure there are people who have heard they can change
    remedies in the Dyslexia treatment, who also believe you can do the same on
    the Standard. This would be a good thing to tell every student in the first
    block. We were never told we could change anything in the Dyslexia program
    in Block I, and that has made a huge difference for me in being able to
    give more supports to patients.

    So she has both sleeping disorders: 1. Sleeping In and 2. Sleeping Through
    (waking up all the time during the night)
    1 is generally related to Gallbladder / Liver Disorders. 
    2 can often be solved with Schwefheel

    There are more possibilities to treat the Circulation: 
    Gallbladder, Aesculus, Circulo, Glonoin and perhaps it is the Adrenals. The
    functioning of the Adrenals can be ok, but the body might still lack
    Potassium.

    But the problems can definitely also be caused by Magnetic Fields or by
    Radiation from Clock Radios or Mobile Phones. 
    So, if there is any doubt, ask her to sleep on an airbed that she puts
    elsewhere in the bedroom or the house. If she sleeps better, you'll know
    the bed or the location of the bed is the Cause for the Sleeping Problems.

    correct it. Looking foward to se the reactions.

    I messured here in here home today.

    12 year hand treatment:
    Dropping: bladder, galbladder many points.
    Large intestine-all matched with Dioxine.

    Foot treatment:
    Messured no drops. Supported galbladder.


    After I messured here in here soffa- spends most of here day there. Soffa
    has spirals in it.
    Bladder dropped. Kidney one point dropped.
    Will advise here to buy a sheep whol and then we will messure if it helps
    when she is sitting on that in the sofa.

    Messured in bed.

    Steep drops on bladder.
    Shut down wifi-dropps where clear.

    Messured here with mobile close to bed. Dropped on bladder point again.

    She sleeps 3 meters from fusebox. Its in the same room. But when I shut
    down the wifi and put out electrical devices out of the room there where no
    drops.

    She sleeps on a spiral bed. She tested an air madress for a whole week. Was
    worse she said. The bed was to soft for here back. The complaints where not
    getting better from sleeping on the madress.

    But I guess that with the wifi on in the house she would not se any
    diffrence with the airbed?

    She and here boyfriend are sceptical about the information that electrical
    devices are bad for the body. But she said that hearing the points reacting
    in this way she belive it more strongly. But mostly its here boyfriend
    thats thinks its silly and dont want to change things.

    I already told here in the beginning to put the electrical devices away.
    She now says she will shut down wifi unless alitle time when its used in
    evenings. And put electrical devices away when sleeping.

    Questions:
    1. The fusebox witch is only 3 m away from here in the bedroom. And she is
    sleeping on a spiral madress. I dont messure any drops on here in bed now
    without all the electrical devices nearby.
    Does that mean it is a safe sleaping place now for here?

    Reactions:
    improvment finally. :) After last session it changed the first night. No
    cramps in her leg the whole night. And it has cept on going for a week now.
    She is very happy. She tried to have the mobile phone close to here bed one
    night and the leg started cramping again. So she removed it again. I guess
    she wanted to test it.
    I think it shows that she is very sensitiv to radiation. It was so fun to
    see how much diffrent things effected here messurments in here home. And
    the effect it gave by removing it.

    Question:
    Any other things she should still correct about here living enviroment?
    Since it seams to really help here to remove those things.
    I had an question above about the fusebox.

    Looking foward to messure here again when I get my chiren back:)

Client:
18 yr old female who I have not seen yet.

Symptoms:
Blue fingers when she gets a chill with sloughing of the tips of her fingers.
Skin that is very very tight all over.
Irregular heart rhythms. Low and High. MD told her to drink water and eat salt.
Chronic Exhaustion.
Headaches

Medication:
Cilas => gives some relief. 

Questions:  
1. I am thinking after doing the initial protocol that Circulation, Galbladder/
Liver should be the focus. 
2. What should be my areas of focus with her when I see her in January?

    - Test the body
    - Follow protocol. 
    - Treat scars if necessary. 
    - Many people have had a Whiplash or feel/have felt disconnection between
    head an body
    - Test/treat hormonal system first.
    - Find out about trauma
    - The system has to be brought back to life. 
   
    With exhaustion a good place to start is paying attention to the Adrenals. 

    Headaches => find out when they occur. Look at organ clock for clues to
    which organ may be activated at that time. 
    Always consider dehydration as a cause. I ALWAYS ask people how much water
    are they usually drinking on a daily basis.

    Hi "anonymous" ;-)

    When you have several symptoms, you always need to look at the connection.

    Blue fingers and shedding skin => circulatory issues = can be
    Calcification, Adrenals, Gallbladder (cramping)
    Irregular heartbeat => Gallbladder (palpitations) or Adrenals (slow
    heartbeat, but fast on exertion)
    Chronic exhaustion => Adrenals, Liver, Spin Inversion, digestive problems
    (especially Intestinal Flora)
    Headaches => I need to have more information about the kind of headaches
    she has...

    MD tells her to eat salt with her water => points toward his/her suspicion
    of Adrenal problems
   
    Answers:
    1 & 2 First suspicion would be on the Adrenals (but what is the cause of
    this?), and insufficient water intake.
    Gallbladder, Calcification, Circulation.... all important. Your measurement
    will give very important information that now is missing...

No Drop Sounds

Daniel O'Driscoll
March 2014 edited April 2014 in Measurement Flag
Hello, I am a new student only finishing the Basic course this February. 

Measurement problem
I am having trouble getting accurate measurements on myself or on another
person. I can easily find the points, but what I am having trouble with is
getting Any drop sounds! Yet, the other person and myself both experience clear
symptoms.

Symptoms
Very low energy,
Body pain, 
Depression, 
Low back pain, 
Cold hands & feet.

Work Environment
As a jeweler, I do work with: 
2 electric motors that are essential to my work (1. flex shaft, something like
a low speed version of a dental drill. 2. small filter vent fan) 
I have eliminated all other toxic things in my studio.

I have had 3 first treatments with another therapist this January. 

1st Session
Whiplash, 
Spin Inversion

Hand Treatment:
Anti Tetanus, Poliomyelitis, Aesculus, Pertussis, Causticum, Chronic
Appendicitis and Tuberculinum

Foot plates: 
Serum Ovile, Thyroidea, Viscum, Thalamus, Cerebrium, Cognis essence, Calm &
Clear.

Short Program: 
Ozaliet, Causticum, Crab Apple, Electro essence., Space Clearing.

2nd session

Hand Treatment:
Chronic Appendicitis, Berberis, Variolinum, Mercury, Bacteria Pyo, Bacteria
Coli, Aluminum

Footplates:
Berberis, Hormeel, Ceanothus, Hepar, Aesculus, Barijodeel, Ozaliet

Short Program:
Ozaliet, Causticum, Crab Apple, Electro Essence, Space Clearing Essence.

3rd session 

Hand Treatment:
Plumbum, Formaldyhyde, Cyslyonephritis, Cantharis, Campylobacter, Cadmium,
Atropinum, Berberis

Footplates: 
Causticum, Aesculus, Barijodeel, Meditation Essence, Cognis Essence, Calm &
Clear.

Treating myself:

=> Feeling that I was experiencing an endorphin mask, I ran a Spin Inversion
session with blood in cup . Then measured once again. Still No Drops. I don't
experience sweaty hands, so that's eliminated. No drugs of any kind, no
vitamins or exercise. I have been treating just symptoms just to get some
relief, boost my energy a bit and to see if I can start to find accurate
measurements to start treating with Nosodes. I clearly understand that treating
only symptoms with remedies does Not get to the Cause of the problem, but only
as a way to uncover the endorphin mask.
=>  Spin Inversion treatments => followed by a 2-7 Program (Causticum, Space
Clearing, Fringed Violet, Selenium, Berberis)
=> Also, I've run the dyslexia program without remedies.
=> All of these things have been an attempt to unmask the endorphins. I do
understand the importance of getting good accurate measurements to form a total
health picture and add nosodes to eliminate causes. 

I have run a standard program of these supports for energy:
Selenium, Berberis, Testis, Cocculus, Tonico, Ubichinon, Coenzyme, Viscum,
Thalamus
 
Experience:
The Spin Inversion seems to help the most with Energy.

Questions:
1. I'm wondering if something in my work environment is causing Spin Inversion
(see top of this post mentioning jewelry machinery.)

2. Can a weakened condition of the body also be affecting the Electron Spin? 

3. Please advise me on what I can start to doing to get accurate measurements I
can start finding the cause of illness and adding nosodes to my treatments.

Thank you, 
Daniel

    Welcome Daniel,

    I will try to answer your questions and also will comment on things that I
    notice, when reading your notes.

    Answers:
    1. Work or Living Environment is often the cause of Spin Inversion, but 
    Spin Inversion is not the cause of all-over Endorphins. The only situations
    I have encountered that caused all points to stay level are caused by
    jogging/running/working out every day or clients who just left from their
    hectic job/situation before treatment.

    If you fall in one of these categories, you'll need to stop for about a
    week and then see if drops will appear.
    Many MD's prescribe activity for people that are fatigued, This is not a
    wise recommendation. You must not spend energy that you do not have. 

    When you indeed are in Spin Inversion all the time, you need to find the
    Cause. This might be your work environment, but it can also be something
    else in your living environment.

    Some possible causes:
    - your chair
    - your bed
    - appliances
    - wiring of your home
    - magnetic disturbance of the earth
    - hybrid/electric cars
    - etc. (there are many potential reasons)

    You can start finding out by eliminating one factor after another.
    If you choose for example a different chair on which you sit during your
    work, a chair without any metal, then see if you still get Spin
    Inversions.When you do, then the chair is not the Cause, but it might be
    the place where the chair stands. You can also try to sleep on an airbed
    for a week, this way you can confirm that to be the Cause or eliminate it
    from the list.

    2. If you have no drops it is impossible to know that you are in Spin
    Inversion all the time… so I wonder why you think this.

    However, a weakened condition of the body definitely makes you more
    vulnerable to the external Magnetic Fields, since your "body's atmosphere"
    (Aura) gets thinner all the time. But it does not cause it...
    This weakened condition is always a result which then causes the next phase
    of detoriation of health. It is a vicious circle which one has to break. 

    3. Endorphins mean stress of any kind on the body. IF you are dealing with
    Endorphins, it is unlikely that you find this on every single point. So it
    is more likely that something is wrong with the measurements and that
    there's a measurement problem. 

    A possible measurement problem:
    Is the pressure you use with the probe not too high? This will cause you to
    press through the drops and then you only get straight lines.

    Comments
    * The first thing you have to do is focus. First the Triple Warmer, then
    the Kidneys and nothing else. Because you get no drops, you have to look at
    your overall condition and symptoms to guess what remedies to use.

    * Endorphins are caused by Stress. Heavy stress is generally caused by an
    overload of Toxins, whereby Emotional Suppression is also considered a
    Toxin. You will need to stimulate the Adrenal Glands and the Kidneys.

    * Never use an extra short (2-7) program unless there's no way around it
    and you still need one or two remedies because the Kidneys or Hormone
    System are still dropping at the end of your treatment (the more
    experienced you'll get, the less frequent this will happen to you!). If you
    want to use Bush or Bach remedies, use them as part of your support
    remedies on the Footplates. 

    * Unmasking Endorphins is usually done by measuring (or if necessary
    treating) with Plumbum, Atropinum and Viscum.

    * The energy treatment might give you temporary energy but does not solve
    the Cause. If you have Spin Inversion all the time, then this is probably
    the original Cause of your problems but in the mean time other disturbances
    might have developed that need to be addressed too.

    * Whenever you need to treat with Chronic Appendicitis, you must use
    Appendicitis as well.

    Hello Johan,

    Thank you for a very helpful critique. All of what you have said is such
    good learning advice. During the time I posted and your answer my Chiren
    developed a problem, it would not turn back on. After many tries, even
    trying your advice of turning off for 24 hours. I contacted the US office
    and have returned my instrument, fiber optic cable and cord for the Photon
    Cup because of a very loose connection, all for repair. I just received the
    loaner Chiren, but without cables I will not yet be able to start checking
    again. So, I'm stuck for the moment.

    Until I get up and running again.
    Thank you
    Daniel

Mobile Phone

Candace Hsiao Young
February 2015 edited February 2015 in Chiren Flag
Questions:

1. This piece of advice was in the old manual, but not the updated version: If
you take the phone apart by removing the battery or SIM card and then
reassemble it again the treatment will have lost its power and needs to be
re-run.
Is this still true?

2. Is it necessary for all members of a family exposed to a particular
cellphone, not only the person who owns the phone, to be treated by mobile
phone treatment for that specific phone?

    The old manual should be discarded. It was full of mistakes because it was
    modified to match some of the pet subjects of my former teachers. There was
    even a mentioning of "indigo children". This is just a hype. I have nothing
    with hypes. Usually these are difficult children. They may be gifted in
    some way, but usually there is a lot of delusional expectation of the
    parents. If you find anything else that is not mentioned in the new manual,
    please discard it.
   
    Answers:

    1. I do not understand what you mean by "the treatment has lost its
    power". The treatment has its effect on battery and SIM card. Whether you
    remove them or not does not make a difference. This is a strange idea made
    up by people who had access to the manual and organised my classes.


    2. The battery has a strong magnetic field, the radiation is the other
    factor.
    It is the radiation which works as a microwave oven. The exposure to the
    radiation is very harmful, especially if you are exposed to it for
    an extended period of time. After about 10 minutes on the phone you might
    feel increased heat on the side of your head. Exposing it longer, your head
    might get painful.
    You cannot get away from this radiation, it is everywhere and influences
    the body. But the closer you are to the radiation, the more intense the
    effects are. So you should not consider yourself safe when a phone has been
    treated.

    The treatment of the phone itself makes it less harmful in theory, but the
    heating up of cells will not be any less. The phone does cause less drops
    after treatment...

    If there are more persons that use the phone: if the phone is treated, that
    is sufficient. in addition one can treat each person with the phone, WHILE
    IT IS RINGING. But this treatment is not specific to the phone, so you
    don't need to treat with every phone separately.

    The most important thing is to treat against the sensitivity to the
    radiation, which lies in something else than the radiation itself.
  •

    Thanks so much for clearing this up. I, too, have noticed that the
    radiation transmitted by the phone continues to have heating effects even
    after treatment of phone itself.

Here is a link to an American company specializing in radiation shielding:
goaegis.com

They are a contractor for the U.S. Department of Defense. Their website
provides convincing background information about the dangers of cellphone
radiation and why SAR ratings fall short.

Have not tried any of their products. Waiting on a response from them about how
their products work and whether they create more radiation exposure for others
due to the principle behind these products: to deflect radiation away from
whatever is shielded.

    Has anyone found a grounding mat for the computers that meets Karolina's
    recommendation of 300 - 500 nano-tesla?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    October 2014 Flag
    A grounding mat does not protect against the effects of radiation, it only
    stops static electricity interfering with your body. 

    In a treatment environment such a mat might be beneficial since if there is
    static electricity, the measurements sound strange.

    The mats are also an antenna at the same time. What frequencies they would
    attract depends completely on the dimensions of the mat.

    I cannot imagine that Karolina has ever made a recommendation on the
    strength of the mat of 300-500 nT.
    nT is a measurement unit for the magnetic field. Grounding mats do not
    affect the magnetic field at all.
    All the grounding does, is lower the electrical field, not the magnetic
    field.

    I believe the 300-500 nT that Barbara refers to is the magnetic field that
    is the maximum field strength that people can be safely exposed to. But
    magnetic fields decrease with distance.
    However, a computer will not decrease its field strength if you use a mat.

    What Barbara was referring to is a discussion about magnetic bed pads. This
    is something different than grounding mats.

Overwriting a Card

    There is no way of knowing if the information is still intact. Also there
    is no way of knowing if after a chip card is loaded once, it is completely
    saturated or not. Maybe there's not even space for new information
    anymore. 

    So the advise is to use a new card.

EMF & Worsened Tinnitus After Treatment

umanyc
June 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client: 
38year old male, so far had 1 treatment. He is very excited to have started the
treatments and is looking forward to his next session.

History:
Long and stressful delivery (normal due date). 
Mother had pregnancy diabetes (used medicine during final 5/6 weeks) 
Placed in incubator during first month after birth, due to fits.
Comsmetic surgery (2001)

Symptoms: 
EMF since 2007/2008, always sensitive to mobile phones since 1996 and tinnitus
since 2 years. His symptons are worst after a days of work, he is a civil
engineer, But he sleeps a solid 8hours does not wake up once!!, even though he
sleeps on a box spring; he shuts off the FUSE for the complete house.

Comment from client:
He beliefs his immune system is weak as he had always colds when he was
younger, even though he has not been sick for more than 5 years

Medication: 
Phoenobarbitone: given at birth (normally given for epilepsy)
Nurofen: currently takes 2 daily

Measurement:
Spin Inversion => after 3 times running the program still no change
So I checked for, and found a Whiplash.

Triple Warmer Point for Whiplash still dropped = Scar Treatment on the Ears =>
after that he had no Spin Inversion

Drops on:
Triple Warmer
Small Intestines
Nervous System
Large Intestines

Feet => no drops

Measured Remedies:
Anti tetanus, Polio, Tuberculinum, Varicellen, Variolinum, Formaldehyde, 
Pertussis, Tonsillitis

I did check if this program was OK for the Gallbladder and Kidneys, and that
was fine. 

Footplates with Support:
Viscum, Thalamus, Cerebrum, Atropinum, Aesculus Berberis, Mucosa, Ozaliet

Results:
EMF exposure makes Tinnitis worse, which started after the treatment. This is
most likely pressure related (Gallbladder problem).

Question: 
Could the treatment have been to strong for his Gallbladder? 
Or could the birth part has something to do with this?

    It is very likely that the treatments have removed suppression and that now
    his real condition comes out.

    Tinnitis is always caused by Pressure (any form of pressure). 
    Pressure is always a Gallbladder issue.
    Seizures are also a Gallbladder issue.
    Fits are always caused by the Gallbladder system. 
   
    Fits starting at birth might be caused by his mother being under Stress/
    Pressure herself.
    The fact that he has not been sick for 5 years, might indicate Willpower
    and Extreme Suppression (= also pressure)
   
    Right now I'm experimenting with the idea that Heavy Metals can act as a
    antennas for EMF and hence can cause EMF sensitivity and/or Spin
    Inversion.

    What about seizures that are attributed to sun stroke or over exposure to
    heat? Are those still a Gallbladder issue?

    Someone just called me with a dog who is having these recently. I have not

    still be in order.

    Yes, it is still a Liver/Gallbladder issue. (In Traditional Chinese

Helper's Hole

Jiri
November 2013 edited January 2014 in Definitions Flag
Please describe the treatment for Helper's Hole and when and how it is given in
the treatment session.

Comments

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    November 2013 edited November 2013 Flag
    Hi Jiri,

    Good question that needs some explanation....

    The altruistic an innate feeling to help other people is spontaneous and
    very healthy and empowering. However, helping becomes unhealthy when it
    comes from thinking (ego = third chakra), in which case it is usually a
    compensatory tool for a lack of self worth. This kind of helping is very
    disempowering and creates an inner feeling of being used and trapped, while
    the situation in reality is self-created. 

    The imbalance in Biontology referred to as "Helper's Hole" is a weakness of
    the third chakra, that has to do with insecurity and a lack of feeling of
    Self. To compensate one starts to project the image of the "Helper", in
    combination with a feeling of being victimized by this role at the same
    time. Because the fragile sense of self is so much involved with the image
    of the Helper, there's a great difficulty in saying NO, or in other words
    to set boundaries. This creates an internal anger, that is suppressed
    because it doesn't fit the ideal image one thinks should be projected in
    order to be loved... The result is that inner power is lost and a hole or
    weak spot appears in the Aura on the level of the Solar Plexus. (Wood =
    Liver/Gallbladder are definitely involved in Helper's Hole)

    Mothers who stopped "living" (lost themselves) while taking care of their
    family often have a Helper's Hole. But also children from abusive or
    neglective parents show this disturbance frequently.

    How it shows up in measurement:
    Sharp drops on the proximal point on the Left Small Intestine meridian and
    the proximal point on the Left Large Intestine meridian that are corrected
    by Fringed Violet. 

    How to treat it:
    Considering this whole psychological dynamic, just treating the hole (with
    Fringed Violet in a standard treatment) is not sufficient.
   
    The same procedure as always when flower essences show up in measurement 
    should be followed => address what you have measured by asking questions
    around the issues you found.
   
    In the case of Helper's Hole you could for example ask/talk about:
   
    Is the help you give really appreciated? If no... why do you continue to
    help someone who doesn't value you?
   
    Do you help yourself in the same way you are helping others? Are you taking
    care of your own needs? (acknowledging the needs of the inner child instead
    of projecting it outside)
   
    Are you capable of setting boundaries/saying NO? If not... why? Are you
    adapting your reactions to get approval from others? If yes... why should
    everyone always agree with what you do? Is it not possible to do something
    that goes against other people's wishes, while it still is the RIGHT thing
    to do according to your Heart? 

    Do you feel a connection with your Heart and life's purpose? (often there's
    a huge focus on other peoples life path... especially children and partners
    can be used to project their own lack of purpose on, and often suffer from
    suffocation and unwanted "help"). 
    Imagine the situation where no one is in need of your help (no children, no
    husband etc)... what would make you happy? 
   
    Do you feel comfortable with who you are? Can you embrace your strengths
    and flaws without judgement and a need to change yourself into something
    else? Do you feel unique? 

    Just some examples... 

    Suggestions that can be given:
    Listen to your Heart

    Hi Karolina,

    Thanks for the excellent explanation of the significance and treatment for
    a helper's hole. My own notes on the treatment were not complete. Most of
    my clients have the drops although I'm not certain if they are sharp drops.
    Now I can be certain that I'm giving the correct treatment with the Chiren
    and with my discussions with them.

    Hi Jiri,

    The Helper's Hole is not the most common answer to those two points
    dropping -the points will drop very steeply when it is in fact an aura
    problem, which Helper's Hole is- usually you'll find that something like
    Appendicitis or Leptospirose will bring those points back up.

    Recently I heard that it may be helpful to apply the rods for 2-7 minutes
    with no remedies to the Solar Plexus chakra/area to repair the hole in the
    aura. Moreover, it was mentioned that Helper's Hole may make one more
    susceptible to (or be a cause of) pancreatic cancer. Ozaleit was said to be
    a remedy for the hand points. Your insight is appreciated.

    Hi Erik,

    Helper's Hole, like any hole in the aura, can indeed be temporarily
    repaired by a local treatment, either with the 2-7 yrs program or the Scar/
    Whiplash treatment, however if the cause is not addressed it will soon
    return.

    The correlation with pancreatic cancer is correct.

    Ozaliet as a remedy for holes is incorrect, this remedy strengthens the
    aura, but doesn't repair holes. For this you should use Fringed Violet. But
    again, as long as the cause, which lies in behavioural and thinking
    patterns, it will not go beyond symptom treatment.

Toxoplasmosis - Sharing of an Experience

Barbaralee
September 2013 edited September 2013 in Interesting Cases Flag
An amazing story I wanted to share with you:

Client:
A single mother (32) struggling with depression, anxiety, fatigue came to see
me last week. 

Measurement - multiple drops on: 
Large Intestine, 
Veins, 
Circulation, 
Kidneys, 
Spleen, 
Adrenals 

Medication:
Zoloft 
(I feel the lack of drops on other endocrine points (Thyroid, Pituitary,
Parathyroid etc.) could be due to the suppression by Zoloft)

Treatment:
According to protocol

Second Session (today)

Measurement - more drops showing on: 
Lymphatic System - Toxoplasmosis
Lungs - Coxsackie
Intestines (Small and Large) - Toxoplasmosis
Nervous System - Toxoplasmosis
Triple Warmer - Toxoplasmosis

Because her cat has been acting funny (sick) for a long time, just on a whim, I
put Toxoplasmosis into the slot and began to measure again. 
All drops cleared except for the Lungs (Coxsackie) 
It was crazy exciting that one remedy could yield such a rich return with nice
strong "YES" sounds.

Footplates:
Support for Kidney, and all detox pathways to help her clear this bug. 

Fingers crossed. Wouldn't it be wonderful to find this lifts the weight of
anxiety and depression she's been under.

She wants to know if I can treat her cats and measure Toxoplasmosis for her two
young daughters. Of course, I know too that even when this clears I still need
to support good intestinal flora growth etc. So we're not out of the woods yet,
but it felt really promising.

    Congratulations Barbara! It sounds like you have found a true cause. 

    When almost all points are corrected by a remedy it is very likely that you
    have found a big causal factor in the illness of a client. 
    With an affinity/resonance to a remedy like you have experienced
    (+confirmation by symptoms and story of the client) it is possible that not
    many treatments are needed anymore after this. 

    Often however, underlying imbalances come to the surface after the body has
    dealt with a more recent infection. The body always shows problems layer by
    layer. 

    But most likely the present symptoms (depression, anxiety, fatigue) will be
    relieved. To stabilise her health, continue to work with what you measure. 

    And keep sharing! It is nice to hear the progress of this story.

    Hi Karolina,

    I've seen Client 4 times. Her mood has improved so that she's actively
    engaged in her life, her kids, and stopped taking Zoloft.

    She returns tomorrow after a long break from treatment. Tonight, I'm
    reviewing her charts and notice that not once has her para-thyroid dropped.
    She also has wet hands and feet that are cold and very red at the tips. the
    points will scream.

    I'm thinking of the notes you gave me regarding the Rheumatoid Arthritis
    clients, and suppression. Perhaps I should give this client a short
    treatment of polio/tetanus too and see if any of her TW points will drop
    other than insulin points. Even though we've had great results with the
    Toxoplasmosis, I believe there are deeper causes I still need to address.

    I'll let you know.

    Because you mentioned to have treated "according to protocol" I didn't
    think about asking whether you had treated with Anti-Tetanus and Polio. If
    you haven't done this yet it is definitely important to do this in the next
    treatment like you suggest.

    The cold and sweaty hands and feet might point to Tuberculinum/Tuberculinum
    Bovinum, so keep these in mind.

    What's been difficult about following protocol has been understanding that
    doesn't mean making the drops the priority but rather just going ahead and
    treating for immunizations even if there are no drops.

    Once, I did that, and put polio into the slot even though there was no drop
    in the pituitary, and later the mother told me she'd never immunized her
    child against polio.

    So its been kind of a rocky road regarding protocol, but I'll get the hang
    of it. Appreciate being able to check in and ask questions like this.

    Part of the measurement protocol is to always treat Poliomyelitis and
    Anti-Tetanus (only these!), IF someone has been vaccinated for them. So I
    usually just ask about vaccination when they are not dropping....

    It is not terrible to have put these Nosodes in by mistake, when there's
    been no vaccination. Within the closed light bio-feedback circuit it won't
    be brought into the body when there's no resonance.

    Questions/Remarks:

    1. Using my refreshed knowledge of protocol, I won't be fooled by the lack
    of drops on the Triple Warmer again. But what is the cause of this? Of
    course if there's no drops one can't automatically say it's a Hidden Spin
    Inversion issue or a Whiplash, but some how I'd completely missed the
    Wndorphin factor even though I've experienced this same endomorph high that
    blocked my drops.

    2. This client has really improved even though I did it WRONG. Thank
    goodness she has. She's very happy with the change in her moods and
    attitude. I'm hoping to help her even further to feel great. But when she
    returned this week, once again those 3 very important points on the Triple
    Warmer DID NOT Drop.

    3. I put Polio and Anti-Tetanus into the slots to measure against. Still no
    drops on the Triple Warmer besides a funky little drop on the Adrenal.

    4. But when I put in Atropinum and Plumbum and Viscum into the remedy slots
    and measured again VOILA'.
    Points fell! That was so interesting. Now we were really getting somewhere.
    I hope!

    Symptoms:
    Constipation
    Circulatory issues (cold hands feet) => suspect calcium metabolism issues. 
    Sneezing constantly => we suspect she's allergic to George (her cat), and
    maybe down pillows comforter, but she can't part with George, but she is
    going to move the pillows and comforter out if we can't get her allergies
    figured out.

    Measurements:

    Pituitary 
    Parathyroid 
    Adrenal (L)
    Lymphatic System (L) - 1 point
    Large Intestine (L) - nail point
    Heart (L) - nail point
    Small Intestine (L) - 1 drop 

    Pineal
    Lung (R) - 2 points
    Nervous System (R) - 1 points
    Circulation (R) - 3 points
    Heart (R) - 2 points
    Small Intestine (R) - 3 drops

    Gallbladder (L) - 2 points
    Stomach (L) - 1 points

    Gallbladder (R) - 1 point
    Liver (R) - 2 points
   
    Question:
    5. My client informs me that she drinks some alcoholic beverage everyday.
    Is this why the liver drops or is it unrelated. I notice some of my younger
    clients whose liver never drop, have drops after drinking and then coming
    to see me?

    >12 Years Program:
    Poliomyelitis, Anti-tetanus, Pertussis, Tonsillitis, Sinusitis, Periproctic
    Abcess, Calculi Bil

    Footplates:
    Atropinum Viscum, Cerebrum Thalamus, Aesculus, Barijodeel, Chelidonium,
    Calcoheel. Half way I put in Ubichinon, Selenium, Berberis

    I dont know why your are using Thalamus,viscum and cerebrum on footplates,
    when johan wrote this:

    JohanBoswinkelJohanBoswinkel February 13
    I think I haven't communicated it well to my trainers or they might have
    misunderstood.

    My way of teaching and the protocol didn't change. Viscum, Thalamus and
    Cerebrum  were only part of the Dyslexia treatment, this hasn't changed is
    was always intended just for Dyslexia...

    This confusion has been caused, because the Dyslexia Program was also used
    on the adults at the end of their session, but this remedy combination was
    never intended for people who don't have Dyslexia.

    I hope on this forum I can clarify more of these misunderstandings, that
    became common amongst practitioners in the last years.

    Hi Peter,

    The Measurement Protocol provided to the May 2012 class in Walnut Creek
    states, "For the clients first session, which has the hormonal system as
    its main focus, you can us Viscum, Thalamus and Cerebrum on the footplates
    to support he recovery of pineal gland, pituitary gland and the nervous
    system." 

    Although this was not my clients 1st session with me, it was HER 1st
    session with immunizations in the hand rods, hence.....I gave her this
    support as dictated by the protocol.

    Now, this does not mean that I will put this in again unless of course, I
    ran multiple immunizations or did intensive work on her nervous system.

    Thanks for your feedback.

    Hi Barbara,

    This suggestion in the measurement protocol was given to prevent things
    from turning into a black and white topic, since many practitioners use
    these remedies (Viscum, Thalamus, Cerebrum), and they are good support
    remedies for certain circumstances. I have experienced that often what is
    written/said can be taken out of context and I wanted to give an
    alternative to just saying "NO don't use them on the Footplates".
    It was my attempt to provide information on why you might want to use them
    the first treatment or when the need for support with these remedies is
    shown in your measurement, but that it doesn't make any sense to use them
    all the time while there's no problem with the Hormone System or Nervous
    System. Support should always reflect what you treat.

    Biontology unfortunately doesn't have recipes. That makes explaining it a
    very complicated thing. I do the best I can...

    To get back to your first November 13th post...

    Comments/Answers: 

    1. "Of course if there's no drops one can't automatically say it's a Hidden
    Spin Inversion issue or a Whiplash..."
    This is a misunderstanding...
    A Hidden Spin Inversion does not show itself through a lack of drops. It is
    called a Hidden Spin Inversion because there is no clue whatsoever in your
    measurements that point toward the Spin Inversion, but after treatment
    you'll find that none of the drops were corrected...
    Whiplash doesn't show itself in a lack of drops either... usually this
    causes a lot of drops. You are right that sometimes Endorphins can be
    created by a Whiplash, but any severe stressful condition can do this. So
    an Endorphin mask is not a clue for Whiplash.

    2. "This client has really improved even though I did it WRONG"
    Symptom improvement can happen, and usually does happen when a client is
    treated by the Chiren/Chikey, even though the Self Healing ability
    (Pituitary is a major factor in this) is not corrected. The problem with
    symptom improvement through Chiren therapy without addressing the
    underlying imbalance, is that a client usually completely falls back over
    time or needs continuing treatments for a very long time.

    3. "I put Polio and Anti-Tetanus into the slots to measure against. Still
    no drops on the Triple Warmer besides a funky little drop on the Adrenal."
    Because Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus are the issues that are masked,
    putting them in the slots will not cause the Pituitary and Parathyroid to
    drop, unless other factors like Whiplash or Variolinum are disturbing these
    glands too. The remedies might relax and unmask these organs by addressing
    the very stressful issues, but at the same time they are the remedies to
    correct these imbalances! The "net result" will be balanced points...
    However if you would measure all other points again, sometimes other drops
    suddenly appear after putting Anti-Tetanus and Poliomyelits in.

    4. "But when I put in Atropinum and Plumbum and Viscum into the remedy
    slots and measured again VOILA"
    Proof there were Endorphins, yes!

    # "we suspect she's allergic to George (her cat), and maybe down pillows
    comforter"
    Allergies are a symptom. Affected mucous membranes are the underlying cause
    and you'll need to find out what is causing this. "Nasal allergies" are
    usually caused by either Food Poisonings or Streptococcus/Staphylococcus
    bacteria. Since you also find Lung, Heart and Lymphatic System dropping it
    is likely Strep or Staph.

    5. "My client informs me that she drinks some alcoholic beverage everyday.
    Is this why the liver drops or is it unrelated."
    When the alcohol intake is not excessive it is very unusual to see this
    reflected in measurements of the Liver. If this correlation is truly there
    for this client it means a very weak Liver... 
    It is about the underlying cause again.

    Karolina, in your response to toxoplasmosis being measured
     "With an affinity/resonance to a remedy like you have experienced
    (+confirmation by symptoms and story of the client) it is possible that
    not many treatments are needed anymore after this."

    Could you please elaborate on your experience/thoughts on treatment of
    long-term toxoplasmosis infection.
    I understand that we still have to assist a body to heal based on what a
    body will "tell us", but in terms of the parasite itself, how long does it
    take (6 weeks of the cycle?) for the body to eliminate the parasite itself
    and how often we have to use remedy even though we might not be able to
    measure toxoplasmosis  itself (because it usually very systemic)...  I
    understand that it might be a long term recovery with recovering the damage
    of the body and the parasite itself simultaneously (The diseased tree and
    the bug analogy).

    Thank you.

    I measure Toxoplasmosis frequently, often in combination with
    Appendicitis. Usually I then do not measure it again the next session.

    My experience is that when parasites disappear from the blood/tissue often
    symptoms remain, and also that all symptoms can be gone when the parasites
    are still there. This is why I seriously doubt if there should be so much
    focus on the parasite itself. My personal experience in treating clients
    shows that there is no need for it and that you need far less treatments
    when your focus is on the underlying weakness of the body.

    The main focus should always be on the Terrain and the Meridians. When
    there's no disturbance measured that needs the remedy Toxoplasmosis there's
    less benefit to it than using a nosode that actually does match.Ultimately
    it is the body that needs to heal itself, and if necessary, get rid of
    disturbing parasites. 
    For the body to have that discerning and eliminating capacity the Meridians
    and thus Organ Systems need to function optimally.

    It is also difficult to determine whether the symptoms your client has are
    caused by Toxoplasmosis, since other infections have similar symptoms (as
    you will find in the new Remedy Book). Usually when there's one infection
    there are more since it is the failing immune function of the body that is
    the underlying cause.
   
    So the main focus should always be on the meridians.Treating in the right
    sequence and with enough time in between sessions for the body to act on
    the treatment is also very important.

    I agree that when you don't measure the Toxoplasmosis itself anymore you
    don't need to use it. Only when it then appears back in measurement it is
    something the body needs to pay attention to again.

    Here's a little (unedited) taste of the new Remedy-Book I have been working
    on. It would be interesting to know if you find many of the more specific
    indications of Toxoplasmosis matching. 
    Of course many indications you will find with other infections too, since
    they just reflect the nature of an infection in general.

    the first half of the book with all kinds of corrections, notes, questions

What is a Miasm?

judyth
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Definitions Flag
I'm confused about what is a Miasm.  The Miasms we have in the Chiren that I am
aware of are Lymes, and Trichomonas.  

Are Tuberculinum and Luesinum also Miasms?  Are there more?   Does this have
implications for their use?  I have heard they need to be "fixed" with
something else - is this so?  I did go online to read about Miasms - that
confused me more.  Thanks judyth

    By the looks of it there's a lot of misinformation going around about
    Miasms. 

    Miasms are part of a theory Hahnemann (founder of Homeopathy) came up with,
    when he found that results in clients with Chronic Diseases were not
    lasting. He did a lot of research and concluded that there were several
    diseases that have been around and were suppressed for such a long time
    that they have become part of the constitution of every person and formed
    the Fundament for Illness. He named them Miasms.
    These Miasms were viewed as the Fundamental, Underlying Cause of all
    Chronic Conditions or Diseases.

    The biggest and most important Miasm is the Psoric Miasm (remedy Psorinum)
    caused by the suppression of Skin Diseases. Then there are the Miasms of
    Venereal Diseases: the Syphylitic Miasm (remedy Leusinum) and the Sycotic
    Miasm -root cause Gonorrhoea- (remedy Medorrhinum). Also there's the TB
    Miasm (remedy Tuberculinum) and nowadays Cancer (remedy Carcinosinum) is
    considered a Miasm by many Homeopaths too, but this is not something that
    originated from Hahnemann.

    Lyme's and Trichomonaden are definitely not Miasms!

    We can use the Miasms in Therapy because they are potent Nosodes, but other
    than that we don't follow any ideas about them (how often and with what
    other remedies etc.).... We are not Homeopaths. 

    So if you measure one of the Miasms is needed, that's wonderful, you can
    use it. If a Miasm has indications for Symptoms your client has, you can
    use it in that way... If something is "holding a disease in place" you can
    try the Miasm that is "blamed" for that disease.... This is all fine, but
    don't create too much ideas around them. And if they don't do what they
    promised... don't continue to used them many times. Look for another
    Cause...

    This is exactly what i am dealing with right now. As some of you know, I am
    a 59 year old woman with (had?) Hepatitis C. 

    I found, early on in my learning, that I had Medorrhinum and Luesinum and
    Trichomonaden a lot. I consistently gave myself a treatment to get rid of
    it, and it took quite a few sessions. I had the Trichomonaden in several
    places, usually in conjunction with the miasms, but also whenever Saturn,
    the planet, was playing havoc with my astrological chart. I know this
    because I spent about 6 months speaking to an astrologer and it always
    appeared when my chart was unfavourable to me. 

    Then all of it basically disappeared and I could get on with healing myself
    with whatever nosodes I still needed. Now that most of my systems are
    cleaned up, the miasms have returned in a big way. This time, no
    Trichomonaden, just the venereal diseases. These all appear in my three
    children on the exact days that they do in me, including in my daughter in
    Sweden (I am in Canada). I know, because I test them). 

    On those days when my chart is not good, or there is bad energy around, my
    bowels twist and interestingly I feel no thirst, which is not normal for
    me. I have wanted to talk about this research that I have been doing for
    the past while, and this opportunity seemed to be the best time to bring it
    up. I am now thinking, or hoping, that this current blast of miasm energy
    is the final ancestral remnants that my family is actually detoxing and
    that we (my children have hep c too) will come out the other side clean and
    clear. By the way, my chart for the next 6 months says that it will be the
    most transformational of my life!   Jennifer, Toronto

    Hi Jen,

    Several comments, since I think you weren't trained by Johan on this
    subject and like I wrote, there are a lot of misunderstandings around this
    subject.

    Trichomonaden is not a Miasm! It was never suppressed like the other
    diseases that created Miasms and has not become an underlying disturbance. 
    Johan has tested Trichomonaden for a long time since in measurements and
    theory it seemed to be helpful with recurrent Appendicitis. He thought it
    was at the base of this and he had heard from a Russian scientist who
    believed it was at the base of Cancer too. You can measure it frequently in
    people, but since it comes back every time and doesn't solve the problem it
    has shown to not be the effective remedy Johan was looking for. It is now
    no longer used by him.
    Every remedy that you have to keep repeating that long is not the Cause...
    and you have to look beyond that.
    Even Psorinum, the Master of Miasms we only use once in Therapy Resistance
    and then if it doesn't solve the problem, we continue and try to find
    another Cause.... It might sometimes not be a remedy that is needed, but a
    change in environment, dental work, job, attitude..... etc.

    When you say you measure the Miasms in different places every time, I
    really like to ask you what your (and your children's) Symptoms are and how
    they are directly affected by the treatment with these Miasms. 

    Miasm theory is still evolving and nowadays there are even Homeopaths that
    would suggest that Hepatitis C is a Miasm..... So in this respect, the Hep
    A non B would be more effective as a nosode for you than the other
    "Miasms". 

    I'm an Astrologer too and if it is Saturn that is affecting you so much, I
    would think of Psorinum before all the others. Because if there was any
    Miasm that reflects Saturn's essence it is Psora. 

    But Saturn in Chinese medicine would be Metal. And when there's a heavy
    Metal energy that affects Wood through the Controlling Cycle in the Five
    Element System, you can get Gallbladder/Liver trouble. (twisting of Bowles
    is one)
    A Wood element (Liver/Gallbladder) that is disturbed will automatically
    have problems with structure, reality, responsibilities, (negative)
    feedback, rules etc. This is all Saturn stuff.

    When Saturn effects you heavily each time you feel it's influence, dealing
    with earthly reality is hard for you, and this might be a Cause. Lack of:
    encouragement, acknowledgement for ones individuality, adventure, freedom
    to explore life, physical activity, humour, creativity in youth... all can
    weaken a positive flow of Wood energy that can withstand the harshness of
    reality.
    On the other hand a lack of or too much structure, sense of reality,
    responsibility, discrimination, holding on to ideas and things, materialism
    (all Metal) in the upbringing can also cause a similar imbalance. 

    Do you have or had Intestinal problems? 

    Anyway, if I were you, and with the little information I have, I would
    focus on your Liver/Gallbladder (Wood) and Lung/Large Intestines (Metal)
    and not be too distracted by Miasms.

    Hello Karolina, Thank you so much for your thoughtful response. My first
    training was with Paul McDonald and W, which is where I learned about
    Trichomonaden and Miasms. Last year, when I found Trichomonaden, it was on
    my hormonal system, Large Intestine and Bladder. I treated it and haven't
    found it since. 

    I just recently found the Miasms in conjunction with the need for
    Causticum, Solaris Essence and or Space Clearing Essence on me, my family
    and many of my clients - perhaps a bout of solar storms? 

    As for my Hepatitis C, I have more or less cleared my Gallbladder, Large
    Intestine and Liver of the need for nosodes. I had to systematically go
    through Appendicitis Necrotis, Chronic and Appendicitis, and all three
    levels in the Gallbladder, Gallstones and Circulation too. All Hepatitis
    nosodes including Zhirrhosis were clear on me before Christmas, so I am
    basically on my way to excellent health. 

    My Liver often reads low in energy and sometimes I still find Appendicitis
    there. Not sure why? I can actually put my hand on my abdomen over the
    Appendix area, and still feel some "action" and bulging that probably
    shouldn't be there. 
    Question: What are the best support remedies for me in order to heal a very
    (no doubt) scarred Liver and scarred Gallbladder and Liver Ducts? 

    I don't want to take a blood test until I am more confident that I will
    find the "virus" gone or at least dramatically reduced. Since my children
    also have it, it is my life's ambition to heal us as a family. This is, of
    course, inspiration for me to help others as my journey has been
    fascinating and I want to share my knowledge.

    By the way, your description of Metal and Wood was very interesting and I
    found myself in many of those adjectives and circumstances. Thank you
    again, Jennifer

    Jennifer: The training you got was an unsupervised training, that didn't
    originate from the IABS and the trainer was never properly trained herself
    or guided by Johan unfortunately. I don't like to go into the politics of
    it, but I must urge you to read the forum thoroughly to get rid of some
    ideas around Biontology that were taught wrongly.

    I know in this training there was a lot of attention for measurement, which
    is the foundation of your Biontology skills, so at least you got that out
    of it. But the theory is not all reliable...

    Appendicitis affecting Liver => Metal affecting Wood!

    Scarred Liver/Gallbladder ducts = Liver/Gallbladder Cirrhosis, so to treat
    this you can just continue to treat with these Nosodes (Zirrhose Hepatis,
    Billiary Cirrhosis). Even if you don't measure for it anymore, the Physical
    Symptoms still need this Remedies.. that is if the Scars are still there.
    Do you know that for sure?
    Procrainum for Internal Scar Tissue is also helpful.

    Thanks for an interesting discussion, glad to know I just treat these like
    any Nosode. I don't have much information on Luesinium (in the Chiren it is
    on the Triple Warmer and the Bladder meridians).

    Another thought I'm having-when an area of stress-eg: a muscle that has
    been tight for a long time Gallbladder)  releases there is often a skin
    outbreak( postules, rash)  Would this be a time one might use Psorium to
    clear suppressions in that area?

    It depends what kind of Postules...

    Postules are generally a way of the body to get Toxins as far away from the
    Vital Organs as is possible.

    Often this is a Symptom that indicates Kidney Insufficiency, sometimes it
    could indeed be Psorinum or Variolinum (Herpes, Shingles).

Remedy Dosages, Combos and Contraindications

kathrynhowardkathrynhoward
February 2013 edited February 2013 in Biontology Insights Flag
Q#1: I think I heard Johan say that the 10-minute treatment provides
low-, medium- and high-remedy dosages, and the body accepts the one it
needs. 
Question: How to download high-quality homeopathic remedies with dosages all
the way from low up to 100M. Which dosage
is best to download? 


Q#2: In the new manual, do you list the remedies that
should not be used together in the same treatment, or which ones are good to
follow others - or is that not an issue with the Chiren? For example, some
remedies follow each other - or there should be considerable time in between:
Ignatia after Nux vomica, etc. And complementary remedies: Apis and Natrium;
China and Ferrum; Medorrhinum and Sulphur; Phos and Carbo - as some examples
that work together well.? I have a feeling this is a stupid question, but am
asking anyway!
Thank you.

    Hi Kathryn,

    First of all, thank you for posting your question here. There are NO stupid
    questions...

    Regarding your questions:

    Q#1: I think you combine two different aspects of the Chiren in one here.

    1. The adult hand-treatment has a five-steps program that in the first step
    only allows the lower frequencies to go through. With every sequence higher
    frequencies are added. The last step has no filter and lets everything go
    through.

    Because there’s confusion about what we treat with and this explanation
    about the filtered frequencies can add to that, here’s some additional
    information: The Chiren treats with information, however this information
    travels on frequencies, these are not the same. Higher frequencies have
    affinity with more subtle information and lower frequencies with more dense
    /material information.
    So it is true that in the first step only the low potency homeopathic
    remedies come through and in the last one also the highest ones.

    2. Regarding the low, medium and high potencies you're referring to, this
    has nothing to do with the hand treatment.
    Johan prepared the nosode remedies in the Chiren all in the same
    combination: D12, D30 and D200 (in the US homeopathic system this would be
    12X, 30X and 200X)

    The C and M system is the French system that is not used in Germany. Johan
    has found, when he initially started to research the effectiveness of
    remedies in his instrument, that the German system and its remedies is far
    superior to the C and M remedy system. The C's and M's are prepared in a
    different way (100 times diluting) and this makes the quality of the
    information less effective.

    So it is best to use the D12, D30, D200 and D1000 if you want to load new
    remedies.

    If you really want to add 100M remedies you can of course do so, however it
    is best first to research their effectiveness and to do so there’s only one
    way. Test them separately.
    You can put just this one remedy in a short hand-treatment and do nothing
    else, then observe the next days how it changes the symptoms/illness. When
    you repeat this several times and it has the same effect you’ll know that
    you have an effective remedy. This is the only reliable way to test what a
    remedy does, since the standard protocol has many effects on all levels,
    which shows up differently in every client. It is impossible to, after a
    treatment, separate the results you would have gotten using just the
    protocol, from the results that are solely due to your new remedy.

    Another thing with remedies is that some remedies can show a lot of
    corrections when you measure, but in reality when you use them don’t seem
    as potent and effective as the measurements would make you believe. This
    can be because the type of information matches, but the remedy has a low
    quality, it can be because the information fits, but this kind of remedy
    needs frequent repetition in small doses, it can be because it would change
    something on a subtle level if you were just a subtle being without a
    body…. who knows, but the reality is that a remedy can mask drops without
    doing much.
    This is also the reason why it took Johan a long time to find remedies that
    really worked and use them in a way that is most effective, and also the
    reason why enthusiastic claims about new remedy experiments are not
    immediately accepted by Johan, since he knows probably none of those
    remedies have been tested in this way. Seperately…

    Q#2: For the homeopath this is very important, for us Biontologists not
    that much, since we re-measure every remedy, that we have measured to be
    effective on an organ and because of this we can also see when it loses its
    effectiveness. (this is why the remedies should all stay in the slots
    during measurement)
    After every session we can see that all organ systems are corrected, so
    even if some remedies have cancelled each other out there was still an
    effective treatment. Most of the supportive remedies have many single
    homeopathic remedies in them and if we would take in consideration the
    canceling effect of one single remedy in a compositum, on a single remedy
    in another compositum, it would make a very difficult puzzle to solve….
    The fact that remedies can disturb each others effectiveness is however
    good to realize because it again shows us that we have to be careful not to
    use too many different things at the same time.

Internal Scars

janjan
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Programs Flag
Question:
1. I want to make sure that I understood correctly that the remedy for internal
scars is Procranium?

2. For which internal scars is it most appropriate? Would it be for a Colon
resection or laproscopy or Ovary removal? 

3. Do you give it with the two Glass Rods over the area of the scar and
Procranium in the remedy slot, or use the the Blue and Orange wires with Pads?
Or do you give it in the Remedy slot with the Standard Program for Internal
Scars.

    I have the same question, because of a client who had Gastric Bypass. I
    would also like to know if and how I should use Procranium for this client.

    I have used the Rods on the External Scars => placed one Rod on her back
    and one on the abdomen, where I thought the internal scar would be.

    I don't know how deep therods penetrate so I don't know if the Scar was
    affected.

    For Internal Scars the Scar Program should be used with the Glass Rods. 

    The blue and orange wires (electricity) is best for direct contact with the
    Scar (so on the Skin), the Metal Wires don't penetrate deep enough.

    The only Remedy I use for Internal Scars is Procranium. This can be put in
    de slot during the Scar Program, but also during the Standard Treatment.

    Just to make it a little more clear:

    * If someone is treated when not in Spin Inversion, but then a Spin
    Inversion occurs somewhere after the session the healing initiated by that
    session will stop.

    * If someone is treated when in Spin Inversion, the treatment at best is
    ineffective and at worst may have a negative effect, as the body reacts the
    wrong way to any treatment. 

    For this reason Spin Inversion is really something to be aware of and to
    treat it the right way without masking (with blood or saliva!)

October 2015 - pH Regulation

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
October 2015 edited October 2015 in Q&A Flag
Questions
I remember that you once said that the Gallbladder and Pancreas are crucial in
the Acid-Base regulation system of the body.

1. Can you elaborate on how this mechanism works and the functions of the
organs in the regulation process from the perspective of Biontology.

2. What are the probable causes of the malfunction of this regulation mechanism
and the possible effects on the body system?

3. What is the most accurate way to measure the pH level of the body?

Answers
1. I do not remember saying this, but if I did mention the Gallbladder and
Pancreas, this must have been in a food and drink related context, and most
likely because of a question about the Alkaline diet, which I consider popular
nonsense. The body itself creates huge pH fluctuations throughout the digestive
system. Normal food intake will not directly cause any disruption to the
internal environment. Whenever the regulatory systems are OK, the cellular
environment will be OK too. 

Within the digestive system, everything that enters the body is transformed. In
the Stomach the food is exposed to acid, but when it then goes to the Duodenum
it is exposed to bile and pancreatic juices, which make it alkaline. This is
probably why I mentioned the Gallbladder and the Pancreas in relation to the
alkaline diet. As long as your regulatory system functions, all is transformed
and excreted as needed. And because the acid and base secretion and the
re-uptake of involved ions in the Intestines are balanced, there will be no
effect on acidity in the bloodstream. A problem appears when diarrhea or enemas
flush the ions out of the Intestines before they can be absorbed. This leads to
acidity of the blood, whereas vomiting causes a lack in acid and leads to
excess alkalinity.

In the blood, however, the pH is usually kept within a narrow range by other
organ systems. The Lungs help maintain a balance by expelling CO2, which is
acidic, and the Kidneys excrete other acidic substances like uric acid.
Non-gaseous acids are excreted by the Kidneys only. If the Kidneys do not
excrete enough acids, they will be stored in the tissues and depending on where
they are dumped, will give rheumatic and arthritic symptoms.

The main thing to remember is that the body itself creates such enormous
amounts of acids and bases continuously, that the amount that comes in through
food and drink is negligible. Examples are lactic acid created in the muscles
and uric acid created by cellular break down.

Correcting the functions of the body through normal Biontology sessions, in my
experience, will solve problems of acidity or alkalinity in the tissues
automatically.

2. As mentioned before, the most likely issue of over-acidity or
over-alkalinity IF caused by the digestive system is vomiting or diarrhea which
inhibits the reuptake of acids and bases that are normally released by the
Stomach, Pancreas and Gallbladder.

Other, and more likely, causes of tissue or blood acidity are Kidney
malfunction or breathing abnormalities. Yet another cause of acidity is the
excessive release of ketones during the break down of fats, which can be
related to extreme low-carb diets or diabetes.

But I wonder why you are interested in this at all, because hardly anyone will
have insight in their pH level throughout the body. The pH is different
everywhere, and there are no tests available that will give a reliable picture
of the pH regulation. 

3. There is none. The pH is and should be different in different systems of the
body.

    Typically the water that come to us through the pipes and filters (as far

    Is there any value in drinking Alkaline water, and if so how much?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    October 2015 Flag
    Answer
    I don't see any value in it. The body's own regulation processes as
    described above are far more important than whatever you take in through
    food or drink (e.g. water).

    If you want to reduce tissue acidity you need to focus on Kidney function
    and proper breathing habits.

    It would make sense that high intake of alkaline water would tax the
    stomach acid levels leading to low stomach acid, similar to what a junk
    diet may do.

Different Sounds - What do they Mean

    My Chiren had a very different sound than the other students in Canada.
    Wendy B. said it was the old Starlight sound used in my Chiren. 

    When I heard the other Chirens (so many were in my hotel room that night
    when we downloaded the 22 cards in Walnut Creek), they all sounded
    extremely low to me. It was a surprise. It is obvious to me when there is a
    drop, because the sound is high to begin with and drops immediately. So, if
    I sometimes get that high Starlight sound screeching higher instead of
    dropping, am I probing incorrectly, or is there an infection? 

    Perhaps I am misunderstanding about infections and sounds? Why would it not
    drop instead of rise if someone has an infection? I am also confused about
    the line graph on the screen. Sometimes they are very low and other times
    they are way up on top. Sometimes they are wide apart and sometimes they
    are very close together and spike up and down from the top to the bottom.
    I don't remember that this was covered in any course or in CA in December. 

    Could you please explain this for clarification? I have looked through all
    the manuals, but I can't find anything that explains these lines in the
    graph above the green/red color bars and what they actually means.
    Appreciate clarification. 

    Thank you. Kathryn

    different Chirens vary, but this has nothing to do with the Starlight.

    Since your Chiren already makes higher sounds than others and "screaming
    sounds" were mistakenly taught in class, it might be that you have been
    focussing too much on this. 

    Since the hight of the sound has a lot to do with skin conductivity, I
    don't use this as a diagnostic tool. Too many factors play a role in
    creating high sounds to draw conclusions based on them.

    The only diagnostic factor to focus on is whether a sound drops or not. A
    point that drops shows biophoton incoherence, which shows disease. Then you
    measure what remedies can balance the organs connected to the dropping
    points. So don't get sidetracked by the graph, spikes, bars etc.

    Thank you Johan. I never felt the the graph, spikes, bars, etc., were
    important and never used them. I only began to wonder when several people
    brought this up during various classes we have done with the videophone. I
    am glad to know that the way I have always done it is correct! I remember
    you teaching this so clearly about the sound drops being the most important
    diagnostic tool, but then I thought perhaps I had missed something when it
    was mentioned. Good to validate when one is working properly!

Sleep Apnea, Hives, IUD's

DennisOwensDennisOwens
September 2013 edited January 2014 in Medication Flag
I am a new practitioner and have a few basic question which I am unable to find
answers for in the U. S. Manual or Heel Manual.

 1. One woman age 52 has been using breathing strips on her nose to prevent her
    sleep apnea and want to know if there is any way of addressing this issue
    thorough Biophoton work.
 2. Another younger woman is considering getting an IUD and wants to know if it
    might interfere with Biophoton work and if she should hold off getting it
    until after she completes treatment.
 3. Is there any known remedy for Hives and on which meridian(s) might I look
    for that disturbance.

    Your sleep apnea client might find a whiplash treatment helpful.

    While it is acceptable for a person with an IUD to receive Chiren
    treatments, there are other reasons why, in my opinion, an IUD is best
    avoided.

    Regarding the hives: Check the skin meridian on the feet for Causticum
    (contains histamine), Apis, Cuitis , Graphites, Psorinum, Mezereum,
    Nervoheel (contains zinc). 

    Placenta, circulo, aesculus may be measured on the circulation meridian.

    Hives can also be caused by toxins like formaldehyde & insecticides (check
    lungs, nervous system, skin for both and possibly stomach for
    insecticides).  Also food poisoning (large intestine left hand).  Galium or
    other detox support may measure on the liver and organ degeneration
    meridian.

    And always remember to make sure the kidneys are happy.  :)

    IUD leaves me in the dark on what you are talking about. Consider always
    that we are people from many countries in the forum, not just US.
    Therefore self created or other abbreviations that are not so easily read
    should be a no go. 

    If you want to shorten words or medical terms then explain them one time
    and use the shorten word there after.

    Best regards ond have a nice weekend :)

    Hi Peter,

    IUD is short for Intra-Uterine-Device. In the Netherlands, when I would
    translate literally, it is called spiral. It is a contraceptive device that
    is placed into the uterine and may or may not contain hormones.

    I agree with Renate that it is very damaging to the female body, but it is
    not a contradiction for treatment.

    Hi Dennis,

    1. Whiplash should be looked for for sure, because this can have a huge
    effect on breathing. The carotid body which is the checkpoint of the body
    for arterial blood composition (especially CO2/O2 levels) is located on
    both sides of the throat, so a disturbance like Whiplash in the area of the
    neck can cause abnormalities in the regulation of breathing. Whiplash is
    also involved in asthma.

    But since you're a new student I also like to emphasis that there's no
    recipe or answer that always fits one condition. Sometimes other issues
    might be causing sleep apnea (=long pauses of not breathing during sleep)
    too. Always continue to be open to other possible answers and measure,
    measure, measure.... ;-)

    Thanks for your response, and my apologies to Peter for not explaining IUD.
    I understand the reasons for not using IUD's but am anticipating that my
    client will want to know what I recommend as a substitute.

    My Catholic parents used the rhythm method and had 7 children !!! ;) so I
    don't think I'll be recommending that.

    Wondering what the Biontology point of view is on this? :)]

    Very difficult one Dennis,... The least harmful anti-conception method for
    the woman, that still is very reliable, is the condom. Not very
    man-friendly though... and there are unnatural substances in condoms too.

    An option Johan always mentions is following the personal moon-cycle in
    combination with the ovulation cycle. 
    This means that the 3 days surrounding the time in the month when the sun
    and moon of the woman make the same angle as when she was born she should
    avoid sex, as well as the 3 days surrounding the ovulation. Most rhythm
    methods only take into account the ovulation and not the sun and moon... 
   
    Proof for this method can be found on the internet if you google on
    Professor Jonas from Czechoslovakia and astrological birth control. He did
    some very interesting research on this in the 70's.

    In my experience with treating woman with anti-conception in the form of a
    small pil are fine, they are not disturbing the measurements or have
    influence on the hormonal system.

    A small pill won't block the Chiren treatment, but even if you don't find
    it disturbing in the measurements this doesn't necessarily mean that it is
    not disturbing to the bodily system.

    Health of a woman, before menopause has set in, shows in a healthy
    reproductive cycle and fertility. This is normal, healthy functioning and
    to mess with any of the natural functions of the body is to mess with its
    overal health and ability to self-regulate (at least in the long run)

    So unfortunately other ways have to be found when you really want to work
    with the body and restore its natural abilities to an optimum. Condoms
    unfortunately are usually not embraced as happily as the pill.

    This doesn't mean that Chiren treatment can't have results when the pill is
    taken of course, usually results are fine. But when you bring balance and
    then stop treating, this small pill over time can cause new disease.

A client of mine recently purchased a Chikey from Germany and also purchased
several of the pre-programmed remedy cards.
Could you provide a listing of what remedies were used to create these cards 
She has asked me to program several other cards for her. I have listed below
what they are intended for and remedies I am proposing to program. 
I would appreciate any suggestions on instructing the frequency of use and
which programs would be appropriate.

 1. Stress 
     1. Calm and Clear
     2. Meditation essence
     3. Atropinum
 2. Energy
     1. Aesculus

    From your suggested card remedies I can say the following:

    When only treating symptoms there might be no lasting relief. It is OK to
    treat symptoms with the Chikey, but it is better to address the cause
    especially since these cards are for your client, who you have measured and
    treated before. With the right assessment and instructions for use it is
    more than OK to create personalised Chikey cards with nosodes.

    For cold and flu symptoms it is more effective to use nosodes like the food
    poisonings or the Strep and Staph. It also makes a difference if the cold
    is in the sinuses or in the throat.

    The sequence of treatment should always be a maximum of once every 5 days.

    Other points of attention per card:

    Stress card => one needs to look at life style as well.
    Energy card => why Causticum, and why Aesculus? There are far better energy
    remedies in the Chiren, like Tonico and China.
    Cold & Flu card => remedies like Belladonna, Echinacea are not very
    effective for colds and flu symptoms. You better use Mucosa and Natrium
    Homaccord.

    I have asked Monika to send me the remedies on the pre-programmed cards and
    will post this when I receive the answer.

    If you create cards for your own clients you can also use nosodes according

    Is your recommendation not to use more than one card a time pertains only
    to above mentioned cards or to any cards, even created by Biontologist?

    When I write a ChiKey schedule for my clients I ask them to use 2 cards as
    a session, once a week. Example: program 1 - Calcification card and program
    4 - Kidney card.

    Thank you.

    These are standard cards that are distributed to the general public of whom
    some have never been treated with the Chiren or Starlight before. So that
    is why it is important to be careful. People generally have a huge tendency
    to overdo things anyway...
   
    When a trained Biontologist like you uses the cards as a substitute for a
    weekly session, of course it is more than OK to create 1 card for the adult
    program + 1 card for the footplate program. Just as long as all is in line
    with the protocol. So only use those nosodes that work on the treatment
    layers the client is ready for (especially don't treat the Liver or Metals/
    Toxins too soon) and do not use too many nosodes or too little focussed
    supports.

    In the example above
    If a client using a Chikey does not have the footplates, would it be ok to
    substitute the hand rods and place them under the feet for use with Program
    4? or would it make sense to run Program 4 through the hands as the second
    part of the treatment?

    Thank You.

    The Dyslexia program is designed to go through the feet. Running the
    program with the hand rods will not have the same effect.

    The surface of contact is also important and the glass rods are too small.

    What do you recommend for people who want to use Program  4 when they
    travel and do not want to carry the footplates?

    What do you think of placing the rods on each side of the hips?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    May 2015 edited May 2015 Flag
    I am sorry but I do not have any advise for this situation. The Dyslexia
    program is designed for the Footplates and should not be done without them.

    The way you suggest, putting the rods on the hips, you will not have a
    light flow from the end points on the feet all the way up to the head, and
    this is what is necessary for Dyslexia treatment.
  •

    Thank you.

    Do you think it would be worthwhile to follow program 1, with a support
    card on program 2 with the rods (since she won't have the footplates with
    her)?

    For example, food bacteria on prog 1 and then follow with intestinal
    support on 2?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    May 2015 Flag
    I think this is a good idea, even though it is not the same as using the
    footplates. But the Chikey will never be able to completely replace a
    Biontology session anyway since you cannot measure.

Testing for Multiple Vaccinations/Toxins/Heavy Metals

Jewell
June 2013 edited January 2014 in Measurement Flag
Hello, I'm Jewell
My first post. I'm new and excited, though feeling a little shy but have a
burning question....so here goes.....

Question: 
What is the best way within the protocol to test for Multiple Vaccinations/
Toxins/Heavy Metals

Theoretical Example:
I've measured and it's time to add a remedy and test it's influence on a
particular point let's say.....

Pituitary is dropping.
Add Poliomyelitis. This indicates that it will clear the point. 
 
1. Time to move on? Even though I know the person has multiple vaccinations,
and has had some heavy exposure to toxins and heavy metals?

2. When is the opportunity to test for these other vaccinations and pollutants?
Or, do I test for them at this moment?

3. If so, what is the best way.

I find myself wishing there was a GRAND CENTRAL point in which to test if
certain remedies would be beneficial to the body as a whole, or not.

4: Is there a way to test the general impact of a particular food or substance
or electronic device that may be impacting the body in a positive or negative
way?

I appreciate your time.
Jewell

    Hi Jewel, welcome to the forum!

    1. The body shows its imbalances layer by layer. The biggest disturbers,
    when you consider the Vaccinations, are Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus, and
    they will show up in your first Session.
    Sometimes one of the other Vaccinations might show up in the first Session
    too or in one of the following Sessions. But it is not necessarily so that
    all vaccinations have to appear somewhere along the line of treatment!

    2. The best way is to use your Measurement Protocol, that you have received
    at your initial training. If you follow the right order of addressing the
    different meridians and the right order of remedy testing per meridian, it
    is not likely you will need Heavy Metals in your first treatment.
    Heavy Metals are mostly measured on the Nervous System and Pancreas/Spleen,
    which are Yin Organs. So they don't have a priority in treatment (Yang
    Organs come first!).
   
    3. I understand measuring all points every time creates some frustration,
    which it often does when just starting the Biontology training (ask anyone 
    ;-)), but unfortunately there are no shortcuts and you'll just have to get
    the whole technique and understanding of Biontology and use all points from
    a point of insight that will develop overtime.
    Shortcuts will never deliver the best results..... 
   
    Also your question reveals that you try to work in the opposite way.... you
    have an idea of what might be a problem (e.g. toxins, vaccinations, Heavy
    Metals) and then start looking for a point that it might be measured on.
    But what you should do is measure where there is an imbalance (dropping
    points) and then see what Remedy is needed to balance it... what the body
    "asks" for.
    Do you see the difference? The body is telling what it needs, as opposed to
    you (or the client) thinking what is a problem, and then trying to find a
    point to prove/measure this theory...

    When the overall condition of the body improves it will start detoxing many
    substances, so you don't have to measure/treat every single Toxin one by
    one. Only Causative Toxins (=the ones that create functional disturbances
    which are measurable) need to be treated.

    4. Again it is the other way around that you should think => You find a
    disturbance (dropping points) and then can assess what is the Direct Cause
    (trigger) and Underlying Cause (systemic weakness).
    Food can be a trigger, but is not the underlying cause. Allergies are
    usually caused by Inflammation/Infection of the Digestive Tract (Food
    Poisonings, Appendicitis (Chronic, Necroticans)), but eating the Food
    (trigger) creates the Symptoms. 
    Staying at the level of sensitivities won't resolve the underlying weakness
    of the body, which is the Cause.

    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    June 2013 edited June 2013 Flag
    To search for points where you can test a certain substance opens one to
    the big possibility to start projecting! It is very important to be
    objective in your assessment and not to project, since this can have an
    influence on the outcome of your measurement...

    Measuring is asking the body what is wrong with it and you have to ask each
    body part individually if it is right or malfunctioning. If it is
    malfunctioning, then you can ask that point what is the cause. To find the
    right remedy, you need to ask the body again. But you have to ask the right
    question.

    The reason for the malfunctioning can be many things. There is no general
    cure, and no recipes. Everybody is an individual. You may see a trend but
    the individual causes are often different and you have to find them by
    asking the right questions.

    You only have had the first course. Over time and a lot of practice you
    will learn a lot more.
    When I first started out with my research and practice this is the way I
    got more insight, and this is also the only way you will truly start to
    understand what works and what doesn't:

    * Every time after you have measured, found remedies and treated you need
    to look back. 
    * When a Client has results, you need to look back over your notes and see
    what you have done. 
    * Then you also need to look again to see what points have changed, what
    organs have been improving...
    * Ask yourself the question: "Do the new measurements correspond with the
    changes in the physical body?" 

    Biontology is a study of human beings, and there is nothing more
    complicated than a human being. 
    This is why it needs regular practice and continuous reading up and
    analysing what happens and what has happened. Everything has to be analysed
    in order for your insight to evolve and for your sessions to become more
    focussed and effective, and also to get a higher percentage of lasting
    success and not just random improvements of some symptoms. 

    In due course you learn certain Processes and Correlations between Symptoms
    and Organs, what Sequence things take, in what Sequence the body seems to
    solve things.

    Do not be despaired if things do not go as quickly as you might want. In
    the beginning I took 3 to 4 hours of measuring and treating, all the time
    looking for effects all over the body if I balanced one system. In the
    beginning you need friends and relatives to practice on. During this time
    you learn.

    The Chiren does a lot but not everything. So keep practicing and learning.
    Read all the entries on the forum and you will learn a lot. Do not try to
    read all at once because you cannot absorb everything. Read an hour per
    day.
    And do not think when you read. Try to receive. that way you will learn
    most and quickest. Stay objective

    Good Luck!

    Thanks so much, all your guidance is very helpful, and the Forum is
    extremely helpful in small enough doses.  

    And, yes I always feel great as soon as I just let myself be where I'm at
    in my learning and trust that it is an unfolding process of learning that
    has structure and yet is fluid.....and takes time to learn even though I
    want to already know (ha ha ha!)...partially because it is so
    exciting....fascinating..... and also because I want to be as effective as
    I can. 

    Thanks for your wise words about receiving more than thinking.......your
    time is appreciated.....Jewell


    Karolina:

    Another question that I will try to clarify with an example:

    Take the Pituitary (because this comes first)
   
    It drops => Poliomyelitis matches and I leave it in 

    1. Do I move on at this point or do I test for Variolinum now? (2nd on the
    list) 
    Or do I just wait until next time to ask the body about Variolinum? 

    2  When do I move on to the next dropping point? The moment the body
    indicates that any remedy is a yes? 
   
    When the Pituitary doesn't drop anymore in the next session, when would I
    ever ask the body about Varicellen and Airborne Toxins which are number 3
    and 4 on the list? The Pituitary might never drop again.... But these
    Remedies can show up on another Meridians/Points if needed... so no
    worries?

    3 I understand that it is best to use less remedies that solve multiple
    issues, rather than too many nosodes which results in too much information
    and diminished energy for a particular focus and effectiveness....

    Is there an ideal range to try to stay within, regarding the number of
    Nosodes used? For example 2-5  3-7....
    And what about the number of Supports, Compositae or Hommachords?

    4 Also, thanks so much for sharing your observations about my thinking
    approach, you are correct. 
    I do also witness myself at times thinking in an opposite approach than
    Biontology.  Not because I want to, but only as a conditioned habit of
    thinking based upon my upbringing of turning to symptoms or suspected
    substances. I definitely see and agree that this symptomatic approach is
    ultimately ineffective.  Thanks for your continued support in bringing my
    awareness back to a different way of thinking.

    I think I unconsciously turn to the old way of thinking if I get confused
    or overwhelmed with all of the unknowns in my new learnings.  Sometimes
    asking questions and receiving your guidance helps me allow the old ways to
    fall away.  

    Thanks so much for your time....Jewell

    Jewell:

    1. When something matches, this means that the point is corrected. This was
    the goal (to balance the Pituitary). So why test for something else there?

    2. You don't need to look for something that is not disturbing, and the
    disturbance is shown by drops...
    So you stop measuring when you have found the Remedy that balances the
    drops.... in this case Poliomyelitis. When the Pituitary is not dropping
    anymore in other sessions, there is no other Remedy needed. 

    The primary focus has to be on balancing the whole Energetic System and not
    on the Remedies, they are just aids to get there. If, for example, you
    never measure Mercury on any meridian, even if someone has had Amalgams,
    you don't need to use it. What isn't measured doesn't cause the Functional
    Disturbance that needs to be addressed.

    3. Yes, less is more. But it takes Nosodes to get to the Cause.... so you
    need to use them along with the proper Support.
    The rule of thumb is 8 Nosodes and 8 Support Remedies, but of course this
    can vary a little bit. You'll also have to take into account the condition
    of your Client..

    4. It is not so strange to initially think in this way. There are many
    other modalities using instruments to test in the way you suggested (e.g. "
    tomatoes = bad, spinach = good"). It is just not the way Biontology is
    designed, we go a big step beyond that and make the body stronger to be
    able to deal better with whatever we come into contact with... The first
    approach makes the world smaller, the latter one bigger... 

    And yes a new way of operating, which is the challenge in Biontology, does
    acquire some Detoxification ;-).
    Going into the comfort zone is always tempting... but ultimately it is
    liberating to approach life in a completely different way once and awhile..

    Perfect.  What you have described in your response is what I initially
    understood in the training, yet somehow I began to question my
    understanding.  Since this measuring and testing for remedies is so
    foundational.....I wanted to be clear on this as I proceed.  This clears up
    some fuzzy areas for me.  Phew!

    And, I'm happy that Biontology goes "beyond"......and I can be part of
    making the world bigger instead of smaller for myself and others.  I don't
    want to run from allergens, toxins, and microbes.....I want them to be of
    no consequence to me : )   Yet, it's sometimes scary to see the world
    becoming more polluted it seems, not less....at least so far........

    Thanks!!!! .....Jewell

October 2015 - Why Protocol is Important!

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
October 2015 edited October 2015 in Q&A Flag
Question
My husband received several Biontology sessions from another practitioner, who
presented himself to be a Biontologist, which he is not. My husband now wonders
if he needs more sessions. The following happened to him:

In his fifth appointment he received a treatment with Biliary Cirrhosis,
Aluminum, Plumbum, Cuprum and Mercury. After this his gums became extremely
swollen and painful on both sides. The first week eating and swallowing was
very painful. The following treatment he received the same remedies. The pain
subsided, but the swelling continued for 5 weeks. When the swelling finally
subsided, he got shingles, which was very painful. He then was treated with the
shingles remedy, but it became even worse. Only when he visited a homeopathic
doctor and was given Nux Vomica and Belladonna the shingles symptoms subsided.
However, he doesn’t believe he got rid of it completely and feels it went
inside again, because he has been very tired and lacks a lot of energy he
normally has. Do you believe he needs more Biontology sessions? And what focus
should they have?

Answer
This story illustrates everything that I have been warning about. And it also
shows how this probably happens many times more than I get to hear about,
because clients usually don’t realize they have been maltreated.

First of, finding more than one or two Heavy Metals during one session has
hardly ever happened to me, and more than three never. So this means that
something went wrong in the assessment phase, and most likely there are
hang-ups on Heavy Metals caused by emphasis on this topic on the Internet and
in the alternative health world. But Biontology is not based on ideas, and you
need to measure objectively. This was not an objective, proper measurement, and
the first mistake was to use so many Heavy Metals at once… I never thought it
was necessary to mention this specifically, as this would never be an issue
when measurement is done right and the protocol is followed.

The second, and even bigger mistake is then to repeat the first mistake by
giving the exact same treatment after a week, even though the client suffered
severe negative reactions, there was no improvement, and obviously the remedies
did not correct the drops. It is impossible that the same incorrect measurement
was found again without projection. When remedies work, this means that the
next treatment there is an improvement of the meridian they were matched on. If
these remedies really would have corrected the Nervous System and/or Pancreas/
Spleen meridians (assuming that they were dropping based on the remedy
selection...), then they should not have been necessary a next time…
You always need to look back at your treatment, what points were dropping, what
remedies were used, how the treatment affected the client, and how it changed
the measurements the next time. And then you need to adapt the treatment
accordingly, especially when you clearly did something wrong, which was shown
by the condition of the client. But to repeat the same, obviously damaging,
treatment shows that there was no reflection and that nothing was learned.

The third, and even bigger mistake was that this client has arthritis (we
learned about this through further enquiry), which means that there must be a
Kidney problem, and nothing was done with this knowledge. Apart from the
measurements this should have been a second warning sign to be very, very
careful with initiating detoxification. Arthritis simply means that the Kidneys
are not OK at all. So even if one fails to measure a Kidney problem, the
symptoms always give a second safety net in assessing whether it is OK to treat
with Toxins or Heavy Metals. All of this information is available and has been
repeated several times on the forum…

The fourth, and in my opinion the biggest mistake is to not recognize ones own
weaknesses and to not seek advise on the forum or in the Q&As when a client is
suffering.
Professionalism is not shown by how many treatments you have done or by how
many successes you have had, but by how you deal with your failures. The lack
of interest in finding out what went wrong when people responded negatively to
the given therapy, and in finding out how you maybe could have solved these
problems, that is what amazes me. Why would you not be interested in these
answers if you truly are invested in helping people?

The only way we sometimes find out that these things happen in the field is
because some clients contact us with bad experiences and give us feedback, or
desperately ask for help (usually they want to remain anonymous and don't want
us to contact their therapist, which makes it all the more difficult to change
things). Only very few therapists have contacted me directly, and when they did
this was usually after they have put their clients through far too much
already. This obviously is only the tip of the iceberg, as most clients will
not realize that their therapist did something wrong and their reaction to the
therapy is not normal.

What I would like all of you to take from this is that without exception the
damage was a matter of unrecognised or ignored Kidney weakness and the use of
Heavy Metals or Liver nosodes when the body was not ready. Something I have
been warning about for some years now. Maybe my warnings have been too abstract
and needed a real life example like this to illustrate what can actually
happen, and that it is not normal for clients to have these kind of responses. 
I do not judge you if you make a mistake, but please search for a solution and
don't blame the client... You can always come to me when something like this
occurs. What I do find troubling is that hardly anyone comes to us for advice
in these cases. We are all trying to help and it is sad if people suffer
unnecessarily from something that should actually be able to help them!

As for the original question of this client, which was if he needed more
Biontology sessions. He does, but with a completely different focus. When a
person gets shingles during the course of Biontology sessions, there has been
an overdosing of some sort, which has put the body under a tremendous amount of
stress. Immediate attention needs to be paid to the Kidneys and Adrenal glands
along with treatment with Variolinum especially and possibly Varicellen. Apart
from this, he needs to rest and drink a lot of water.

    By exchanging emails with both therapist and client we have learned several
    things that I do find important to share so all can learn.

    I know that the first question that many of you will likely ask is: "who is
    this practitioner?", but this is totally irrelevant and not what it is all
    about. We have received too many similar stories and I am often puzzled as
    to what to do about this phenomenon, since so much sensitivity is involved
    when responsibility is pointed out. Also, hardly any of the clients seeking
    help want us to contact their practitioner. They just seek help...
    And was helping people not THE motivation to get into this field?

    The biggest problem identified over these past few years is that for too
    long now there has been a culture of suspicion and fear that inhibits
    honesty and openness. How can we learn and make progress when mistakes
    cannot be openly admitted in a safe environment...? It seems a big issue
    that people feel exposed when a mistake is pointed out (some practitioners
    even feel the forum is not safe..), but there is no other way. These things
    HAVE to come to light, or else clients will continue to be damaged, and own
    responsibility of practitioners denied. When this happens all
    self-correction stops, and how then are we any better than the medical
    system that many of you so much abhor...?

    There is no way I can convince you that it is safe to contact us if you are
    convinced otherwise, I can only say that I deeply respect practitioners who
    have been (and still are) open about their own personal struggles with
    Biontology. By sharing, they allow everyone to learn along with them. And
    also, I am extremely grateful to the practitioner who sent us the above
    question without fear of conflict with the practitioner who did the
    treatment. THIS is how we all learn. We don't want Biontology to become the
    new "medical system", a copy of the current one, where often all is about
    ego, success and money, and failures are swept under the rug because of
    fear of one's own position.

    In the next comment I will sum things up that where done wrong and why this
    is so problematic. It will take a little time because information is spread
    over many emails and hand and foot charts.

    The reminder that we are not being judged is very helpful, because it is
    very hard to show failures to everybody. We need to keep in mind that when
    posting questions, you help others who maybe do not dare to ask. 
   
    We have to remind ourself that we are in an everlasting school. In school
    it is natural to get negative feedback together with positive feedback. And
    maybe dare to have a two way communication, because the only one seeing it
    with their own eyes is us. 
   
    What makes it difficult and frightening for me is that I have so much
    respect for what you recommend and for your knowledge. It is so easy to
    misinterpret each other and not fully understand one another. So many times
    I feel like I am asking too much or that I am a pain in the ... But only
    then I truly understand and get all the information needed. Thank you so
    much for your help.

    Johan and Karolina.  I just finished your training in September 2015 and
    have read through the manual and have treated myself twice.  I am honestly
    afraid to practice on other people because I feel there are many potential
    mistakes I don't know about or how to avoid yet.  For example doing two
    heavy metals in one treatment or clearing multiple vaccinations in one
    treatment. 

    Questions 
    1. I understand that the Kidneys must be cleared first in order to handle
    the detox of a heavy metal. As a beginner, there is the potential of my
    readings on the kidneys being incorrect so how do I protect against this? 
    Perhaps don't clear any heavy metals until I am certain I know my
    readings. 

    2. When it comes to treating the hormones, is it ok to clear multiple
    vaccinations at once (Polio, tettinus, pertussis, veriolinum, varicellen)
    when the kidneys are also balanced in the same session?  Or should we first
    make sure the kidnesy are balanced at the start of the session before
    clearing all of these vaccines and/or only do one vaccine clearing at a
    time?

    3. In terms of me learning all the pitfalls to avoid mistakes and hurting
    clients, Should I wait to practice on other people until I have read
    through every word of the forum?  Or until I complete the 2nd phase of
    basic 1?

    Many thanks!!!

    Thank you Karolina and Johan for this important discussion, and also to the
    practitioner who asked the question.  

    Magdalena, I felt exactly as you did when I first began practicing a year
    ago. Reading the Forum has been so helpful for me during this first year.
     I have referred back to Johan's post "Treating the Terrain" many times.  
   
    Using the search feature to search by topics and printing out especially
    relevant posts has also been very helpful for me.  I think I have read most
    everything at least once :-)  Please ask all your questions.  This helps us
    all.

    I agree that it's very important to put ego aside. There is so much to
    learn and all feedback is so helpful.  I always hope this is the case for
    everyone, but have sometimes experienced this is not so.
    I feel that we all need to hold each other accountable in this way. Our
    clients deserve this respect.

    Liselotte:
    Very well put Liselotte. You don't have to be afraid that you are a "pain
    in the.." -your words- to us or anybody else on this forum, because this is
    what the forum is all about. It is a learning platform, and learning is
    only possible by exposing weaknesses and questions, so input and help can
    be offered.

    Your contribution to this group-learning experience is amazing and I am
    pretty sure many students and practitioners are very grateful for your
    input. I am actually in awe of your persistence and dedication to "getting
    it", and have a deep respect for this. If Johan and I come with an answer
    that you don't understand it does not serve anyone if you ignore this. The
    only way to learn is to observe what you are doing, look at the effects,
    ask where you don't understand, read the answers on the forum, ask again if
    you don't understand, try to implement what you think you understood now,
    ask if there are still questions left, etc. etc. Learning is quite a
    work-out, but pretty enjoyable when you are not overly attached to getting
    everything right, right away.

    Also, don't forget that WE are in a learning process too. Johan and I are
    constantly confronted with the fact that our explanations may not be
    complete, are hard to understand or are easily misinterpreted. Our learning
    process is to find better ways to transfer Johan's insights in a
    comprehensive but easy to digest method. I think we have made a lot of
    improvement over the years, as you will find if you compare earlier posts
    with the more recent ones. But still... the learning continues.

    Everyone of you who invests in learning on this forum or in certification,
    does not only invest in themselves, but also in the maturity of the field
    of Biontology as a whole. I can only be grateful for this, no matter how
    much work is involved for me. I can also see how much work YOU and other
    active posters put in. As you said it is not a one sided experience.

    Magdalena:
    This is always an issue, we have to warn about the possible pitfalls, but
    at the same time it may scare new students to the point that they don't
    dare to practice anymore. And everyone has to start somewhere! The real
    learning starts in practice. Waiting is really not a good idea. Just like
    learning how to drive a car, you need to continue to apply the practical
    part right away, because the memory of how to measure is not completely
    ingrained in your system yet. The feeling of how it is done is still very
    fragile and easy to forget.

    My suggestion is to select your guinea pigs well. If you start practicing
    your measurement and treatment with relatively healthy people and follow
    all the steps of the protocol, there is hardly any risk. But even if you do
    everything wrong with them, they may only have an unnecessary bad week
    (often mystified by practitioners as "detox", but in fact "toxification"),
    but otherwise nothing bad will happen and they will even experience some
    improvement in their sense of wellbeing over several treatments.

    Children are usually very resilient too and a very safe group to treat.
    Treating them will also increase your trust in the power of the Chiren,
    because they respond so easily and even when you have very little insight
    in what you are actually doing... a really grateful group. Measurement on
    children however can be a hassle... so they are good for confidence in the
    therapy, but not so good for measurement practice ;-)

    There is a small group of people that you may want to avoid when you are
    not confident in your measurement and understanding of the therapy yet.
    Those are people with known Kidney problems or arthritis/joint pain (this
    too shows that there must be a Kidney issue). Also I would advise you to
    not yet treat people with serious Liver conditions or very weak and/or very
    old people as guinea pigs.

    There is another good reason for not starting your practice with very old
    and sick people, and that is that they often have a very bad circulation,
    and dry and/or thin skin. This creates a measurement problem in itself and
    will not at all help with your confidence.

    So starting with your relatively healthy friends and family is safe. Don't
    worry too much, and even if something does not go as planned, you can go to
    the forum and ask what may have gone wrong and what you can do to correct
    it. 

    Your specific questions will be answered by Johan later.

    To Everyone:
    The reason that we have to continue to emphasise dangers, even though we
    already pointed them out in the manual/protocols and many times on the
    forum too, is that we are still confronted with practitioners who don't
    take them very seriously. We can only guess as to why this is, but
    currently I have come to believe that this is, because if someone can get
    away with treating 95% of the clients the wrong way (not according to
    protocol), when 5% of the clients get into trouble, this is not recognised
    as a treatment mistake . But it really is. No one has to become worse from
    Biontology. If some of your clients do, there is something to learn from
    this. And immediate recommendations need to be requested. 

    There is a group of people with whom you definitely should not make the
    mistake of not honouring the body's natural sequence of treatment. And the
    amazing thing that happens when things do go wrong because of not adhering
    to protocol, not only does it cause physical harm to the client, but often
    the client gets the blame too. Why? Because 95% of the time it went fine,
    so it must be the client! This is obviously the wrong thinking. 

    The real situation is that in spite of, and not thanks to the way that
    these "95%" clients were treated their bodies overcame the stress of too
    early release of toxins/metals. But you can imagine that there is a a group
    of people who is not that resilient. 95% may "only" suffer "severe detox"
    (again, this is a misleading term for over treatment), but the other 5% are
    those people who may suffer serious consequences from the exact same
    treatment.

    Also, "getting away with" wrong treatment still leads to suboptimal
    results, but this is unfortunately also not recognized usually by
    practitioners who got stuck in their ways. If one has never tried to use
    the Chiren the correct way, one never sees the difference and the real
    potential of the therapy. But because the Chiren is such a powerful
    instrument and people are "healed" of serious diseases in for example 50
    (!) weekly treatments anyway, long time practitioners think they are
    proficient. But what if this could also be done in 10 or even 8 treatments?
    That is what makes the difference.

    Johan recently treated a woman who has visited several different therapists
    in the US over several years, all of them claim to be very successful, but
    she had little or no result. Within 5 treatments from Johan almost all of
    her symptoms were gone... You may think: "well that is Johan, he is
    brilliant". Yes he is, but his system is available to any of you... it is
    the Biontology protocol! 

    From what I have seen, the treatments that this lady needed were actually
    pretty STANDARD treatments according to protocol. Nothing special, just
    common patterns as we often encounter them. In fact NO other remedy was
    used than what you can find in the measurement protocol in your manual, and
    the order of treatment of the treatment protocol was maintained throughout
    all 5 sessions. 

    I have seen this several times now. So I will continue to emphasise: there
    is a definite advantage in following the protocol and learning as much from
    Johan as you can... But I guess all of you who are actively involved on
    this forum and partake in the Q&As, already know this. Most likely the eyes
    and ears who need to read or hear this are not interested. 

    Just know that we have gold in our hands with Johan's method of treatment.
    Let's benefit from all he knows as long as he is still sharing.

    Answers to Magdalena's Questions
    1. In the beginning the trust in your measurements needs to grow. This
    trust in yourself can only be obtained by practising on other people. It is
    very difficult to be objective about yourself and that is why you need to
    practice on other people. Just follow the protocol and if you want to be
    sure you can always put in 2 Kidney support remedies in when treating (I
    recommend Populus and Solidago). Do not treat with any Heavy Metal for at
    leas the first 5 sessions.

    2. Regarding balancing the Hormonal System: 
    The first session you should always treat with Poliomyelitis and
    Anti-tetanus (because I always find these necessary through measurement
    apart from the times there are endorphins), but other vaccinations/
    childhood diseases may or may not be needed. You can add other remedies IF
    you measure them. 
    Very often the Poliomyelitis for example needs to be cleared first before
    the body can expel the rest. Apart from Pertussis, Variolinum and
    Varicellen. It is uncommon for other vaccination/childhood diseases to show
    up. 
    So in the first session, you treat the needed vaccinations and then, if
    necessary, clear the Kidneys. Kidney support is always a good idea.

    3. It is undesirable to wait with treating other people until the Basic 2
    or until you have read the forum completely
    The Basic 2 is only useful if you have had experience in measuring an
    treating and then ask all the questions in the Basic 2. You must have
    confidence in yourself. Follow the protocol, if you are afraid, add the
    kidney remedies.
    I also suggest that you do only take on "light" cases in the beginning. If
    anybody has Kidney problems or signs of arthritis or rheumatism, then do
    not start with them until you have more experience. Try to find people with
    allergies, migraines, neck/shoulder, stomach issues, (mild) fatigue... or
    something like that. Those are easy and safe cases.

    I am so grateful for this topic. It has helped put so many things into
    perspective for me. Thank you so much!

    When I first began Biontology treatment, I always felt quite good
    immediately following the session, but then in the days following had
    extreme detox symptoms. My practitioner seemed unconcerned when I reported
    this, and I assumed this was normal and to be expected. At one time, during
    a walk, I experienced severe pain in the area of the left kidney,
    accompanied by nausea. I felt quite concerned, but my practitioner again
    suggested it probably was a pulled muscle.

    I did experience a lot of symptom relief, but at the expense of quite a lot
    of suffering, and no lasting results were achieved. When I became a
    practitioner and began treating myself, I was distressed to see what poor
    condition my health was in. And even more distressed when I later saw my
    previous treatment records, seeing that the Liver and other yin organs were
    treated in the first sessions, with little or no support ever for the
    kidneys. There had been no following of protocol. I feel grateful that I
    didn't become seriously ill, but I could have.

    These treatments were given before the Remedy Book and Chiren Manual were
    published, and my hope is that these situations are no longer happening. I
    know that my practitioner had nothing but the best intent and truly
    believed that extreme detox was a normal part of treatment.

    In treating myself, I have finally also learned that this is not the case.
    I appreciate so much the example given of Johan's successful treating of a
    client based on basic protocol alone. I also made many mistakes while
    treating myself and others, but gratefully am learning a better way. There
    is such a beautiful foundation in understanding and following the protocol.
    And what I am learning is that "less" is often "more" in terms of treatment
    effectiveness, particularly with seriously ill clients.

    Support of the Kidneys can't be stressed enough. I have experienced this in
    my own treatment and the treatment of others. I feel sorry about mistakes
    in judgement I've made during my own early sessions.but I am learning, as
    we all are. I share this experience only in the hopes that it may help
    someone else

    I would like to address Karolina's statement: "The biggest problem
    identified over these past few years is that for too long now there has
    been a culture of suspicion and fear that inhibits honesty and openness.
    How can we learn and make progress when mistakes cannot be openly admitted
    in a safe environment...?"

    There is a strange negativity that pervades our community. When a group is
    'separated' from the main community it becomes a danger to the
    psychological health of the community when it contracts to being
    confidential, secretive and separate. There should be an 'outing' of this
    kind of behavior and activity. It's one thing to talk privately, it's a
    totally different thing to have a group that basically separates itself
    from the larger community. This becomes a 'faction' and is very unhealthy,
    insecure and promotes division. 

    I am one of the products of this 'secret' organisation - and have been
    labeled a spy and lord knows what else. Ego is at it's base. Karolina is
    polite in her attempts to explain this problem. I, on the other hand have a
    vested interest in honesty and integrity in my learning environment.
    Karolina has been trying to deal with this for some time but it takes the
    courage and insight of the individual to speak out and expose this kind of
    paranoiac behavior and to stop supporting it. 

    What students are interested in is to learn how to best be a Biontologist.
    BUT to compromise one's integrity for the goal of learning the 'secrets' of
    Biontology is a serious emotional and psychological endeavor. I urge
    everyone to look deep inside and find your inner truth about this so we can
    move on and match the integrity of the Chiren and Biontology.

    To address the points that Satya has brought up:  
    I too have been in a quandary about over-treatment, 'healing crisis'
    (Johan's disliked phrase) and how to evaluate progress.  

    When I started treating myself, for I had no Biontologist locally, so I had
    to treat myseIf.  I experienced many post-treatment discomfort, from
    intense jaw pain, severely weakened arms - I could not pick up my left arm
    first and then the next treatment, my right arm.  I also began treating my
    wife, who has a more complicated health history of cysts, tumors and
    cancer.  She also experienced intense discomfort after the treatments.
    This, I was able to understand and control more easily since it was not
    myself.  Of course, I knew in three days things would improve and they did
    - for the better, much better.  

    So my understanding of the post Chiren treatments were that it was not
    detrimental to feel bad for the two or three days after treatment.  What I
    would like to understand more clearly is the post treatment reaction to the
    Chiren.  Resent posts by Johan have cleared up much since he clearly
    affirms that these types of reactions are not desirable.  I am
    understanding, but not totally, that using 8 nosodes is not always
    necessary, this depends on the presenting health of the patient and/or the
    results of previous treatments.  

    Beside the need to follow protocol, there is a need for an expanded
    understanding of how to avoid intense 'healing crisis' and promote smoother
    recovery.  I know that many of us struggle with this, therefore I think it
    beneficial to further discuss this topic.

    As promised I will give a list of the biggest mistakes that were made.
    There were measurement mistakes also, but that is normal when you just
    start treating, and pointing these all out is of no use. 
    So the following mistakes have nothing to do with measurement skills, and
    could have been easily prevented just by studying and using the protocols.

    * Scars, and especially a major surgical scar were not treated 

    * Poliomyelitis was never used, even though the Pituitary was dropping the
    first measurement, and also no other remedies were used that possibly could
    have corrected this point

    * The first two treatments there were no footplates used

    * After the hand treatment no re-measurement was done according to the
    client. However, the student denies this. So we can leave this in the
    middle... but it is important to always remeasure, as this is the only way
    to know what your choice of remedies has done, or hasn't done. 

    * Symptoms did not really improve beyond some mood changes, and still the
    conclusion was drawn that there was a lot of improvement based on the
    measurements, which showed a progress that can only be explained by
    projection or wishful thinking. You need to look at the symptoms, as well
    as the measurements when evaluating progress. 

    * In the session (the fifth) that led to all problems, according to the
    measurement, ALL points on the Gallbladder meridians were dropping, but
    nothing else. IF the measurement was correct, this means severe Gallbladder
    issues and thus stress and suppression. It is impossible that one organ
    system is so severely affected and no other organ system shows problems.
    This, and the fact that the Gallbladder is a Yang organ, that first needs
    to be ready before starting with metals and/or Liver, 

    * In the same session, there was no organ system that warranted the use of
    Heavy Metal remedies. Biliary Cirrhosis corrected the Gallbladder, and
    since no other points dropped, only Gallbladder, and additional Kidney
    support would be indicated. It is beyond understanding where the idea came
    from that 4 Heavy Metals would be beneficial... Even if there were drops on
    Nervous System or Pancreas/Spleen that reacted to a Heavy Metal remedy
    (there were no drops),  it would still have been better to wait because the
    Gallbladder (a Yang organ) was so severely imbalanced (all points
    dropping).

    * The following session it became clear that a persisting negative response
    was the result of the treatment approach. And still the exact same
    treatment was repeated... 

    * The bad results were projected, and blamed on the emotional condition of
    the client, instead of identified for what they were caused by. All
    information that we have points to wrong treatment. This wrong conclusion
    led to not taking responsibility by giving supportive additional Kidney
    treatments (when something like this happens to me I offer these corrective
    treatments for free, since I was responsible). 

    * Instead of giving supportive treatments the client was left without
    treatment for 3 weeks with continued suffering of symptoms that were not
    there before the sessions. So all that happened was still responsibility of
    the practitioner. Then, after the third week, the client got shingles,
    which was a progression from the former reactions. Shingles only occurs in
    a severely stressed and exhausted body. But the response of the
    practitioner was "he was not my client the moment he got shingles",
    again... wrong conclusion. Even if the reaction was not immediate, it was a
    direct result of wrong treatment.

    * When he finally gave "supportive treatment", this was done without
    measuring, and without remedies.

    So you can all see, many things went wrong in this case, but it is not that
    difficult to avoid these same mistakes.

    Stephano:
    It is normal to have some healing-responses the 1st to 3rd day following a
    treatment, but these should not be severe. Normal reactions after treatment
    are:

    1. Feeling tired
    2. Experiencing a slight headache => should be easily resolved by drinking
    more water

    Whenever the symptoms are more severe, then you have to look back at your
    treatment. 
    Your own experiences after self-treatment and treating your wife initially,
    may have been caused by not identifying Kidney drops when in fact they were
    there. 

    Feet are usually a bit moist, which causes the sounds to be higher when
    measuring. This high sound is not relevant, but is sometimes mistaken by
    beginners as "not-a-drop". Especially when you don't hold the points long
    enough. This is one thing I also noticed in the above case. There were
    hardly any points indicated as drops on the feet! So you can imagine how
    Kidney drops can be easily overlooked by students, who are still practicing
    their measurement skills.

    Personally I had hardly any measurement training at all, and it took some
    time before my measurements became reliable. But if you are patient, take
    the time to retest points, wiggle a little bit around to identify the exact
    position etc. measuring can be learned even without a lot of guidance. But
    it does take patience, and also testing your own measurement competence. 

    If you present yourself immediately as a proficient therapist, then of
    course you never give yourself that time, because you create expectations
    that you then feel pressured to fulfil. It is much better to start with
    friends and just measure. Measure, measure, measure.... don't focus on the
    treatment the first couple of times, but take your time to get a good
    feeling of where the points are, how much pressure you need etc. And you
    can easily test yourself: 

    Measurement Self-Test:
    1. Measure all points of a person
    2. Make a note of all points dropping
    3. Think about whether these points make sense according to the symptoms 
    4. Put the notes away, and drink a cup of tea with your test-person and
    forget about your measurements
    5. Measure the same person again, while making notes of the drops
    6. Compare the dropping points => they should be the same!

    Of course there can also be "consistent measurement mistakes", caused by
    doing the exact same thing and thus having the same outcome. This will be
    less common, but can happen. If this is the case, then the only way to find
    out that your measurement is incorrect is by observing that your
    measurements do not confirm the symptoms a client has. 

    Measurement does have a learning curve, and needs much attention. I know it
    is tempting to immediately focus on the treatment, but measurement is the
    basic skill that you really need to master to have the best results. And
    trust me... NOBODY gets it completely right, right away.

    Of course, you are not a beginner anymore, so I wonder whether you still
    experience the same level of "healing crisis" in your clients. I would
    think that the reactions are much milder now?

    I would like to put it out there that I would LOVE to be contacted if there
    is any doubt about any of my treatments with patients. I would never think
    of "blaming" or being angry with the patient. People's lives are in our
    hands and learning from our mistakes is critical.

    Thanks for sharing these thoughts and experiences. I feel the heavy
    responsibility of Chiren treatment as a somewhat beginner practitioner--I
    think I will always feel I am learning. It is so necessary to respect the
    complexity of individuals and to take the time to thoroughly consider their
    health profiles. Biontology is not an easy or formulaic practice, although
    the protocol is clearly outlined in our manuals and discussed here.
    Perhaps, we all feel the pressure of time when we treat others and need to
    really focus on the moment at hand. Even while treating myself I am
    wondering how many treatments I can fit into my busy schedule. Patience,
    concentration, empathy, humility, and perseverance are very difficult to
    cultivate in modern times and so very necessary to the practice of
    Biontology.

Early Puberty

Terry Werner
June 2015 edited June 2015 in Case Discussion Flag
New client:
16 months old girl. Have not seen her yet.

History:
Normal vaginal birth
Family eats better than the average American diet
I have not checked on their water source yet, but I suspect that they filter
their water and buy bottled water

Symptoms:
Signs of puberty

Medical interventions:
No vaccines

Since the child is only 16 month, it is going to be to measure her for I assume
she will not sit long.  

Question
Do you have any suggestions on what to try or any thoughts at all on what could
cause this?

    Maybe she can email you symptoms / concerns?
    To observe and measure is what you can do, sounds like a fun and
    challenging case, a 16 month old! 
    Maybe the mother can have her on her lap and distract her somewhat.
    Maybe she can drink or eat or have some kind of other focus with her mama.
    When she starts pulling her hands away try to switch to the feet for as
    much info as you can get and back to hands for as long as possible or
    needed..
    Good luck and looking forward to an update ;)

    Given the limited time I will get to measure and try remedies with the
    child, do you have any suggestions on what to look at first?  I was
    wondering if I should try hormone balancing remedies like hormeel or should
    I look for a toxin.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    June 2015 edited June 2015 Flag
    Clearly the Hormone System should have the major focus. 

    Pituitary may be involved for any symptom of premature of puberty as it
    regulates sex hormone production.
    Adrenals may also be involved if it is premature hair growth that is the
    symptom, as they create androgens. 
    But you should balance the complete Hormone System anyway.

    When balancing points, you really need to look for nosodes. 
    Hormeel is a support remedy that may be used after you have balanced all
    the Hormone System points with nosodes. The only supports that are used in
    the phase of balancing points on the Hormone System are the high potency
    remedies Selenium and/or Berberis for the Adrenal glands.

    An update - I saw the child for my first time and she was surprisingly
    willing to let me read her.  I found Platinum on her Hormone System so
    hopefully that will take care of her, but, of course, she is coming back
    later.
  •

    Thank you for keeping us updated on this case.

    Did you measure anything else on this girl?
    What other remedies did you treat with?
    Did you try to measure with different nosodes first?
    Did you find out what the source of exposure was? 

    (It is quite unusual to find that Platinum is the only remedy that clears
    drops on the Hormone System in the first session. It may be found on Pineal
    or Pituitary sometimes, but in the first session the usual vaccinations are
    most likely what corrects the drops... things like Platinum may show up
    another session if they form an underlying problem)

    There is a reason for asking these questions, because Heavy Metals should
    not be treated in a first session.
    Measuring Heavy Metals on the Hormone System (if nothing else matches,
    which is rare) does pose a problem, since the Hormone System always comes
    first in treatment, and on the other hand treating with Heavy Metals causes
    a big burden on the elimination system.

    Did you at least take care to check the Kidneys very carefully?
    Were there no drops on the Kidneys?

    If you did find drops on the Kidneys initially, then you should definitely
    not have treated with Platinum, even if you also used a remedy that
    corrected the Kidney drops. The Kidneys (and preferably all other Yang
    organs) should be ready to eliminate before you start using remedies of
    Heavy Metals. Using them earlier on, at best will have limited effect
    (because it cannot be properly excreted and the body doesn't bother
    detoxifying) and at worst does a lot of damage (because the body does
    initiate the release of Heavy Metals in the blood stream, but cannot
    excrete them).

    Depending on how toxic the child is and how degenerated the organs are, it
    may be a big burden to treat with Heavy Metals so early on and you really
    would want to avoid this...
    There is a serious warning about this in the manual for a good reason. Even
    though mostly you will get away with treating with Heavy Metals at the
    wrong time, it will not increase effectiveness of treatment and will be
    dangerous for your client.
    So even if results are fine (and with children without serious Kidney
    problems they usually will), this does not negate the risk that has been
    taken and there is no advantage to taking this risk.

    I hope you understand my response, and don't feel discouraged to continue
    and give us information and follow up on this case. I consider client
    safety very important, and have been confronted with cases gone wrong...

    Thank you again, for giving me the opportunity to explain a very important
    aspect of the protocol. I think more people have struggled with finding
    Heavy Metals (or Liver nosodes) on the Hormone System while the Kidneys and
    Yang organs are not ready.. and the Protocol does not explain what to do in
    this case. So the answer to that question is: don't treat with the Heavy
    Metal (or Liver nosode), try to find anything else that corrects the
    Hormone System, and correct the Kidneys and Yang organs first before you
    use the Heavy Metal remedies (or Liver Nosodes) in another session.
  •

    You are very right!  I knew that heavy metals were not the first to
    choose.  I did make sure the kidneys were clean, though.  When I started
    treating her since I knew this child was unvaccinated, I was thinking that
    toxins would be the most likely culprit, and then platinum resonated so I
    used it.  I always wait with heavy metals and the liver nosodes until the
    kidneys and intestines are clear because I remember learning about that
    before.  I think I just jumped the gun. Thank you for your clear
    explanation of why it is important to wait.

    The mother was only so interested in biontology so I am hoping she will
    come back for her next session.

Breast Cancer

AlexandraAlexandra
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
I have a question about breast cancer (left breast). The patient is 45 years
old, married, she has two children. She refuses medical treatment completely,
which makes me a little nervous. The only wants Biophoton-Therapy (and I put
her on a special diet)

Does anyone have experience with breast cancer patients who want to be treated
ONLY with biophotons?

She feels physically well, she has no complaints. She suffered from depression
twice in her lifetime (stress), the last was 5 years ago. She says that she is
mentally well. We still make a lot of talk therapy.

Her docotor has prescribed her thyroid hormones for 10 years. Which I think was
not necessary at all. She stopped taking them 5 years ago. I treated her with
Thyroidea, which helped.

I have now been treating her for eight times. (She wants 10 treatments, which
she has said from the beginning on)

My questions:

To fix the drops I need but most of the treatments:
2-3 x Standard Program > 12
1 x Footplate standard > 12 (not always)
1 x Foot Plate (Dyslexia)
1 x Short (Busch / Bach Flowers)

Question 1: Is this too much?

It is striking that I measure every time drops on the Small and Large
Intestine, many points, Anus every time
Tuberculinum and Toxoplasmosis I had treated about 5 x

On the Anus Point is Carc. Coli very effective.

When I trated her with Campylobacter Pylori, all points on the Small Intestines
and Colon were ok.

I measured several times Diverticulose and Glyoxal on Colon.

On the Gallbladder several times Cholecystitis

On the Gallbladder Salmonella

Question 2: Is it possible that her weakness in the Small Intestines and Colon
have anything to do with breast cancer? I rather suspected the Pituitary. But
after a couple of treatments the Hormone System is usually ok.

Question 3) I have treated her each time with Carcinoma Mammae / Mastopathia
and Mamma Cystica – whitout measuring. Does that make sense?

Question 4) Johan has said that cancer patients almost always have a Spin
Inversion. Have I understood that right? Or only if they are have conventional
medicine treatment , chemo?
I treat Spin Inversion every time (with blood) Can I use the same drop of blood
for ten treatments? Make long distance treatments against Spin Inversion with
blood sense?

    I am always very glad if they only want biophotons!

    Question 1:

    Every session you need to do:
    One standard treatment >12
    One dyslexia treatment
    No more!

    Breast cancer is caused by:
    a) Thyroid (in case it is a fibroid) or
    b) Circulation (if it is or was a cyst) - then you have to look at
    Adrenals, Gallbladder and Heart

    Have you treated for Whiplash? This often causes Thyroid problems and thus
    fibroids.

    Question 2: 

    Does she have constipation? I have never seen this relationship. But
    Gallbladder issues could cause cramping of the milk or lymphatic glands in
    the breast and thus cause a cyst. But then you have to look for Gallbladder
    problems and what they are caused by. Appendictis and/or Tonsillitis cause
    digestive problems and can cause many points to drop.

    Question 3: 

    Symptomatically it makes sense but in this way you will not get any tumor
    away. Did you test if the person actually has cancer? Many medical
    diagnoses are misdiagnoses.

    Question 4: 
   
    I have said that Leukemia is often caused by Spin Inversion. All other
    cancer patients might have Spin Inversion, but I do not see it often.
    90% of all cancers are occurring after a period of heavy stress. Heavy
    stress means exhausted Adrenal glands.
    If people are chronically tired, they are more vulnerable to Spin
    Inversion. 

    You should use a fresh drop of blood every time. I already covered that in
    an earlier post.

    Female 40+ years old. Discovered stage 2 breast cancer 2 weeks ago.
    Mastectomy a week ago and coming for biophoton therapy this Friday. Decided
    not to have radiation or chemotherapy but on Chinese herbs.She has been on
    thyroid hormone for many years. Not sure how long. Can I use scar/ whiplash
    at this stage and what should I look out for? Thanks and look forward to

    Hi Jennifer

    The women I treat for breast cancer has also been on Thyroid hormone for
    about ten years. She is convinced, that she never realy needed them. But
    the doctor told her to take them. Is is possible that there is a connection
    with Thyroid hormones taken for a long time and breast cancer?

  • 
    Jennifer
    March 2013 Flag
    Johan's reply to your queries mentioned that thyroid or circulation
    problems are the causal factor for breast cancer. So I think there is a
    connection. But not sure if he means just the thyroid function or the
    hormones.
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    March 2013 edited March 2013 Flag
    There is a strong connection between Thyroid function and (Breast) Cancer. 

    The Thyroid is responsible for growth, and if the Thyroid is
    malfunctioning, cell growth might go wild. At first, Fibroids and/or Polyps
    will be formed, and then under pressure these benign growths are turning
    malignant and become cancerous.

    A Whiplash condition, because of causing the Thyroid to malfunction, can
    thus lead to Cancer. 
    Other causes for Thyroid imbalance are: Pineal, Pituitary or Parathyroid
     Dysfunction, Tonsil problems, or Iodine (metabolism or shortage).

    Medically one only distinguishes over- and under-function. Malfunction is
    not a diagnoses that is used by the medical establishment.

    TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) is created in the Pituitary and the
    problem might also lie in insufficient production of this hormone.
    A receptor problem of the Thyroid might also be the cause.

    Thank you for your answer Johan!
    We had a longer brake of one month and started treating again. Session Nr 9

    Answer to Question 2 above: She has no constipation. She had diarrhea,
    green color. Now ok, no digestive problems. I think the diarrhea comes from
    her special anti-cancer-diet (dr. Johanna budwig). I measure many drops on
    the large intestine meridian every time. Appendicitis always works



    Johan's comments make absolutely sense to me :


    1. I guess the real cause of her breast cancer is heavy stress -> Adrenal
    glands


    2. Malfunction of Thyroid – OR - long intake of syntetic Thyroid hormones
    (this is a big difference)


    3. I do not measure Whiplash condition but treat her for Whiplash anyway


    4. No drop on Pituituary gland -> So the problem was maybe caused by the
    syntetic Thyroid hormones? Or, as Johan writes, a receptor problem of the
    Thyroid.
    Grateful for any assistance

    You do seem to be overlooking something.

    If you continue to be measuring Appendicitis, there must be Chronic
    Appendicitis or Appendicitis Necroticans.
    There are also drops on the Lymphatics, which almost always indicates
    Tonsillitis/Chronic Tonsillitis 

    The Small Intestine on the right hand could be Duodenitis, Gastritis, Ulcus
    Ventriculi or Duodeni.

    Thyroidea I only sometimes use to support the gland but not to correct a
    drop. So I use it mainly as support. A drop there can be caused by
    Pertussis or by Tonsillitis (+Chronic). 

    Appendicitis and Tonsillitis often go together and might continue to
    re-infect each other, which might be the reason why you measure it all the
    time

    Thank you Johan. 
    Your answer helped a lot and there was a big change after treating her with
    Appendicitis Necroticans and Tonsillitis

    Further Information:
    Since January I treated her 13 times.

    Symptoms Before Treatment: 
    Always Tired, Pale, Very Cold Hand and Feet, no YANG. No other symptoms...

    After the 11th Session, I noticed a change in her Appearence.

    Current Situation: 
    Much more „Alive“, Happier, Very Warm Feet and Hands, much more Positive!

    Questions:
    1. I treat her every two weeks. Since she feels good now, I suggested her
    to have longer periods in between, but she wants to have still treatment
    every two weeks. (She still does not want to see a docotor, only Treatment
    with Biophotons) What would you suggest? How many treatments make sense?
    And what period in between?

    2. My Treatment and Measurements are not consistant at all I think (see
    below) and I would be grateful for assistance.

    3. Since she has no Symptoms anymore (after 11th Session, even the fatigue
    is gone).
    So I can’t treat her for symptoms, only for what I measure, while I have no
    indication whether the Tumor shrinks or is getting bigger. 
    This makes it a bit difficult, because I do not « see » if we are on the
    right track.

    4. I have no indication, if it is a Cyst or a fibroid, since she started
    out with many drops on both Circulation and Thyroid for several Sessions.
    But the last 4 Sessions, almost no drops on Circulation and no drops on the
    Thyroid.

    11th Session

    Measurement + >12 Year Program:
    Insulin (L) - no match
    Thymus (L) - no match (tried Little Flannel Flower and Selenium)
    Thyroid - Put "Thyroid S" = Natural Thyroid Hormone in the Cup
    Circulation (L) – Barijodeel
    Kidney (L) – Salmonella Thyphi
    Kidney / Bladder (R) – Myom Uteri
    Small Intestines (R) – Appendicitis / Appendicitis Necroticans
    Heart (R) – Aesculus / Selenium
    Stomach (R) - Campylobacter Pylori

    Footplates:
    Circulation - Circulo
    Small Intestines – Listeriose
    Heart - Calmia Compositum / Lymphomyosot
    Nervous System - Cuprum
    ???? - Berberis (forgot for which point)
    Visum / Thalamus

    After Treatment every Point Balanced....



    12th Session:

    Measurement + >12 Year Program:

    Insulin (L) - no match

    Bladder / Kidneys (many drops) - Calculi Renales, Calculi Bil
    Sex Glands - Ovarium
    Tyroid – Tonsillitis
    Adrenals - Berberis
    Circulation - Circulo
    Kidneys - Barijodeel
    Gallbladder - Biliary Cirrhosis

    Footplates:

    When Kidneys have many drops AND Large Intestine reacts to Bact Proteus =>
    Put ALL 4 Intestinal Bacteria in the slots => See how many points balance
    because of this.

    When the Large Intestine reacts to one of the Intestinal Flora Bacteria,
    generally all four are needed.

    When these Bacteria are not in the Intestines anymore, they often have gone
    to other places in the body where they don't belong and creat problems.

    All four Intestinal Bacteria Nosodes can be used for two purposes:
    1. Stimulating their occupancy of places where the Bacteria belong
    (Intestines)
    2. Removing the Bacteria from places where they don't belong

    not faster... every day around 11 in the morning for 1 or 2 hours. 


    Measurement:

    Adrenals - Anti-Tetanus
    Circulation (L5) – Injeel Chol / Barjodeel

    Comments:

    There was no need for the Intestinal Bacterias this time it seems... 


    Questions:

    1. Do you see a correlation between the change in Heart beat  and the
    Treatment, or Breast Cancer?

    2. How many Treatments make sense?

    3. Still confused about my Measurement. No consistency.

    Hello,

    Johan in your response to Alexandra on Mar 5 regarding a woman with breast
    cancer you asked Alexandra if she had tested the person to see if she
    actually has cancer (that many medical diagnoses are misidiagnosis).
     
    How do we test to see if a person actually has cancer?

    Thank you.

    Alexandra:
    To get back to you post of may 26 (Johan only reviewed your measurements
    and didn't answer your questions....)

    1. Going over your initial post again I notice that your first (8)
    treatments were not focussed and with too many Remedies and Treatments.
    This way the sessions were not very effective and I would not include them
    in your counting..

    The Breast Cancer is a Cyst (you measure Mamma Cystica)..... and in order
    for the body to heal this condition, Circulation has to be functioning
    correctly. 
    In your measurements it shows that the Cause is still not gone since the
    Adrenals and Circulation/Veins still drop. 
    Gallbladder, Circulation (Veins) and Adrenals first have to be completely
    fine for the problem to really resolve.
    As long as this is not the situation, she needs one treatment a week....
    and attention has to be paid to her stress level and lack of energy. Find
    out what is causing this.

    I don't know how many times you have treated with Barijodeel to address the
    Calcifications, but I notice you still measure it. When there is
    Atherosclerose, it might take 8-10 times of consequently treating with
    Barijodeel for it to completely resolve, depending on the severity of the
    condition.

    2. It is very hard to comment on inconsistency of measurements, when I'm
    not physically there to observe your measuring. 
    Regarding consistency of Treatment I would suggest to focus on the
    Circulation (Veins, Adrenals, Gallbladder/Liver)
   
    3. You didn't see any symptoms anymore before, but now she has the change
    in Heart Beat.... 
    Rhythm disturbances, and also Blood Pressure changes are caused by the
    Gallbladder system... It might be that you have treated Liver or
    Gallbladder (I don't see your 13th Session) without supporting them.
   
    Palpitations (change in Heart Rhythm) are often experienced by a person as
    an extra strong beating of the Heart.
   
    4. Considering:
    * your overall measurements with many Circulatory drops, 
    * Barijodeel that is needed, 
    * Adrenals that are exhausted, 
    * Gallbladder that is stressed (Palpitations), 
    * Mamma Cystica matching on the Breast Point
    I do think you are dealing with a Cyst.

    Thank you very much for your support Karolina!

    1. I treated her with Barijodeel about 5 sessions. Circulation was always
    bad. After what I learned now I also think it is a Cyst -> thus
    concentrated on Circulation. Now, almost no drops anymore. No cold hands
    and feet anymore.

    Last treatment yesterday. Nr 15

    Measurement:
    Almost no drops.
    Hormonal System - all fine.
    Liver - never has drops
    no drop on Kidney, Bladder Stomach, Spleen

    Gallbladder - one drop
    Circulation - one drop
    Veins - one drop
    Heart, Lymphatic System and Lungs (new!) - most drops

    So measurements are still confusing to me. I intended to concentrate on
    Circulation, Adrenals, Liver and Gallbladder, but there was almost no need.

    Symptoms:
    The good thing: she feels very good. No complains at all. Heart beat also
    ok.

    Measurement:
    Heart (L-3)
    Organ Degeneration (L-3)
    Veins (L-4)
    Lympathic System (L-1, L-3)
    Circulatin (R-3)
    Heart (R-6)
    Gallbladder (R)

    >12 Years Program:
    Circulation / Veins - Chelidonium
    Heart - Staphylococcus
    Circulation / Organ Degeneration - Mamma Cystica, Carcinoma Mammae (no drop
    on Breast point this time)
    Gallbladder - Adenoma Gallbladder
    Campylobacter Pylori (Not sure, where I measured that)
    Lymphatic System - Staphylococcus Aureus

    2nd Measurement:
    Small Intestines (L) - no obvious drop, but sounded like low energy on all
    point
    Lungs (L)
    Small intestines (R-6)
    Heart (R-6)

    Footplates:
    Small Intestines - Nux vomica
    Lungs - Tuberculinum / Tuberculinum Bovinum
    Heart - Coxsackie A9 / B4 / Lymphomyosot
    Selenium
    Galium (for support, to help the body get rid of toxins)

    3rd Measurement:
    No drops anymore

    2-7 Program:
    Circulo, Glyoxal, Aesculus, Berberis, Populus, Solidago, Atropinum, Hepar

    Question:

    1. Since I treated with a lot of Nosodes, I used an additional 2-7 year
    program with support remedies, Is that correct?

    2. I read in one of your comment, that you should not treat the Liver in
    the first few sessions (there was no need until now), and that the Liver
    takes part in almost every illness. Is it possible, that the Liver "hides"
    its problems? Should I start to treat first Gallbladder and then Liver
    anyway?

    3. I measures almost no drops on the "important" meridians / organs. How do
    I treat then?

    1. There should be only 8 Nosodes used and then you can use 8 Supports. If
    you happen to use more Nosodes, then the Support should be for the Organ
    System that needs most support. Otherwise use Kidney, Lymphatic Support.
    In general do not use a third treatment.

    2. The Liver normally is under such stress that it masks its problems by
    Endorphins. only after a number of treatments is the liver detoxified so
    much that the stress is gone and then it shows itself.
    You always have to treat the Yang organs first and then the Yin organs.

    3. According to your measurements you have plenty of drops on the main
    meridians. So what do you mean?
  •

    Thank you Johan

    To Question / Answer 3: With main meridians I mean the Yang-Meridians and
    the Meridians, who shoud be all fine after the treatment (Hormonal System.
    Circulation, Kidney). 

    More detailed: I measured not many drops on the Hormonal System (0 Drop),
    on Bladder (0 Drop), on Gallbladder (1 Drop), Stomach (0 Drop), Small
    Intestine (1 Drop), Large Intestine (0 Drop). Most Drops were on Heart,
    Lymphatic System and Lungs, only one on Veins, Circulation and Organ
    Degeneration. For this Meridians I needed a lot of nosodes (but mostly to
    correct only one point). Compared to the first treatment, I think I
    measured not many drops anymore.

    Hope, this makes more sense

    Hormonal System, Kidneys, Circulation,and Yang Meridians,  are the first
    organs to focus on, but in the end all Meridians are important! There is an
    initial emphasis on the Yang Systems because the Yin Organs can't heal
    without these Eliminatory Organs working properly... 
   
    Since you figured "Circulation, Adrenals, Liver and Gallbladder" should
    have focus (because of the symptoms), and since they still have drops
    (Liver is probably still "in hiding"), Johan writes " you have plenty of
    drops on the main meridians" to work with.

    The main meridians that are indicated for the Symptoms your client
    experiences still show imbalance so there's still work to do and there
    might still be something in the Breast. Not the time to stop treating...

Bush and Bach….

February 2013 edited January 2014 in Biontology Insights Flag

I have a client with symptoms of Fibromyalgia. She has low blood pressure at
rest and sometimes when rising,(100/67), then it will shoot up to 130/90 just
getting out of bed and walking to the kitchen . 

Personality: She is a caretaker of others and has lost her Father and sister
this last year. She took care of them. Her brother-in-law is now dying of
cancer and her other sister had a stroke.

Last measurement, drops on: 

Thyroid point

Insulin point

Adrenals

Appendix point. 

Nervous System - point second one down from hand. 

The feet did not show a drop

Measurement and treatment:

I used Flower Remedies to calm.

Thyroid point: Lyme's Disease and all other points cleared with this too

Other Remedies used in the hand treatment: Trichonomaden, Tuberclinum,
Toxoplasmosis, Tonsilla Compositum, Mezereum, Graphites, and Candida. 

Footplate Treatment: 

Cerebrum, Thalamus, Viscum, Bact. Proteus, Bact Coli, Bact Lactis, Bact Pyo. on
Foot Plates and changed out Fringed Violet ,Rescue Remedy, Pink Mulla Mulla ,
Grey Spider Orchid for the last 2 minutes. 

Should I do more with Gallbladder even though it did not show ? Should I have
tested further remedies for Gallbladder even though all points cleared and were
strong with the remedies I used? Should I be looking at a Calcium issue when
the Parathyroid does not show. She had a whiplash in the past. Also she does
not sleep at night.

Thanks in advance for your help Lora

    Bush & Bach and Footplate treatment:
    I know some practitioners and teachers have misunderstood the effect Bach
    and Bush remedies can have on the treatment. And I'm using this forum to
    set things straight.
   
    The Bush and Bach remedies should never be used in a set of 8 at a time and
    especially not before you've measured anything. Your whole diagnoses will
    be changed and not accurate anymore. 
    Bush and Bach remedies are supportive and should only be used at the end of
    the treatment on the footplates and even then only use one or two that are
    very specifically chosen or even better, measured. As with all remedies the
    rule is "less is more". To find one remedy that is closest to the cause is
    far more effective than to have this one flower remedy included in there
    with 7 others.
   
    I've copied from another discussion on the forum:

    "Bush and Bach remedies mask. 
    Drops that should be treated with nosodes will be energetically corrected
    by the flower remedies, but the physical reality of infection/inflammation/
    illness will pull the energetics back if it is not properly treated with
    nosodes. So do not mask things with Bush and Bach remedies."
   
    I also want to advise you to look into the measurement protocol I've sent
    around. It shows you what to look for first.
   
    Another misunderstanding is to put Viscum, Thalamus and Cerebrum in as a
    standard procedure on the footplate treatment of a regular session. This is
    only done in Dyslexia treatment (so for the actual condition dyslexia).
   
    To answer the questions:
   
    If there was Whiplash in the past and the calcium metabolism is corrected
    now you can still find calcium build up (stones, calcified arteries and
    tissues) that have to be "cleaned up". I don't know if that's the case with
    your client, this will show up in the measurements.
   
    The blood pressure problem is caused by both Adrenal exhaustion (low blood
    pressure) and Gallbladder problems (survival energy to go on without "real
    energy")
   
    Fibromyalgia is a Liver/Gallbladder problem. All symptoms of Fibromyalgia
    are caused by Liver and Gallbladder. The Liver can hide, but the
    Gallbladder generally doesn't so then you should distrust the measurements.
    The Gallbladder is either producing endorphins (very rare!) or your
    measurements are off.
   
    Regarding the measurements: 
    It might be that you put too much pressure on your probe and don't measure
    drops on the feet because of that. The feet are often moist and then need
    less pressure. 
    You don't have to measure very fast, when you're learning it is better to
    hold the probe for a little while. Not seconds but long enough to stabilize
    the probe and hear the drop. Your hearing and feeling has to adjust to this
    and then in time and with experience you'll be able to do it faster.

    "Another misunderstanding is to put Viscum, Thalamus and Cerebrum in as a
    standard procedure on the footplate treatment of a regular session. This is
    only done in Dyslexia treatment (so for the actual condition dyslexia)."

    Yet in the treatment protocol you state: "For a client’s first session it
    is important to use Viscum, Thalamus and Cerebrum on the footplates to
    support the recovery of pineal gland, pituitary gland and nervous system.
    The treatments after that they are facultative and can be used according to
    insight and measurement."

    Is your first statement above Excluding the first treatment?

    February 2013 edited February 2013 Flag
    I see in the protocol I only mention to use them in the first treatment. I
    still use Viscum and Thalamus frequently in first session, since the first
    treatment always has the hormonal system as the main focus... So supporting
    the Pituitary and Pineal glands in this situation makes sense to me....

    But it is not a rule and you have to judge every session again what you're
    going to support. Awareness of why you make certain choices is important.


    Thanks again! You make good observations and I love that you address them
    right away, I really need that kind of feedback.

    When I read the protocol again I noticed that I wasn't really clear on
    children's treatment either.

    The Dyslexia Program in itself is not dangerous with remedies, it won't
    give too much of a remedy. This is what I meant that there's no danger of
    overdose with this program. However if this is used as a second treatment
    in children, using too many remedies can overdose a child. 

    It is best to only use one hand treatment and if a second treatment is done
    with either rods or footplates they should only be used with very little
    remedies or even none.

    Hi Robin

    If the points are dropping sharply like with a Spin Inversion, then it is
    energetic and then you can try Fringed Violet. But there is always an
    underlying cause. 
   
    If they do not drop sharply, then try the nosodes first.

    If Fringed Violet match those two points, is it then okay to wait and put
    it on the footplates. Then you have place for 8 nosodes in the first
    treatment.

April 2015 - EMF Sensitivity

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
April 2015 edited April 2015 in Q&A Flag
The following question has led to a very long discussion on the forum, which is
really good because it makes clear that there still is a lot of
misunderstanding about what Spin Inversion actually is and what it is caused
by. Because the information about this case was spread over several posts
Karolina has tried to make a summary of it.

Question
All sessions with this client were done in a low EMR environment. After 8
sessions all complaints were gone except for some EMR sensitivity. The 9th and
10th Sessions were only assessments and no treatment was given, since there
were no more drops. I wanted to see how his body would react to a high EMR
environment and 4 hours after the initial measurement in low EMR environment,
where there were no more drops, I measured him again in my high EMR office with
wifi etc. This second measurement I found 70% points dropping. My thinking is
that this is caused by EMR in my clinic/office setting.
Probably you would say that I did not find the root cause…
Additional information: This client does have multiple small metal stents in
the abdomen after surgery.

A. How do you find the root cause when clients no longer have drops? 

B. I wonder how often we are measuring environmental exposures. When drops can
vary according to environment it makes it difficult to understand when the
biophoton series is done. How do I know?
It seems to me some of the drops we measure in indoor settings are actually a
reflection of room exposures. I often measure outdoors and I'm wondering if I
need to add a measurement when I think they are 'done' with their biophoton
session series in their home/office/school setting after 4 hours of exposure to
see if they are strong enough to 'withstand' these environments.

C. Do you think that it is necessary to check my clients in a high EMR
environment to see if they are strong enough to withstand daily exposures at
home/work/school. 

D. I have also done Electron Spin Inversion measurements of people with their
smartphone on their lap-so far most go into Electron Spin Inversion except for
one man. I find this interesting but I'm not sure of the clinical implications
because when people use their phone it is against their head BUT often it is in
their pocket- near their thigh. If they go into Spin Inversion each time then
of course ability to self heal is impaired. What do you think about this
experiment?

E. Is this a client who needs to limit their exposures permanently because of
the metal stents?

F. Any other advice?

G. I am really confused...  
If Wifi weakens the system and causes aura problems AND drops the Spin
inversion points, there needs to be yet another discriminating analysis as to
what is the cause. So the question: does Spin inversion treatment correct the
points when aura weakness is actually the problem? If so then one would have an
Aura Masking. It would seem to me then putting Ozaliet as a support would be
best in this case. 


Answers
‪A. By investigating EVERYTHING, no matter how unlikely.‬ You would need to
measure ALL KINDS of fields that exist, both in the client and in their
environments, this includes the earth magnetic field
‪One can only definitely find out what the root cause is by researching every
move in the client’s life and measuring all possible fields and radiation in
all their environments.

B. At any one moment the environmental fields and radiation can change
dramatically, based on the solar wind and the earth magnetic field. The
situation in California is critical since it lies near or on a fault line that
reacts more severely to solar winds. Since we are near a high of the solar
cycle. One needs to really monitor all conditions continuously.
There is a lot of solar activity lately, which exposes one to much stronger EMF
than the usual office environment, but your client did not show any drops for
two weeks before he went into your office. This makes me think that the
situation is not at all that serious anymore… Possibly if he goes home he is ok
again. If this client is completely symptom free, why would you want to do this
experiment anyway?

C. Even if a client is strong enough at any one moment, it is only a picture of
a moment. No matter how good a client is at one moment, it does not mean that
he/she is strong enough at the next moment. He/she can be weaker the next
moment/ the field can be stronger, the radiation can become stronger or weaker.
There is no way to set a standard, everything is relative. So I don’t see value
in this particular experiment. You should just tell your client to come back to
you whenever symptoms appear again.

D. It is not Spin Inversion that you have tested but aura weakness. Spin
Inversion will never be caused by cellphone radiation but aura-weakness may be.
You will measure the same drops, but they may be corrected as soon as the
disturbing source, in this case the cellphone, has been removed or, if the
exposure too this source was too long or the body was too weak you will need to
correct the drops with Ozaliet or Montmorrillonite. Aura drops can also
disappear with a Spin Inversion treatment, because of the treatment with the
own blood, but Spin Inversion can never be corrected with remedies.

E. Every metal acts as an antenna for certain frequencies. What frequencies
they are depends on the length, diameter and shape of the antenna. In other
words it depends on the stent itself.
So there is no way of telling in advance. We do not know what frequencies are
in the air and what frequencies will be coming.

F. EMR sensitivity is a symptom. And as long as there are still symptoms
present someone is not ready to stop treatment. The absence of drops should be
considered a measurement problem.
But it all depends on what you consider EMR sensitivity. One will usually feel
something during exposure to electro magnetic influences. But if you recover
quickly afterwards and are able to handle continuous moderate exposure then
this is not EMR sensitivity.
When there are still the symptoms of EMR sensitivity. Adrenal problems are most
likely still present. Then you have to look at tension, stress tolerance,
ability to deal with emotions, lifestyle, rest-activity ration etc. But as said
before, you really have to do your research thoroughly. You may have overlooked
something.

G. The spin inversion treatment could also treat an aura problem but in this
case it is not the spiral that does the work, but the blood.
I agree that Ozaliet would be discriminating between Spin Inversion and Aura
problems. If you find the relevant points dropping sharply, you can try to
match Ozaliet. If this matches you need to treat with it before going any
further in measuring. A short treatment would be sufficient. But you must not
forget the cause of the weak aura. You can put energy remedies in with the
Ozaliet.
Spin Inversion cannot be corrected by remedies, since they will have an
opposite effect to their normal action.
Energetic drops caused by an aura disturbance may disappear the moment you
remove the cause. This can be energetic jewelry, crystals, cellphones, glasses…
etc. A Spin Inversion never goes away just like that.


I will try to explain the cause of Spin Inversion again.
Spin Inversion is caused by an (electro) magnetic FIELD not by electromagnetic
radiation. A cellphone will not cause Spin Inversion, but a MAGNET will.
Frequencies can disturb the aura though and this will cause many steep drops.
This is however NOT the same as Spin Inversion.
I will try to explain it in a different way. A magnetic field whether caused by
electricity or something else can make a compass needle turn. Cellphone
radiation will not do this and thus is NOT a direct cause for Spin Inversion.
The irritability and hyperactivity that Stefano described on the forum as being
caused by EMF is not because of Spin Inversion (one does not become hyperactive
from Spin Inversion) but because of its effect on the protective layer of the
body, which is the aura. When everything comes in unfiltered one gets
irritable. So electro-magnetic frequencies also affect the Liver/Gallbladder
system.

Vaccination Removal

June 2013 edited January 2014 in Biontology Insights Flag
A regular client of mine wants to bring her 16 month daughter in just to have
her Vaccinations treated.  

Questions:
Can I just do the ones she was given with in a <2 program on the handrods. 
Or, do I measure the Triple Warmer and give her what she shows for?  
Also if I do just one treatment, can it be all vaccinations?
Should I put her on the footplates for as long as she will stay?

    hmmm, not sure about that, thanks tho'.  Johan say one can always put in
    Polio, Anti Tetanus and Pertussis as a given for Vaccinations and the
    footplates if a child will sit still. But will wait to hear the official
    word. since I am just not quite sure.

    Since we don't "remove" Vaccinations, but deal with the disturbances they
    have caused, it of course is best to always measure for what actually is
    needed. The body always shows the imbalances that needs to be addressed
    first... 
    Another thing is that even if you have addressed the Cause (Vaccinations in
    this case), you have to work on the Consequences in the body too! Organs
    that were affected in their functioning by the Vaccinations, might have
    developed some "stubborn" problems that are not directly balanced by just
    treating with the Vaccinations themselves.

    However if you still don't want to or are unable to measure... 
    Experience has taught that Anti Tetanus and Poliomyelitis always show up
    initially and Pertussis is also one Vaccination/Childhood Disease that is
    measured frequently (Pineal & Thyroid). So it would be a good "guess" to go
    for them first.
    Never treat all of the Vaccinations/Childhood Diseases at once though,
    because it leaves you not enough space (only one short hand treatment...)
    to properly support Kidney, Lymph, Liver (Solidago/Populus, Lymphomyosot,
    Hepar...).

    The Footplates can be given to any child that can sit still for some time,
    but don't put anything on it, especially with a child that small.

    Treatment without measuring will always be less effective, and if you can
    explain that to the mother she will probably allow you to do a proper
    session or maybe several. With a little child you are done within a few
    minutes....

    Thanks Karolina,

    I appreciate the insight. No I would never put all vaccinations in 8 slots.
    I'll see if I can measure her if I have time, she added the little girl to
    her appointment, so we may not have time. If not, ill do the big three and
    give supports on the under 2 Program.Then the little girl is leaving with
    her grandma for a while. So, if not tomorrow, measurements next time.
    I do know we don't "remove" :-). just didn't think to use the correct word
    ( cognis essence)

    Question regarding the protocol:
    19. "For a client's first session, which is hormonal system as it's main
    focus, one can use Cerebrum, Viscum, and Thalamus on the footplates to
    support recovery ...."
    Is it very strict rule that Cerebrum, Viscum, Thalamus has to be given
    during the first session or it is still plausible to do it during second
    session?  Sometimes I have really difficult time to balance a person's
    energy body within the first session, too many things are out of balance
    and .... looking back I see that sometimes I give "The 3" remedies during
    second session. I understand the point of recovering the hormonal system
    first but sometimes there is such severe inflammation in addition to Triple
    Warmer problems  (Appendicitis, Tonsillitis, Kidney, etc)  that in turn
    affects Triple Warmer if not taken care of... so I do it during second
    session when Triple Warmer seems to be doing much better or recover
    fully.... Or, by doing this I slow down the body's recovery?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    Yelyena:
    Since there was a lot of confusion about the combination Cerebrum, Viscum,
    Thalamus and many practitioners developed an attachment to using them on
    the footplates every single time, I explained how these remedies could make
    sense as a support in the first treatment... However this combination is
    never a must except for the Dyslexia treatment (= in case of real
    Dyslexia...).

Re-exposure Magnetic Fields

Candace Hsiao Young
January 2015 edited February 2015 in Spin Inversion & Cause Flag
It is very challenging in some places nowadays for clients to stay out of Spin
Inversion

Questions:

1. Would you mind explaining once again exactly what happens when a Spin
treatment stops working due to re-exposure to strong magnetic fields - if
client gets into Spin Inversion again shortly after treatment?

2. Would remedies/nosodes used in client treatment session act truly in
reverse, or in other words, would client be energetically exposed to the
diseased inverse of the remedies used previously for treatment?

    Answers:

    1. If a client gets into a Spin-Inversion shortly after having been
    treated, then the treatment stops working. Normally a treatment will
    continue working for about 3 days.

    2. If a client is in Spin Inversion, the body works against itself. The
    body will not react to ANY treatment, OR act in an opposite way (this is
    not the same as remedies being inverted).
    There is no way of telling in advance what way a body might react. Overall
    one might say that the body does not react, but there are exceptions and
    then there is an adverse reaction.

    I find that I often get back into Spin Inversion soon after my treatments.

    Questions:
    1. If I give myself another Spin Inversion treatment to correct this, would
    the treatment then resume its effectiveness? I have tried this and it seems
    to work.

    2. How often can Spin Inversion treatments safely be given.
  • 
    Candace Hsiao Young
    March 2015 Flag
    Yes, I am also confused about this. Although I may not have learned this
    from Johan, I was told by others to run the spin program 2X if the client
    is exceptionally weak while measuring each time to see if points improve.
    Running once does not always seem to immediately improve the dropping six
    points.

  •

    Hi!
    When you write "I have tried this and it seems to work"; do you mean, you
    first measured drops, then did the Spin Inversion treatment and then
    measured the drops were corrected again, just like at the end of the full
    treatment? If you measure the points corrected after the treatment, I would
    assume the full treatment is still in effect.

    Whenever a client is in Spin Inversion, it is very helpful and safe to run
    the Spin Inversion program.

    If it isn't clear if someone is in Spin Inversion, then it is still safe, I
    believe, to give a Spin Inversion treatment.
    Just remember, every light treatment, including Spin Inversion Program,
    will start a detox, so as long as this person is getting full regular
    treatments, this is safe. If someone hardly or never had a Chiren Treatment
    and only uses a Chikey, running a lot of Spin Inversion Treatments and thus
    activating the body to detox, could maybe be too intense for the unready
    organs.

    If someone has already purchased a Chikey with the Spin Inversion cup.
    Should we recommend they hold off from Spin Inversion treatments until
    measured by a Biontologist? 
    This information seems not to have been made clear...is it in the
    instructions included with each Chikey?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    March 2015 Flag
    The idea was that practitioners would give clients specific instructions
    with each Chikey. It is impossible to give instructions for every single
    situation, since there are no recipes.

    Answer to your question:
    In general one can do a Spin Inversion treatment without being measured
    before, but when the issue is not resolved afterward or one reacts
    adversely (what many of you call detox), one should visit a practitioner to
    be measured. The problem may not be Spin Inversion at all... how do you
    know this without measuring?

    If someone has already been measured and treated, and it is clear that
    there are returning Spin Inversions, the Chikey can be used for Spin
    Inversion treatments in between sessions until the source has been
    eliminated. But even then care should be taken to not use this program
    recklessly and to give the body plenty of time to deal with the detox and
    it is best to also give a supportive card with Kidney remedies. 


    The Chikey was introduced as an extension of Biontologists practices, but
    because even with the Chikey, answers always need to be adapted to the
    personal situation of a client, too much support was and still is needed.
    It is impossible to make the Chikey cost effective because of this. 

    Chikeys are now solely sold through practitioners, who are expected to deal
    with answering therapeutic questions and providing information themselves.
    There will be no new Chikeys after this batch is gone.

    For long term storage of a remedy can 100% Vodka be used?  (80 or 90 proof
    vodka undiluted with water).

    Most vodka is made from genetically modified and heavily sprayed corn.  Is
    this a concern?  I'd appreciate a source for organic, or at least non GMO,
    vodka that can be purchased in the U.S.

    Since Vodka is distilled alcohol and in the process of distillation all
    information is lost as it is in distilled water, there is at least no
    concern for it to be contaminated with information (of toxic genes or
    insecticides). 

    Chemically after distillation all that should be left is the alcohol… 

    Also, the biofeedback circuit of the light prevents harmful information
    from coming in, as long as you use both rods.

    Fantastic!

    The link above recommends 20% alcohol in 80% water for the rare instance
    that someone might make an oral remedy that will be consumed over a few
    days time. 

    For backing up remedies, for LONG TERM STORAGE, in small vials: I recall
    Johan saying that there needs to be some molecules, such as salt, in
    regular tap water to hold the information.  Very purified water like
    reverse osmosis don't have those molecules.  Because vodka is distilled and
    highly purified:   Does it have enough molecules to hold information
    without being diluted?

    Thanks Karolina, That helped me figured it out. You have to use a chip
    card, you have to identify the chip card to the Chiren. Then you use both
    footplates to load the card. After the card is loaded you ask the Chiren to
    read the card, and it done. 

    I copied several remedies by pouring a little homeopathic liquid on the
    footplate and as well as wiping the remedy off the footplate, I ran light
    via the neutralization program to clear the footplates completely. Do you
    think that is necessary or am I being overzealous?

    2)How long will a remedy last in each type of liquid storage? 

    3)Do we need to keep making the remedy over and over again? 

    4)Do they expire at a point and no longer hold the information?

    * Long term storage is best done in a saline solution. I have remedies for
    more than 30 years and they are still effective.
    If I use distilled water, i always add some salt grains into it before
    transferring the information.

    * Any type of alcohol solution degenerates over time. I have no idea what
    ratio of water and alcohol lasts longer.
    Wodka or Cognac can be used in the ratio 20/80, the 80 being distilled
    water. But this does not last as long as saline solution,
    If you use alcohol, you must use ethanol, the only alcohol that is fit for
    human consumption.

    Johan has mentioned that a 9% saline solution works well. This can be made
    by:

    American:  Dissolve 1 measuring teaspoon of salt in a cup (8 fluid ounces)
    of very hot water
    Metric:  Dissolve 9 grams of salt in a liter of very hot water.

    Use distilled water or reverse osmosis purified water.

    Use ordinary table salt (Sodium Chloride) that is Non-Iodized.

    Johan, you mentioned above:  "I have remedies for more than 30 years and
    they are still effective."

    Because the Chiren did not exist 30 years ago, I’m assuming they were made
    from the original substance.

    How long will a remedy that is copied via the Chiren’s light, into liquid
    vials, for long term storage last?

    Will they last as long as ones made from the original substance? Or are
    they more like an electronically imprinted vial with a shorter life span?
    What would be their approximate expiration date?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel

    These remedies were indeed made from the original substance, but they were
    also all injectables (ampules) made of salt water solution. The salt is
    what holds the information. The original substance is not present anymore
    in these homeopathic, diluted/potentized remedies. Only the information
    stays.

    The information transfer through light is of high quality and remedies made
    by the Chiren, in theory, should keep as long as the original remedies. Of
    course this can only be tested over time, but Starlight therapists have
    been able to use their self-made remedies for many years without them
    losing strength.

    There is no other way if you want to have the remedy included in your

    Answers:
    1. I released the list of remedies I was working on early because there was
    so much pressure (gossip and rurmors creating dissatisfaction). It was not
    at all ready, and you can consider it a draft version of a small section of
    the remedy book. I only included Cadmium because I found some good
    information about it and had it as an added remedy in my own Chiren at the
    time. I, however, never needed it and Johan did not see any relevance
    either in adding it to the standard list.

    2. Niccolum was not part of the standard remedies in the Chiren at the time
    and was only added in the latest update. It is also not a remedy that you
    will often use, but it may be instrumental in relieving Nickel allergy
    along with working on the underlying causes.

    I can see that in this particular case you may want to use the Cadmium
    remedy though. I don't know who still has it. It was given to some people
    in the initial classes given in California... it was a combination remedy
    of Cadmium and Strontium. Maybe someone on this forum can help you by
    creating a card and sending it to you.

    According to a Genova Nutra-Eval blood test, cadmium was identified as the
    single highest heavy metal in my blood. Not long after this, a Clifford
    Compatibility test performed by a holistic dentist reported nickel
    sensitivity in me. I realize I am commenting on seemingly irrelevant
    diagnostic medical tests but find it interesting that both these tests
    raised my awareness of two of the newer Chiren remedies. Perhaps, they are
    both very much in our modern environment.

    What is most abundant physically may not be the biggest disturber. In my
    experience Cadmium hardly ever matches or corrects anything significant.
    Nickel is sometimes used when there is a sensitivity, but also very rarely.

    The main focus should be on the meridians and what remedies are needed to
    correct them. If at one point you have corrected everything, and especially
    the excretion organs are in order, you can treat with a remedy like Cadmium
    just for your own peace of mind. But personally I did not see much effect
    of this remedy in anyone. Don't let this distract you too much.

    I had burned out after treating myself and family members for six months
    last year. Since then, I have only treated myself twice and administered
    Chikey spin, scar, and 2-5 treatments on myself, my son, and some friends.
    My schedule and lifestyle have made it difficult for me to treat others,
    including myself. Despite mistakes, I was able to clear severe hand eczema
    on myself from treatments performed last year--this was a condition I had
    suffered with for over a decade. I suspect the Liver meridian plays a large
    part in my issues. For years I have been waking up between the hours of 1am
    and 3am.

    My path to healing and a full grasp of Biontology has been slow. I have
    experimented with qi-gong, acupuncture, chinese herbs, food therapy, and
    osteopathy this year--finding Chiren self-treatment difficult to schedule.
    My full intention has always been to come back to it once stronger and in a
    more stable routine.

    I have also been working out important life issues that required my full
    attention before I could promote healing in other ways--very possibly the
    result of unmasking from my very intense Chiren treatment cycle last year.

How often Should you Treat when you Measure an Infection?

    Hi Liselotte, 

    Difficult to reply with no information but I treat every week at least the
    first three times. try to repeat the sessions within 7 days. Sometimes
    within 5 days but difficult for some people to organize. 

    After the three sessions I always try to organize to treat every week, if
    you see the infection or other dysfunctions are better you can also put a
    week in between. 

    when I'm finished and let patients go, I always ask for them to come back
    in 2 moths to check if everything is still in order. I call it an APK:)
    most of the time the patient thinks that's very nice, some people are very
    uncertain.

    hope you can do further with this answer?

    Hi Liselotte,

    Chronic Appendicitis and other infections/inflammations are very common and
    they fit within the normal treatment protocol. 

    So treating the way Judith described is best. This way you won't overburden
    the body and have enough continuity for the client not to fall back in
    between treatments.

    So to clarify,
    Normal protocol is :

    And sometimes treat every 5 th day.

    Yes you're understanding it right. 

    Only the first two treatments are 4-5 days apart, but for the following
    treatments once a week is the protocol.

    Every 5 days would be an exception.

    I understand it like this:

    The first 2-3 treatments at 5 day intervals, because in these treatments
    you're mainly balancing the Triple Warmer, and it is very important that
    the Triple Warmer is balanced and not falls back

    Then once a week until everything is balanced, and the client feel healthy.

    How often can one treat with support remedies? When they're measured out
    and match?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    February 2013 edited February 2013 Flag
    I always try to match nosodes. And usually don't match that many support
    remedies by measuring. 
    They're just used when I have balanced the points with nosodes and then
    feel one or two organs could do with a little support.

    Like if I matched Ulcus Ventriculi on the Stomach, then I might give the
    remedies: Chelidonium, Erigotheel and Muscosa as support in the Footplate
    treatment. 
    If I have seen Liver Cirrhosis, then I give Hepeel and Hepar as support. 

    I very often give the next remedies as general support: Populus, Hepar and
    Lymphomyosot for general help with the detoxing. These remedies support the
    general detoxing organs.

    Of course remedies like Barijodeel and Aurumheel are not nosodes, but
    combat the calcification of the vessels.
    For the Circulation meridian we do not have nosodes.

    The protocol is treatment once a week with nosodes and supports. 
    Extra treatments hold the danger to overload the body.

Adding New Remedy With a Card

Question
Could anyone please send me instructions of how to load a new remedy once it is
on a Chiren card?

    Sondra - Check out the Manual. Everything you need to know is there with
    detailed instructions. I think I saw something here on the Forum, too. Do a
    search and you should find what Karolina wrote a while back when someone
    else asked this question. It's so easy... Just in case you don't find it:

    1) Put the card with the remedy you want to put into the Chiren (chip
    facing you and hear it click in the slot)

    2) Click OWN REMEDIES

    3) Click READ

    4) Remedy is now in the Chiren in OWN REMEDIES and will appear with all
    other Remedies, too.

    5) Remove card. You cannot use that card again to change the remedy. It can
    only be used by someone else who wants that in their Chiren.

    Please be sure that the remedy you are adding is TRULY of value to your
    clients and not something that someone just thought would be good. Keep in
    mind that herbs and supplements are not working that way to put into the
    Chiren. It must be high-quality homeopathic liquids or done properly (as
    the Manual instructs) for anything else. Also, keep in mind that when you
    start adding remedies, they also affect the memory in your Chiren. Unless
    they are really important and Johan has told you they are, I wouldn't do
    it. We have so many remedies, and you can always put a clear vial with a
    remedy in it with the Cup to treat with if absolutely necessary (although I
    doubt that).

    Hope this helps more than you, and hope what I wrote is 1000% correct,
    because this is what I read in the Manual and on the Forum, and is what I
    have done in my Chiren. Those remedies seem to work very well, so I am sure
    it's correct!

Protocol Questions

Protocol is Important!.

    I have some basic question for clarification.

    Questions
    1. When you say: "Populus and Solidago are good Kidney supports", do you
    mean to add them into the Footplate treatment to support the Kidneys
    weather or not they are dropping?

    2. When you say: "Clear the Kidneys..", do you mean follow Kidney protocol
    in the manual if the Kidney points are dropping and find what lifts the
    point?

    3. If the Kidney points are not dropping should I still use Solidago and
    Populus in the treatment?

    4. What if, for example, the Pituitary is dropping but nothing in the
    manual protocol will make it lift?  What should I do next?  Start trying
    supports?

    I had this issue today.  I was treating myself and am still unsure of my
    measurements.  Sometimes the Pituitary would lift and sometimes drop and I
    couldn't find a consistent remedy that would lift it every time I
    measured.  I'm guessing the main problem was my measurements.

    Thank you!

    I also just finished my training in September, and treat people every day
    now. I also have several questions. Sorry, my writing in english is not so
    good, reading is getting better! 

    Questions
    A. How do I know when the Kidneys are in a very bad condition, apart from
    when there are signs of arthritis/rheumatism?

    B. When, for example, most Kidney points are dropping, but a Bacteria
    nosode makes those drops disappear, does this mean that the Kidneys are not
    bad?

    C. When the Kidney stone point is dropping, does this indicate that the
    Kidneys are in a bad condition?

    D. Does the sound of a drop or the number of drops tell something about the
    condition of the Kidneys? 

    E. When the Kidneys are in bad condition, the first session, can I treat
    all the needed vaccinations and the Kidneys? Or the complete Hormone system
    and Kidneys? Or the Kidneys and Anti-Tetanus and Poliomyelitis?
   
    F. Are there supports (Compositae or Homaccords) that we can not used
    together, because they have a negative effect on each other?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    October 2015 edited October 2015 Flag
    Answers to Magdalena's Questions
    1. yes
   
    2. when you measure drops on the Kidneys, you first try to find nosodes,
    then add Kidney support on the footplates. As long as you are not certain
    of your measurements you always have to add Kidney support.

    3. If the Kidney points are not dropping it might still be advisable to add
    at least one kidney support, because with all treatments, the detox will
    increase. Some times the Kidneys do not drop one week and drop the
    following week. In such a case, most of the time the drop is caused by
    toxins that got stuck in the Kidneys. In such situation you can measure
    support remedies on the kidneys and in that session support the Kidneys
    with more than one remedy. Perhaps it is even advisable to not treat
    anything else. It depends on the condition of the client.

    4. If the Pituitary drops and "nothing" (not the normal remedies) will
    bring it to balance, one needs to go to abnormal remedies like toxins. You
    could for example try Formaldehyde or Dioxin. Sometimes also remedies like
    Appendicitis or Tonsillitis match. 
    But the Pituitary point, just like most proximal hand points are not the
    easiest points to measure for students. 

    If it sometime matches and other times drop, it is very possible that it is
    caused by your measurement which might be not so stable. If for example you
    change the angle of the probe slightly you already get a drop. Next time
    you measure you might not change the angle and the point is stable. Also
    make sure that the pressure is constant because if you release pressure
    only a bit, you get a drop
  •

    Answers to Babette's Questions
    A. there are symptoms that could indicate that the kidneys are not
    functioning properly and there are the measurements. The measurements only
    tell you that there is a problem. It is difficult to tell if it is a very
    serious problem
   
    B. The condition of an organ is indicated by the measurement before any
    treatment is done. Even if the drops are gone at the end of the treatment,
    you need to wait until the next treatment to see if the Kidneys have
    improved. 
    If you find all Kidney points dropping then you can say that the whole
    Kidneys have a problem. If then one or two bacteria are solving the
    problem, then the problem is solved for the moment. But then you have to
    think about how these bacteria got there and from where they came. And then
    you have to solve that. Because as that cause is not solved, the bacteria
    might keep coming.

    C. If only the stone point is dropping, I would not say that the Kidneys
    are in a bad condition.

    D. A drop indicates a functional disturbance, and the bigger the number of
    drops, the more aspects of the Kidneys are disturbed. There is no
    indication as to how bad the disturbance is.

    E. I would in that case treat with Poliomyelitis and Anti-tetanus + treat
    and support the Kidneys

    F. No, I have never encountered that problem.

February 2013 edited February 2014 in Symptoms Flag
Client:
Man, not yet treated.

History:
Accident with fork lift => drove over his leg
3 weeks later => Bone Necrosis

Symptoms:
Bone Necrosis of his Leg  

Hospital diagnosis:
Bone not broken => he was sent home with painkillers => after 3 weeks back in
hospital with excruciating pain => bone necrosis, doctors can't help anymore

Situation now:
They might have to take the leg off

Questions:
1. What kind of a treatment should I give him after I have finished to do the
normal protocols?

2. What remedies could be good for this?  

3. Should I use Scar Treatment on the infected area, and then with what
remedies in the slots?

    Answers:
    1. You would need to check the Cartilage and Articular Degeneration
    meridian to see what matches.

    2. If there is Necrosis, there is likely an ongoing Inflammation. You could
    try Appendicitis Necroticans. Based on the similarity principle this could
    match.
    If it is not an Inflammation/Infection, you would only get Necrosis by
    total lack of Circulation. 

    3.You can use the Scar Treatment on the affected area. Scar treatment is
    done without remedies.

    When the tissue is meant for the body to get rid of anyway, there's no
    problem with giving a biophoton treatment.
    Only when transplants are put in a crucial place or have a crucial
    function, than it will be very dangerous to correct the immune function of
    the body. But in this case there's no harm in restoring self healing
    ability.
    The body might speed up the absorption process, but you can never predict
    the exact response.

    Also, do not trust your measurements. They are not reliable, there are far
    too few points dropping.

    DennisOwensDennisOwens

    I assume that after the first treatment many more points may drop as the
    body begins to relax.
    Thank you for the clarification about pig tissue.

    Symptoms:
    Heavy Bleeding - past 2 months 
    Cramping and Back Pain - left Lower Abdominal Area 
    Frustration 
    Regular Menstrual Period, but PMS (Cranky + Headache) couple of days before
    it starts.

    Medical History:
    Ovarial Cyst removed in 1991

    1st Session:

    Measurement:
    Many drops everywhere except for Heart and Kidney.
    Whiplash, Spin Inversion  
    Scar Treatment for Surgical Scar (Lower Abdominal Area, Cyst Removal) =>
    resulted in Kidneys dropping on both feet.

    >12 Year Program:
    Triple Warmer (L) - Poliomyelitis, Anti-Tetanus, Little Flannel Flower,
    Selenium, Berberis
    Triple Warmer (R) - Pertussis
    Appendix Point - Appendicitis Necroticans
    Lymphatic System - Chronic Tonsillitis

    Footplates:
    Cerebrum, Viscum, Thalamus, Tonsillitis, Cystopyelonephritis, Belladonna,
    Myristica Sebifera, Atropinum


    2nd Session

    Client Feedback:
    *Saw a doctor within 72 hours after 1st treatment.
    The bleeding had not stopped so a Hysterectomy was scheduled. 
    After 72 hours however, there was almost no bleeding anymore. 
    *She has no PMS Symptoms (Crankiness, Spasms, Headaches), although she is
    in the time of the month they usually appear... (bleeding a lot the last 2
    month might have affected her Cycle though)
    * Sore throat (last couple of days)
   
    Measurement:
    Small Intestine (both), 
    Nervous System (both),
    Large Intestine (both),
    Lymphatic System (both), 
    Lungs (L) 
    Bladder (both), 
    Kidney (both), 
    Gallbladder (L), 
    Stomach (L), 
    Pancreas, 
    Liver (L)
   
    >12 Year Program:
    Triple Warmer (R) - Carcinoma Uteri
    Large Intestine (R) - Appendicitis Necroticans, Chronic Appendicitis,
    Appendicitis
    Lungs/Large Intestine - Tuberculinum
    Lymphatic System - Chronic Tonsillitis
    Kidneys - Cystopyelonephritis
    Bladder - Myom Uteri

    Measurement:  
    Nervous System, 
    Gallbladder, 
    Pancreas, 
    Liver, 
    Circulation
   
    Footplates:
    Circulation - Belladonna
    Gallbladder - Billiary Cirrhosis
    Pancreas - Plumbum
    Nervous System - Botulism
    Tonsillitis
    Hormeel
    Ovarium

    The Graph on Biofeedback program was in the upper zone, so I decided to do
    2-7 program in order to relax the body which is necessary for healing.
    Interesting, she is that kind of client that feels that she is falling
    asleep during the procedure (how stressed her body must be!)

    2-7 Year Program:
    Atropinum and Spascupreel

    Comment and Questions: 
    Carcinoma Hepatis matched on the Liver, but I do not think I should start
    working on her Liver before Large Intestine and Kidneys are in good shape
    and she is regular with bowl movements (now - not every day). 

    I can see that her body is dealing with multiple problems but ....Any
    suggestions?  we have one month...


  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    Reviewing your Sessions I notice that you don't use enough Support
    Remedies. 
    Although it is the Nosodes that initiate the biggest healing, Support
    Remedies are an essential part of the treatment too. When Organ Systems are
    treated with Nosodes and then are not supported properly they can get into
    trouble, but also the healing effect of your sessions will be far less. 

    You are right to wait with treating the Liver in this stage. However it is
    not necessary for a client to have a bowel movement every day in order to
    start to treat the Liver. 

    If you only have one month I think it is necessary to review all stress
    factors in her life too. Like you wrote... In order to heal one has to be
    relaxed...
    Regular movement without overextending herself might also be a good advice.
    Maybe she can take walks everyday to keep the energy/circulation moving.

    Thanks,
    I thought about this too and felt sort of squeezed to make right decisions
    given what seems to be horrendous inflammation in the body. But I do see
    your point re: healing effect.

    3rd Session:

    Feedback:
    Menstrual period on time, but unusually light and short (today was the
    third day).
    Cramping not as painful and not as frequent: on the scale from 1 to 10,
    went down from 10 to 5
    No heart palpitations,
    No headaches,
    Sleep: earlier and a bit better, but still not waking up fully refreshed
    yet (we talked about her environment - positioning of TV, etc).
    "Throbbing pain" in her feet (soles) during night time, did not improve.

    Measurements + >12 yrs Treatment:
    Small Intestine (L) => Salmonella Paratyphi
    Nervous System (L),
    Large Intestine (L+R) => Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis, Tuberculinum
    Bovinum
    Lungs (L) => Tuberculinum Bovinum
    Circulation (R),
    Lymph (R),
    Kidney (R) => Selenium
    Pancreas,
    Bladder (L) => Myom Uteri
    Galbladder (L) => Cholecystitis
    Stomach (L),
    Liver (L) ,
    Organ Degeneration (R)

    Support:
    Berberis - my choice as Adrenal support since Selenium matched on Kidneys
    today

    2nd Measurement + Footplates: 

    Nervous System (L) - 2 points => Aluminum
    Circulation (R) - Aesculus

    Solidago, Atropinum, Ovarium, Hormeel, Metro-Adnex

    Biofeedback program - the graph started and stayed in the lower zone.

    3rd Measurement - no drops

    Notes:
    Next session is schedules in one week and then I will know if it was indeed
    her menstrual period.
    I understand that the stress response that depleted her Adrenal caused/
    causes Kidney deficiency, so she needs constant support of Adrenal system
    (talked with her about necessity of potassium rich diet).

    Questions:
    1. Since she has Fibroid in Uterus I would like to see if I can match
    Polyps or just run the program anyway? 
    I would like to give support for Thyroid: Thyroidea and/or Strumeel
    (digestive problems).

    2. Carcinoma Uteri matched on her Triple Warmer (R) during session 2 but
    not session 3. I think I should continue to give this remedy together with
    Myom Uteri and Ovarial Zyst. Which programs, though (in case I do not match
    them to points on Triple Warmer or Bladder)? One round in >12 yrs and then
    2 to 7 yrs?

    3. Pain in her feet? any idea where it might stem from ? I guess, it is
    complex - Pressure (Gallbladder, Kidneys), Circulation. She is walking all
    day long during her work hours - works as a manager.
    Thank you!!!

Mycoplasma

m3pollack
December 2013 edited January 2014 in General Questions Flag
Thank you Johan, for the extensive discussion this afternoon regarding:

My friend with the son with advanced Lupus. I just called her to get more info.

Further Information:
* Age 8 he had "mycoplasma infection" in his ear => Dizziness now, is exactly
what he experienced then (28 yrs. ago).  

* The next major illness was mononucleosis => caused Tonsils and Spleen to
become severely enlarged. Tonsils (& Appendix) are still a problem.  

* Next, was psoriasis.

Then, lupus with inflamed G.I. tract, blood clot to the liver, "psoriatic
arthritis" with all joints distorted and in pain, "lupus gastritis," and "lupus
nephritis".

Question:
1. I did not find Mycoplasma in the Chiren. Is there something close?
2. Which Tonsil and Appendix remedies would you suggest I load for the Chikey??
3. You cautioned us not to use too many Nosodes, but then when we were talking
about this man (Rex), you said to load all 8 slots, with a separate card for
supports. I just want to make sure I understood you correctly and I don't
overburden his system.  

I'll wait for your reply before making the Chikey cards.

    Comments/Questions:
    * How do you know that Mononucleosis caused Tonsil and Appendix problems? I
    think that IF there is a connection, it is more likely that it is the other
    way round.

    1. In stead of the Mycoplasma, you can try Klebsiella Pneumoniae and
    Chlamydia Pneumoniae + Tuberculinnum
    2. For the Tonsil and Appendix card you use the remedies: 
    Tonsillitis, Chronic Tonsillitis, the 3 Appendicitis remedies + Anginheel,
    Tonsilla Comp + Chelidonium
    3. 8 nosodes are not too many, but you need to focus.

    Hi Johan,

    I coded all the Chikey cards and sent them out Express mail yesterday, but
    it was too late.  Rex died tonight.  His mom told me this evening that he
    simply "tanked" after I left.  Perhaps, it was the Chiren that had been
    stabilizing him last week.  Perhaps, I should have been more aggressive
    with the treatments, but in his extremely weakened condition, I was afraid
    of doing too much.  I feel if I could have gotten there perhaps a month
    ago, things could have turned around.  

    I thank you for all of your guidance.

    I am so sorry to hear that, especially for your friend. 
    But a more aggressive approach would probably not have made any difference
    for the better. 
   
    Treating in an earlier stage might have, but that is just speculating. It
    is better to let go and accept you have done what you were able to do at
    the time, and that it just was not enough for him to get better.

Biontology vs Traditional Chinese Medicine

    Question
    In Chinese medicine the Spleen is indicated as the reason for prolapse, but
    you mention the Liver as the cause. In general, how do you distinguish
    between this and the Liver as the reason?  
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    November 2015 Flag
    Answer
    Although I have used and implemented certain elements of Traditional
    Chinese Medicine in Biontology, just as with every other modality that I
    studied, most of it was discarded as useless to my practice. That is why
    you cannot compare Biontology and Traditional Chinese Medicine. 

    My whole system is experience based and is rooted in the application of my
    biophoton instruments... 
    The meridians of Spleen and Pancreas (both considered "Spleen" in
    Traditional Chinese Medicine) do not drop that often, even when there is
    muscle weakness or prolapse. 
    The Liver meridian, however, does show drops in these cases, and the moment
    they are corrected and stay corrected, the muscle problems start to
    disappear. 

    Maybe you can look at it this way: in the 5 element teaching the Liver
    negatively influences the Spleen. So even if the Chinese were right, it is
    still the Liver that causes the whole issue. But then again, the Spleen/
    Pancreas system does not usually show many or hard to solve drops.

    Yes. Intuitively, I feel Biontology works deeper, while Chinese medicine is
    concerned with the immediate issue. 

    If one looks at the Wood/Earth dynamics it can very well be Wood overacting
    on the Earth causing a 'thickened' energetics in the Earth resulting in
    failure to uplift causing a Spleen-Yang prolapse. 

    Initially, I see Chinese medicine allopathic, energetically, but once the
    immediate issue is resolved then the underlying or root cause is revealed,
    which is usually more of a nutritive and homeopathic approach.  So
    Biontology seems to have cut out the 'middle man'.

Preparing for Surgery

Jennifer IveyJennifer Ivey
May 2013 edited January 2014 in Medication Flag
My son (18 yrs old) is going to have four Wisdom Teeth removed. I still have
time to choose his method of Anesthetic. 

Medical History:
Noonan's Syndrome 
Pulmonary Valve Stenosis => corrected as an infant.

Questions:
1. Shall we avoid letting him go "fully under" if at all possible?

2. Is there anything I can do for him to assist his recovery? 

3. Of course they will prescribe antibiotics which I am guessing he shouldn't
take either?

    May I ask:
    Are the wisdom teeth all going to be removed at the same time? 
    And if so, is this requested by a Dentist or a Dr (due to his medical
    history)?

    In holland it is quite common to have them removed as needed, and it is
    either done at the dentist or if they are hidden at the hospital with local
    anesthetic, I had 1 removed at the dentist and 3 where removed by incision;
    1 appointment was one side upper and lower jaw, so i could still access my
    mouth to clean and drink through a straw on the other side and a year later
    i came back for the last one.

    Impacted wisdom teeth on the bottom - I saw the xrays. Not sure about the
    top 2.

    Recommended by his orthodontist - he has been followed throughout his life
    by the Dental/Orthodontic
    Division of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, where he had his
    Heart, Hernia and Ear Surgery when he was much younger.

    I understand that this procedure is "common" in North America, for no
    obvious reasons.

    1) Try local anaesthetics 
    2) Get a sample of the Anaesthetic and treat with Neutralisation afterward
    (only the session right after getting the Anaesthetic!)
    3) Treat with Belladonna against any Infections, plus Kiefersostitis. If
    you can try to get Belladonna Homaccord in drops from Heel, Germany 

    It is best if does not take antibiotics.

Hypothyroidism

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
October 2014 edited October 2014 in Q&A Flag
Question:
Is it possible for hypothyroidism to be healed by the body with Chiren sessions
alone, and without taking desiccated thyroid medicine? Can we give the medicine
energetically? Please tell method for doing this if it is possible.

Answer by Johan:
This is possible. Follow the protocol and when the Hormone System is balanced
at the beginning of the session improvements in Thyroid function will usually
follow. When the Thyroid hormone level becomes too high, the Thyroid medication
starts to work counter productive, so this is a good indication to lower the
dose… This is when you can start to lower the dose.
Measurements should be done before and after reducing the doses. The whole
Hormone System, but especially the Thyroid, Pituitary and Pineal should be
balanced.
If the Thyroid drops after she has reduced the dose, you should try to balance
it again.

    I find that Armor Thyroid and all synthetic supplements have a great
    potential to make the thyroid gland sick beyond the original under lying
    cause.

    So many times, I found that it takes a while for the thyroid to detox,
    regain its function and kick back in to action after correcting the
    underlying cause. This generally proves to be a jarring process for the
    client if the medication stopped or lessened during this process.

    I try, with good success so far, to mitigate this by replacing the these
    poisonous medications with all natural desiccated thyroid supplements that
    don't have any poisonous additives. Of course as always, I measure the
    relevant points with the supplements to see the appropriateness of this
    approach. This generally looks like the thyroid point drops with the
    medication they're using in the cup, and the same point gives a happy
    signal with the proposed new supplement in the cup. I always take this
    measurement after running the treatment protocol.

    I let them take this supplement for about a month and then ween them off of
    it, during which time the thyroid had a chance to recover and ready to
    spring into action.

    At least this is my thought process and the success rate is to be observed
    on a case by case basis.

    Has any one else followed similar approaches? Any thoughts?

    Personally I do not test any actual medication on points. What I sometimes
    do is make a remedy out of it with the neutralisation program so I can
    measure what this corrects.  This way I can see what organ systems are
    damaged by the medication.

    I do not know what you mean with a "happy sound", but I assume it means the
    lack of a drop. When the replacement remedy does not cause a drop in
    measurement the only thing you know that it the remedy does not disturb.
    You cannot tell this way if it actually helps.

    You also have to take into consideration that the remedy in undigested form
    is not the same as a remedy that already has entered the digestive system
    where numerous processes change the ingredients.
    The digestion of the substances can also disturb the Stomach or Small
    Intestine. If one wants to test a medication or a supplement, one has to
    test it on all organ systems.Very often a medication is "good" for one
    system but bad for other systems.

    I think the way it goes is like this:  you crush the item if solid and put
    it into water then put this on the 'clear' plate  and salted water on the
    light emitting 'blue' plate and run the neutralization program.  The salted
    solution is now inverted and can be used in the cup as a remedy or put into
    the Chiren as a remedy using the "make a rememdy' protocol....
    HOPE THAT'S RIGHT, Johan.

    By a "happy sound"(on my post above) I mean a little more than a lack of a
    drop. There is some times this enthusiastic "that's it!" type of response
    by the body when a solution proposed to a dropping point.

    Yes, I also measure with the neutralized information of the medication when
    I suspect a medication causes issues in the body, so same goes in case of a
    thyroid medication.

    Thanks for your input on this Johan.

    Referring to Hakan's post about substitution of medication for natural
    thyroid, this needs to be done by the patient not the Biontologist , unless
    he/she is an MD.  If the patient make the decision then you are in legal
    grounds.

Q&A - Extreme Fatigue

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
December 2013 edited December 2013 in Q&A Flag
Client:
Girl, 14 years old, 

Symptoms:
Too tired to go to school.
Two years ago the same complaints, treated by other practitioner (NL)

1st Session

Measurement:
Small Intestine (R) - 2 point
Circulation (L) - 1 point

>12 yrs Program:
Campylobacter pylory (balanced all drops)

Footplates: 
Aletris, China, Cocculus, Selenium, Tonico, Solidago, Viscum, Thalamus

2nd Session:

Measurement:
Small Intestine (R) - 1 point
Large Intestine (L) - 4 points 

>12 yrs Program:
Campylobacter Pylory, Salmonella Typhy (all drops balanced)

Footplates: 
Aletris, China, Cocculus, Selenium, Tonico, Solidago, Berberis, causticum,
olive

3rd Session:

Measurement:
Small Intestine (R + L) - several points

The girl is still very tired, most of the time nauseous, it seems the
treatments did not help. Next week she will come for the last time.

Question:
Any advise what to do?

    Some considerations:
    * The Small Intestine on the right hand drops every time. This indicates
    Ulcers or at least serious Duodenitis and/or Gastritis. These conditions
    have not been addressed and would have been found with the Measurement
    Protocol as your guideline.
   
    * Ulcers of course have a cause and it is not Campylobacter (Helicobacter)
    Pylori in my experience. Probably there is a Gallbladder/Liver issue behind
    everything and/or Adrenal issues. The nausea seems to confirm this

    * Support on the Footplates should reflect the issue your are focussing on
    in your treatment = you were focussing on the Small Intestine/Food
    Poisoning, but your Support did not reflect that.

    * When similar drops show up in the next treatment, and symptoms did not
    improve in between the sessions, the remedy you used didn't have the
    desired effect. So using Campylobacter twice for the same problem causes
    you to not get to the real cause...

    * Campylobacter (Helicobacter) Pylori is often found in Ulcers, but is not
    the cause of Ulcers. The weakness of the Stomach attracts/sustains
    bacterial growth.

    * Since the same drops on the Small Intestine appear every session it is
    very unlikely that the anaesthetics have anything to do with her problems. 

    * It is unlikely that all drops on the Intestines disappeared after the
    neutralisation of the anaesthetics.

    * I advise against randomly neutralizing substances. The safe way to
    neutralise is to create a remedy with the neutralisation program, then
    measure if it matches, and when it does, use it in a normal treatment with
    the two glass Rods. This way the filter guarantees that no damaging
    information is accidentally given to the body.

    * You skipped a hand treatment...

    Hello Johan, the mother of the girl told me that two years ago is was the
    campylobacter. When I used this nosode the drops dissapeared. But maybe the
    girl also had ulcers two years ago, so I'll measure again.
    Thanks for your reaction and thank you Karonlina for your help, Eeke

    The problem is the assumptions that are made by some therapists. 

    The proof that it was not the Nosode Campylobacter that was needed to
    resolve the problems of this girl is shown by the fact that it did not give
    any improvement. 
    Sometimes remedies do resonate, but don't solve the problem, since there is
    another underlying cause that needs to be addressed instead. My finding is
    that Campylobacter is never the cause even if it resonates.

    Usually therapists use far more than one remedy, and the practitioner this
    girl visited never leaves a slot open in her treatment. If then she
    concentrated on the fact that there were Ulcers or Inflammations (there
    can't be a bacterial infection without one of these) and she used the
    Nosodes for these too, of course she got results. Then she assumed that
    Campylobacter was the cause... but with so many remedies used it could have
    been anything, she has no proof for her assumption.
   
    Thank you for this case, since it shows clearly what I have trying to teach
    all along. It is not about the bacteria/parasites, it is about treating the
    underlying cause. Of course the Nosode of the bacteria can be of
    assistance, but it is not going to cut it by itself.

    Another point made by your case: never listen to diagnoses of other
    therapists/doctors. Listen to your client and make your own unbiased
    assessment.

Potassium

Renate
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Therapy Questions Flag
The only low potency of Potassium Phosphate in the remedy Selenium, that is
under a D10 strength, is D6.   Yet Cerebrum has two forms of low dose Potassium
Phosphate (D6 & D8) which is twice as many as the remedy Selenium.  Barijodeel
also has D6 potency of Potassium Phosphate.

There are many other forms of low dose potassium in the remedies Cerebrum,
Mucosa, Nervoheel, Aletris, Cactus, Cardiacum-heel, Cor Comp, Cralonin, Discus,
Osteoheel, Syzygium, Apis, Bronchialis, Testes, Tonsilla Comp.

It could be argued that Barijodeel with it's two forms of Potassium Phosphate
would be more supportive of the adrenals.  Or Aletris because it is an energy
remedy.  And so on.....

Why is Selenium the only form of potassium ever mentioned for the Adrenal
Medula when there are so many other low potency sources of potassium in the
Chiren?

    It has been my experience that it is specifically the remedy Selenium
    Homaccord that always balance the Adrenals and NOT any of the other
    remedies. 

    Plus the fact that Selenium Homaccord often balances other hormonal points
    too, while the other ones do not.
    Sodium/potassium balance is a complicated issue, so it might also be the
    higher potencies of potassium that have an effect. But it might not only be
    the potassium, it could also be the selenium or the combination that does
    the trick.

    I  thought we have Selenium remedy the way it is (with Selenium and
    Potassium) because it might have synergetic effect. It really works well
    but I sometimes wish to have remedy that contains only Selenium for
    measuring purpose only. 

    Long term Selenium deficiency might have crucial effect on many systems
    (Adrenals, Kidney, Thyroid, Pancreas, Liver, Lungs, Heart). Selenium levels
    was not tested in any of my clients where I suspected long term deficiency.

    Yelena:  It is possible that the selenium is not matching in your clients,
    with a known deficiency, because it is high potency and remedies above a
    D10 are often is used to remove information from the body.  There is no low
    potency selenium remedy in the Chiren.

    Because of the wonderful biofeedback component of the Chiren, the body only
    takes the potency that it needs.  Therefore, administering the Selenium
    remedy will no result in further selenium depletion in the body. 

    Most of the remedies in the Chiren are from the 1986 5th Edition Revised in
    2000 Heel Manual and before this information about potency was known. 
    Fortunately most of the vitamins and minerals in the Chiren are in the form
    of Composites which are typically low potency remedies and not Homacchords
    like the Selenium remedy is. 

    Brazil nuts are a good dietary source of selenium.

    Schwefheel and Psorinum are one way to attempt to unblock the body when
    there's Therapy Resistance caused by the Physical Body's inability to
    respond to the Energetic Body, but it is no magic bullet cure for all…. 

    It all depends on what the reason is for her none-responsiveness. 

    Can you tell more about the treatment? 
    What symptoms are there?
    What meridians were you able to correct? 
    Is the Hormonal System corrected?
    Is there frequent Spin Inversion?
    Does your client feel something happening during therapy?

    Client:
    Male, 70 years old. We had 4 sessions. He got ChiKey after 4 session to
    work on himself because he has to fly for Biophoton sessions.

    Symptoms:
    Urinary problems (since 17 years) => has to get up to 6 times a night
    Acidic foods (like lemon) => make him urinate more.
    Nose sniffles => irritated mucous membranes
    Sleep issues => he thinks it is because he takes naps during the day
    Bowel movements within the norm

    No improvement => urination issues, restless legs at night (Methadon),
    sniffing, neck and shoulder pain.

    Measurement:
    No Spin Inversion

    >12 year Program:
    Therapy Resitance => Psorinum, Schwefheel
   
    Lungs (L + R)
    Sex Organs => Adenoma Prostata
    Heart (R) => Plumbum Metallicum
    Veins (R)
    Circulation (R) => Barijodeel, Aurumheel
    Nervous System (R) => Plumbum Metallicum
    Large Intestine (R)  => Plumbum Metallicum
    Lymphatic System (R) => Plumbum Metallicum

    Bladder (L) => Sabal Homaccord

    Footplates:
    Billiary Cirrhosis, Calcoheel, Selenium, Berberis, Mucosa, Placenta, Nux
    Vomica, Nervoheel

    Results: Slight change in the ability to hold urine a little bit longer,
    especially at night (but he's not certain)

    Discussed with client:
    Spin Inversion, consequences and causes: 
    => might prevent the body’s ability to heal itself 
    => possible strong EMF in his environment 
    => airplane flights back/forth, 
    Liver condition might contribute too
    Maybe the Cause of the ailment was not revealed yet (suppression)

    He bought a ChiKey a month ago but still does not see changes in his
    symptoms.

    Chikey Cards used:
    Circulation,
    Bladder,
    Kidney.

    Results: No noticeable changes in symptoms for the past month.

    Hypotesis: 
    Restless legs = magnesium deficiency? 
    Inflammation of digestive track = side effect of Methadon 
    Hypomagnesemia, 
    EMF/radiation exposure (Causticum?) 
    Toxins in blood – Aesculus?

    Main problems:  
    Circulation (calcification, Kidneys, Gallbladder pressure, depleted
    Adrenals); 
    Liver Inflammation - Hernia, 
    Medication side effects?

    * Liver/Gallbladder is clearly the main issue => Sciatica, Bladder
    (sphincter) weakness, Muscle weakness (Hernia), Sleeping problems, Restless
    legs

    * There's suppression by the Methadon => Urinary problems/Restless legs
    become worse when he stops.

    * Because of the suppression you don't get a clear picture. 

    * Endorphins block Diagnosis, they do not block Treatment, It does not
    provide Therapy Resistance. But you did not address the Gallbladder
    sufficiently.

    * The Gallbladder needs far more attention (and when the Yang Organs are
    balanced the Liver too). It should be the main focus in your treatment.

    * Plumbum acts opposite to Methadon (lifts suppression), so this might be
    why you measured it on so many Meridians.

    * I would suggest him to stop the Methadon, since there seems no use for it
    anymore (no pain..). Only when he allows the symptoms (bladder weakness,
    restless legs) to surface the body will show the complete underlying
    imbalance and can start to work on them.

    * Is the clock radio still in the bedroom? Does he have spirals in his bed?

Hearing Restoration - Eyesight improvement

DennisOwensDennisOwens
May 2014 edited May 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
75 yr old Female

Biophoton history:
Very good results in overcoming digestive issues as well as coldness and
allergies with biophoton work.
11 sessions - broken into an initial 8 sessions with a 5 week travel break,
then 3 more.

Last Session Drops
Nervous System (L) 1pt (R ) 2 pts.
Circulation (L) 3 pts
Heart (L) 1 pt
Lungs (L) 1pt
Small Intestines (L) 1 pt

Ongoing issues:
Eyes Cataracts and short/near sightedness and astigmatism.

Hearing A hearing aid is used. (I have measured occasional Spin)
According to client - hearing issue is in the little "hairs" in the cochlea (in
the inner ear), some of which have apparently been worn down or broken. Hears
different-pitched sounds louder or weaker than others, i.e. at different
volumes or intensities, which makes listening very uncomfortable.

Minor issues:
Herpes - Some underlying herpes (oral) sensitivity -not an actual breakout but
feeling the potential for one.
Minor Dry tickling cough
Minor Hemorrhoids (seem to be going away)
Minor Hayfever (seem to be going away)

Questions:

Eyes: 
1. I have read earlier posts on cataracts and treatment with Veratrum. What is
the likelihood of improvement for the astigmatism and the short/near
sightedness using Veratrum drops or Chikey. 
2. Have you noticed better results with one over the other.
3. Are there any other remedies or suggestions for these eye issues.

Hearing:
4. Have you had success in repairing hearing?
5. Which nosodes / supports would you suggest?
6. Since Gallbladder has only shown up once in treatment # 7 and not returned,
it seems like Calcification/ Circulation may be most likely issue, is this
right?
7. If it is structural, i.e. the "hairs", What would you try?

Both eye and hearing issues:
8. Client would like to know what is reasonable to expect both time-wise and
effectiveness from biophoton treatments.

    1. All the eye problems you mention are symptoms not causes. Before
    treating with Veratrum will help everything else (the causes) needs to be
    corrected (Stomach, Small Intestine, Large Intestine….. the whole digestive
    system needs to be OK). 
    Since with a lot of Chikey clients this is impossible it might be better to
    use Veratrum drops 3 x daily for symptom treatment. Treating that much with
    the Chikey is not a good idea. 
    3. Short sightedness and astigmatism are muscle tension problems of the
    eye. You can work on Gallbladder/Liver

    Ears:
    4. Yes, with some but not with all. It all depends on what the cause is. It
    can be:
   
    => the acoustics of the ear, which might be caused by a calcification issue
    . In this case Discus, Calcoheel and Osteoheel would be indicated. 
    => Circulation, which also might be calcium related but can have other
    causes too. 
    => Inflammation/Swelling/Blockage
    => Nervous system defect
    => Lymphatic congestion
   
    The cause needs to be resolved first. ALL functional disturbances have to
    be corrected before any structural problems can be addressed.

    6. It seems curious that there was only once a Gallbladder issue, I would
    seriously doubt this measurement and as a consequence I would wonder also
    whether the Liver is suppressed. 

    7. I have no experience with that, but structural damage to tissue that is
    not likely to regenerate is not very promising.

    8. This is hard to predict. Only when all the functional problems have been
    addressed you could count on about 8 weeks for the eyes.
    But if the ear problems are caused by a calcium issue, it all depends how
    fast the body can build up and how much there needs to be built up.

    Hi Johan,
    I am posting the results of 3 sessions. One was before I posted these
    questions and 2 since

    Session 5/2/14
    1st Measurement:
    Small Intestine (L) 1 pt - Diverticulosis
    Circulation (L) 3 pts
    Large Intestine (R) 1 Pt. - Tuberculinum
    Nervous System (L) 1pt
    Heart (L) 1 pt
    Lungs (L) 1pt - Tuberculinum

    Other points were either cleared or ignored since I wanted to focus the
    session on Digestion and Circulation.

    I only used 2 nosodes in the standard treatment, because my focus was on
    the Intestines and the Circulation. I was trying to use only nosodes on the
    rods reserving the footplates for supports.

    Choice of Remedies on the Footplates:
    Herpes Zoster => client only mentioned the Herpes after the rod treatment
    Psorinum => to try to overcome any potential therapy resistance.
    Bronchialis => to help eliminate tickling cough
    Natrium => Hayfever
    Thyroidea => I thought I had heard this was useful for asthma and thought
    perhaps her ongoing cough might be related to asthma
    Hammelis => for veins, hemorrhoids
    Placenta => circulation / cold hands and general coldness
    Causticum => for potential of histamines and because she had just returned
    from a trip with a lot of airline travel

    >12 treatment
    Diverticulose, Tuberculinum

    2nd Measurement
    Nervous System (R ) 2 pts.

    Dyslexia treatment
    Psorinum, Hammelis, Bronchialis, Causticum, Natrium, Thyroidea, Herpes
    Zoster, Placenta



    Session 5/8/14

    Symptoms:
    Intestinal issues
    Coughing => if neck gets cold (always dressed very warmly)
    Hayfever => considerably better but still dry irritated eyes.
    Subtle sense of Herpes infection on lip but no breakout.

    1st Measurement:
    Small Intestine (L) 5 pts - Tuberculinum Bovinum (listed as a foodborne
    bacterial infection)

    >12 treatment
    Tuberculinum, Tuberculinum Bovinium, Herpes Zoster

    2nd Measurement:
    Large Intestine (L) 1 pt - Chronic Appendicitis

    Dyslexia treatment
    Pertussis, Chronic Appendicitis, Chronic Tonsillitis, Podophylum,
    Haemamelis, Mucosa,
    Thyroidea, Aesculus

    I only used 3 nosodes in the first Hand Treatment because only the Small
    Intestine dropped and no more were necessary to correct. I added Herpes
    Zoster because client mentioned that she felt a Herpes like tingling on her
    lip and had had a full blown outbreak while she had been traveling.

    Why Tuberculinum? 
    Client said that she feels a relationship between the beginning of her
    hayfever relating it to the loss of her mother and walking in a field of
    Hay that day. She brought me some pieces of the hay or grass itself. I
    didn’t have time to make a remedy at the time but recalled that
    Tuberculinum Bovinum came from Hay bales and thought it may be related. I
    added Tuberculinum without measuring in case there was a correlation there.

    Choice of Remedies on the Footplates:
    Pertussis => because of the coughing and looking back to earlier sessions,
    I couldn’t see that I had ever treated it yet she told me she had a
    whooping cough as a child.
    Chronic Appendicitis => measured on second round
    Chronic Tonsillitis => She had Tonsils and adenoids removed and I almost
    always include Chronic Tonsillitis if Appendicitis is showing up
    Mucosa => Support for digestive tract, respiratory tract
    Hamamelis => Haemorrhoids
    Podophyllum => Haemorrhoids and support Large Intestine
    Aesculus => peripheral circulation/coldness


    Session 5/15/14
    Symptoms:
    Runny nose => but feeling far better than in previous years.
    Less itching in sinuses
    Dryness much improved
    More tired than usual yesterday (however it was very hot and windy. She
    relates it to allergies)

    1st measurement
    Pituitary - Luesinum
    Thymus (R) - Luesinum
    Small Intestine (L) 2 (R) 2 Luesinum
    Large Intestine (L) 1 - Luesinum
    Nervous System (R) 2 - Plumbum
    Circulation (R) 1 - Luesinum
    Lungs (L) 1 - Luesinum

    I only needed these two nosodes to clear everything that was dropping.

    >12 Treatment
    Luesinum, Plumbum Met

    2nd Measurement
    Small Intestine (L) 1
    Large Intestine (R) 2
    Veins (L) 3
    Nerves (R) 1
    Lymph (L) Sinus & Pharyngeal Tonsils
    Organ Degeneration (L) 4

    Dyslexia Treatment
    Natrium, Oculoheel, Aurumheel, Mucosa, Little Flannel Flower, Hamamelis,
    Placenta, Circulo

    Why Luesinum:
    Luesinum – When I saw Pituitary and Thymus drop I tried this after learning
    in the Psychology class of it’s relationship to Fear. This woman had a very
    difficult childhood. 
    The fact that this nosode cleared nearly all points seemed to confirm that
    Fear is clearly an issue. 
   
    History:
    Childhood => Father had to leave family for extended periods of time.
    Mother needed to fend for herself and her sister. Sister had to be put in
    an orphanage. 
    Has lived in hot climates => Africa and Haiti, when her father was present
    and having to go to the cold north of England when the separations
    occurred. 
    Husband died => in her thirties, she associates this with cold
   
    Symptom:
    Although quite active, she is alone and has expressed that she has had
    difficulty maintaining close friends. 
   
    I believe part of what she is experiencing is psychologically induced Fear
    of Abandonment which she associates with being cold. 

    Choice of remedies:
    Natrium – for Hayfever
    Little Flannel Flower – for Thymus support
    Hamamelis - hemorrhoids
    Aurumheel - peripheral circulation 
    Placenta - cold hands and feet
    Circulo – cold hands and feet
    Mucosa – runny nose

    Comments:
    * If the woman has Hay Fever and has a Snotty Nose then I would definitely
    expect drops on her Lymphatic System.

    * If there is such a Fear problem, then I would expect drops on Kidneys/
    Bladder. 

    * With Hay Fever there are normally drops on the Bladder meridian. This
    would fit with your Fear diagnosis, but you do not know if the Fear is the
    original Cause or the Result.

    * If I find 5 drops on Small Intestine, I immediately go for Appendicitis
    Necroticans.

    * I also find it interesting that in the last session everything comes
    right with only 2 remedies, but after the treatment it seems that there are
    many points that have not come right.
    This means that either there is a measurement problem or she has a Spin
    Inversion,

    * Luesinum is a miasm, so it could theoretically affect many points, but I
    have never seen this.

The Value of the Protocol in Treatment

FeikoFeiko
October 2015 edited October 2015 in Interesting Cases Flag
The Value of the Protocol in Non Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment

Reading through the Forum lately I noticed that many beginning practitioners
seem uncertain in their ability to meet the sometimes serious diseases clients
have (or the diagnoses they have received).
This is only natural as we are accustomed to look at illness as a degenerative
process of the body, that needs to be suppressed, fought against or cut away as
to get rid of the problem, once being diagnosed. Yet illness is an expression
of underlying causes and in many cases a way of the body to cope, in keeping it
going. Many clients tend to identify with the disease they have been diagnosed
with. Yet disease being a symptom, the Biophoton practitioner's focus should
not be on the illness or disease!

Taking the symptoms into account the focus should be on what CAUSED the
symptoms.
In our practice Annette and me have seen many diagnoses with prescribed
medication causing new symptoms.
That is why it is important to look at the history of the symptoms appearing
and separate the initial causes from possible (side) effects related to the use
of medication.

What symptoms started showing up and in what order?
When did the initial symptom appear first?
Retracing back in time with the client will introduce both client and
practitioner with cause and effect. This is why we spend time with a client.

What is the cause of the symptoms that in time led to a disease or diagnose?
There are thousands of illnesses today, all given a specific name, yet they are
like the many leafs of a tree. The underlying disturbance is found in the
branches, maybe deeper, in the stem or trunk, or even in the roots and the
environment the tree stands in. Do not focus on those leafs. Forget the
disease. What is the underlying cause?
There are not as many branches as there are leafs. And there is only one trunk.
It is the same with diseases. There are many, but the underlying causes are
few, different systems being affected, and in many cases the root cause is only
one. That should have our attention.

Now, I'm very aware of the fact that we do not have the broad and deep
experience of Johan Boswinkel who developed this unique method and the Chiren,
but in the years of running our practice full-time we have gained much
experience that supports all Johan expresses in his teachings. And there is
only more to learn. Yet I would like to share one of our many cases to
illustrate that it is indeed possible to aid in restoring a client's health by
following the protocol, even when a client is diagnosed with a serious illness.

In August a man, 67 years of age, walks in with a diagnose of Non Hodgkin
Lymphoma metastasis, a cancer that has spread to the lungs and neck, believed
to have originated in the peritoneum where a growth of 6,5 centimeters (some 3
inches) gave rise to the urge to undergo chemotherapy as a last resort. The
client however refused such treatment knowing it to be very harmful to the
body.
He feels healthy, seems energetic, only a little tired more than before at
times, and has a very positive attitude. Nevertheless, all tests, punctures,
biopsies, scans, petscans and an ultrasound strongly support the diagnose
given.

Looking for a possible underlying cause we ask him about his circumstances and
the environment he lives in. He tells us he lives in small village in an area
with farmland, is a man of nature, a crane operator, used to be active in motor
crossing, a bit of a rough type, taking no shit from no-one, a righteous man,
who works with horses daily. With so much agriculture around we ask him: "What
crops are produced?
"Corn mostly."
"What kind of corn?"
"Modified corn".
"Much spraying going on?"
"Yep, spraying is done a lot. There was a huge bee population killed nearby
last year".

There were many drops on most systems on hands and feet in the measurement.
We treated a whiplash, he had made many falls when motor crossing and he was
kicked by a horse now and then, on the outside of the right knee and the left
wrist, that had sort of healed by itself. Also the scars from the ops during
testing had to be treated. He never had any vaccinations, at least he didn't
remember, except for maybe some flu shots. Following the protocol we decide to
put in Poliomyelitis and Anti-tetanus anyway, given his work with horses and
making sure the Pituitary will be doing its job.
Appendix needed attention and we put much support on circulation, lymphs and
kidneys.
At the second treatment kidneys had cleared. Circulation was much better, still
needed attention though, appendix improved, lymphs and lungs still dropping.
Tuberculinum was used clearing most drops, and we put in Tuberculinum Bovinum
as well.
At the third meeting with kidneys and circulation functioning, Insecticides
indeed matched, clearing almost all drops.
At the fourth treatment a huge improvement showed in the measurement, only a
few drops showed, aluminum on the bladder corrected them, the next day as we
later understood he had to empty his bladder many times, he kept drinking water
a lot.
At the fifth treatment 2 minor drops only, now we get the strong feeling this
man is well on his way back to health.
Within a few days he is to go to the hospital for an ultrasound to see if and
how much the tumor has grown and to then consider the options.
At the sixth appointment he walks in, takes a breath and states:

"All is gone. There was nothing to be seen on the ultrasound". He tells us he
asked the doctors present at his last visit in the hospital: "Are you sure?"
"O, yes we are", had been their reply,"it is not easy to overlook a tumor of
6,5 centimeters… There is no need to return. It is a total remission, we're
puzzled, yet sure. You don't have to come back".

In two and a half months since the diagnose, he was cured of cancer. His wife
upon being asked by church members - how this was possible - answered:
Biophoton treatment and a lot of praying".
To us however one of the most important reasons for his recovery, that we only
supported, was his attitude. He chose health over illness.
Maybe it was true that he had not received a polio vaccination, his Pituitary,
the general of the hormone system seemed to be well in the saddle from the
start, he knew what was the right thing to do. Not giving in to a diagnose,
instead following his heart and guts.

And he found the support, we as biontologists can give, by looking for the
cause, not the leafs.
Later he said to us: The best support I could get was what you said to me:
"Your body is working hard to get rid of the disturbance. Whether called cancer
or not your body is supported in fixing it". And it did.

Confidence expressed is aiding the client to have confidence. Confidence comes
from experience. Experience comes from treating as many clients as possible and
see the results. If you start with treating minor diseases or inconveniences
when beginning your practice, your confidence will build up. The word will
spread, and gradually clients with more severe diseases will come by the time
you are confident in knowing that there is a cause for every illness. When
finding the cause, even serious illnesses can be overcome. Go slow, be
thorough, expect nothing, promise nothing, ask questions, measure and stay open
to learning. Study every case, reflect on it and be confident.

Follow the protocol, every time you treat a client, as it is the foundation of
Biophoton treatment and over time you will learn WHY it is.
There is an order in nature as there is an order in the protocol. And once you
see this order you are well on your way to become a Biontologist.
The protocol was developed by Karolina in accord with Johan to aid
practitioners in more successfully treating clients. We are very lucky to have
been provided with what was developed after over 30 years of experience. Take
this to heart.


---------

Even though we have treated different clients with a diagnose of cancer before,
a Myoma Uteri, Adenoma metastasis, Lymph- and Liver cancer among them, this was
the first case in which the client did not follow any other alternative or
regular treatment before or during Biophoton treatments, nor did he take any
medication to suppress the illness or pain, underwent however tests with
radiation, biopsies, scans, pet-scans and echo's in order to trace, diagnose
and monitor the diagnosed cancer during his disease process until the
unexpected total remission taking place after 5 Biophoton treatments.

The case study will be shared on the forum at a later stage.

Newsletter

May 2013 edited May 2013 in Questions for the H.A.A. Flag
The newsletter from IABS has format .dat, which I tried to open in many
ways..... but it didn't work. (text editor opened it, but there are parts
missing and the text is all garbled) 

Question:
Can you please put the newsletter on this Forum? I know this is very important
to read!  
If not, is there a way to send it with a normal extension, like .doc, .pdf,
.jpg, .psd, etc.?

    Hi Kathryn,
    As far as I know Lillia sent out the text with the extension .doc. At least
    this is how I have received it and I could easily open it with Word.

    I don't think there's a way to post documents on this forum, so you'll have
    to ask Lillia...

    Question:
    Has anybody else experienced the same problem?

    Perhaps the person who creates the Lightnet newsletter could convert it
    into a .PDF file, and then it could be put on this forum as a link. That
    would make it easy for everyone to open, and then Lillia wouldn't have to
    send out so many emails? Just a thought.

    The file I received as an attachment has a .dat extension, which has been
    the case before with files I got from Lillia. I did a search on Google to
    find out how to open it, and it showed Notepad or a good text editor. I was
    able to do that, but all images and formatting disappear, and I feel like
    something got lost. For instance, did Johan write anything about the
    upcoming course with that great woman - which is mandatory for us? Is the
    course she does in Boston going to be on videophone for us to participate?

    Karolina: Could you please send me the Lightnet as you received it as a
    .doc file?
    Thank you.

    Oops. I wrote a comment here and then clicked on Write Comment by mistake

    How about this idea? The person who creates the Lightnet newsletter does it
    in a software program that converts to a .pdf file. If they don't know how
    to do this, I can walk/talk them through it. It's easy. Then a pdf page
    could be added to this Web site and have a link to it just for us in the
    Forum. That would be the easy way for everyone to get it without a glitch.

    In regards to pages 3 & 4 being gargled, I have to work with Johan on the
    formatting because I don't know what software/application he uses to create
    these documents.  I've noticed that text boxes show up on top of each other
    initially, but then it sorts itself out and is legible to read on my
    screen.

    In regards to the formats I send out, I only send them out in doc. or PDF
    format, but somehow it converts to some wacky wid format...  Some people
    receive them and others don't, its very frustrating.  Sometimes sending it
    the second time works. 

    We certainly need some IT specialist :) any IT help would be greatly
    appreciated, going loca with these techy issues.

    If someone can tell me what program Johan is using for Lightnet, I might be
    able to help. If you get it in WORD, you can easily convert it to a .pdf
    with a good (inexpensive) software. The best one I know is Docudesk's 
    deskPDF Studio X (http://www.docudesk.com/). This software can just about
    convert anything into .pdf, and it also converts .pdf into Word and other
    programs. It's the best one I've seen out there, and the people are very
    helpful.

    Let me know. I might be able to walk you through it Lillia - if you have a
    PC with Adobe and Word.

    Yes, the document does convert to an unreadable form. I receive it as
    winmail.dat file and when it is resent by lillia a second time for some
    reason it comes in ok. But this time it is the same as many of you
    described - garbled, with pages that overlap so we cannot read it and whole
    pages blank. Perhaps posting on the forum under IABS news would insure we
    could all read it, and we could refer back to them, as I know lillia has
    had to send out earlier issues again to some people.
    Thanks for helping solve this, I know it's frustrating for Lillia and those
    of us that cannot read it.

    On a brighter note, I want to say how much this forum helps the learning
    process - what an great way to learn from each case history! Thank you for
    doing such a great monitoring and answering questions with such depth.

    The best way is sending the file as a PDF.. It is easy to do.. if you need
    some assistance in doing this.. I would be happy to help. Also there are
    very simple programs, free, where you can upload the PDFs.. and it will
    provide you with the link to use in the emails to send out to everyone..
    therefore.. not attached file.. no problems with corruption.. or servers
    rejecting the file.. Attachments to emails.. often are caught by the spam
    filters today.. and if it is a .doc.. they are always suspect.. so many
    times.. you find the file corrupted.. A PDF file is the easiest method to
    use for now.. 
    I would be able to help the person in charge in setting this up.. Really
    very easy.

Red Bottoms of Hands and Feet

slevarekslevarek
October 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
60 yrs old man, totally into his health (lots of vitamins, organic living
etc...)

Symptoms:
Redness of palms of hands and feet (looks bizarre to me) => started recently
Frequent tightness in the chest

Medical diagnosis:
Many test to find the cause of the chest tightness (EKGs etc), but no medical
explanation

Medication:
PLAQUE-X (drip) => he was told this was the best for men his age.

Measurement:
Few drops, but still in a spin after 2 visits .. 

Inquiry:
Bedroom environment => sleeps on "magnet bed pad" now for over 20 years.. cost
him a fortune to have it made.  
Once the bed pad was removed, the next session, there there were no drops
anymore and no Spin Inversion.

Questions:
1. The redness is still there. My only guess is it would be his circulation..
which is where I did find drops. Am I on the right track working on
circulation?
2. Anyone else out there have similar experience with this? I would love to
hear about it.

    Hi Sandra,

    Interesting... can you tell me more about the hands and feet? Are they
    always red or does the colour change? Is there also swelling? Does he have
    sweaty hands/feet? Does he show other circulatory problems?

    It is always suspicious when there are still symptoms and no drops...
    Especially since this man has put his body under a lot of EM stress for
    over 20 years. Did you try to measure with Viscum+Plumbum+Atropinum or with
    Gallbladder nosodes?

    The 20+ year exposure to an EM field can be the cause of a continuing
    stress response (endorphins) in the body.
    Infusions (PLAQUE-X) are very stressful for the body too and can be causal
    in endorphin overproduction (mask) as well.

    When we suspect the presence of endorphins do we run 2-7 program with
    Viscum, Plumbum, Atropinum or Gallbladder nosodes and then remeasure
    everything or we put these remedies in the slots and measure with them?
    Thank you!

    I am going to try what you are saying
    Endorphins measurement..
    Gallbladder.. which I did see had drops.. 

    Medication this week:
    2 x PLAQUE-X drip => he wants to see me in between sessions.
    He is doing many -natural- things: drips, colonics every week..

    Symptoms:
    It is simply a reddish coloring of hands and feet, and yes he does has
    circulation issues.. 
    That was the main issue he had in my measuring him.. 
    I am sure it is calcification => have treated him 3 times for this
   
    Questions:
    1. Can you clarify for us the treatment for the endorphins in such an
    situation?
     
    I have another very physically fit man.. in his 50s.. who appears to be in
    such shape.. with no drops.. even after I did the
    Viscum+Plumbum+Atropinum.. 
    I want to be sure I am understanding exactly what I should be doing.. or
    what I should be aware of..

    Hi Sandra,
    I completely missed this last post, I'm sorry. Thanks Irina, for bringing
    it under my attention again...

    This client does several other things apart from the EM mat, that can cause
    Endorphin masking, like drips, colonics, etc. His body is probably in a
    continuous state of stress. 

    When measurement or a short treatment with Viscum, Plumbum and Atropinum
    doesn't work, you can try the Gallbladder Nosodes... 
    I usually first try measuring with these remedies in order not to lose
    information, which might happen when you treat with a short program. But
    when this doesn't work, then I run the short program with remedies.
   
    The Pituitary Gland is the organ that regulates Endorphin production, so be
    sure that you have at least treated with Poliomyelitis. We found out that
    this is sometimes forgotten in the first session, but it should always be
    the first thing to address together with Anti-Tetanus. When it is not
    measured in a client who did receive these vaccinations it is a sign that
    there is suppression.

    He had been in stress and fears for decades.

ADHD

peteralbpeteralb
March 2013 edited January 2014 in General Questions Flag
Client: 10years old with severe ADHD, not yet treated. He is medicated with
some depot medicine. 

Question: Apart from following the protocol are there any thing special about
these diagnoses you have to consider? In the old forum Veratum is suggested. 
I thought about the Dyslexia Program because of the inability to concentrate. I
think there must be some common issues about these clients.

Best regards Peter

PS If I cant measure him I will give him the 8-12 year programme without any
remedies.

    The first thing to consider is is hyperactivity. this is always a
    Gallbladder issue. Veratrum is not a remedy for this, I would only consider
    it if his eyesight is an issue.

    1) Clear the hormonal malfunctions.
    2) Treat Gallbladder issues for  hyperacrivity
    3) For attention deficits you can try Intestinal Flora or Tuberculinum
    4) You can do the Dyslexia treatment

    In ADHD the inability to concentrate is not because of Dyslexia. Try to
    find out exactly his behavior and what the symptoms really are.

    Thanks for advise.
    I didn´t believe in the Veratrum either. I am treating his twin sister for
    Dyslexia. So it might also help him to do the Dyslexia program. 
    They are 10 years his weight are 30 kg hers 55kg. He is living on pasta and
    soft drinks, so there are quiet sure some digestive problems too. He is
    considered a heavy case by psychiatric hospitals doctors. I will keep you
    informed.

    Also the 8-12 Program is never used anymore. For children till 12 years old
    the 2-7 years Program is always used

    OK What are the explanation for not using the 8-12 year program?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    March 2013 edited March 2013 Flag
    The 8-12 yr Program was created with the idea that older children might
    react better if treated in two steps, one with filter that only allows
    lower frequencies to pass through and one without filter. For children
    under 12 this doesn't make a difference though, introducing all frequencies
    at the same time as in the 2-7 yr Program is not a problem in their very
    flexible energetic systems.

    For adults however it is very important to slowly introduce the
    information. First the lower frequencies and then step by step a wider
    range of frequencies, until in the last step everything comes through. For
    adults the >12 Program (with 5 steps) is the only way the body will be
    properly prepared to receive all information.

    I wonder why you want to use an empty program before your measurement/
    treatment? The only reason I would advise this is to make it easier for the
    starting practitioner to assess what are the biggest problems, since all
    small drops will disappear. But using any program (even without remedies)
    before measuring is not good for your overall assessment, since you'll lose
    a lot of information this way. And it doesn't do anything for the patient
    that is extra helpful....

    The empty program was only meant as a possibility if I could not measure
    him, because of his ability not to stay seated for very long time.
  •

    Then, if there's no other possibility, you rather put in remedies according
    to his symptoms. Make sure to use Atropinum to relax him.

    I've seen the boy now and was able too measure him, but I had to do it very
    fast because he was very motoric restless. He was singing to the Chiren
    sounds (funny!) but I came through the measurements. I was not sure about
    all the measurements though.
   
    Measurement: 
    Circulation - definitely dropped (veins cold and blueish feet) =>
    Hamamelis, Mellilotus, Barijodeel
    Gallbladder - definitely dropped => Atropinum, Calculi Billiaris and
    Renalis
    Hormone System - not sure, but used Poliomyelits and Anti-Tetanus anyway 
   
    I did gave him a footplate treatment, but won't do it next time he has no
    dyslexia as his twin sister. 
   
    Medication: Methylphenidat18mg depot and Melatonin for the night

    Symptoms: boy is 10 years old and weighs 30 kg, constipation (due to eating
    habits), eats too little and unhealthy (medication takes appetite away),
    doesn't drink water, won't go to toilet in school, refuses to dry himself
    after toilet visit (so there's something going on here...), parents
    divorced 2 years ago.
   
    Changes: Saw the mother today and she told me he was starting to drink
    water that is new . 

    I see him again Friday and now I am prepared.

    Peter, I had a severely hyperactive 8 year old child diagnosed with ADHD
    difficult to measure because she couldn't sit still at all! 

    She was on stimulant medication dexedrine and parents wanting to decrease
    dosage. I found it was very helpful for her to sit in a padded rocking
    chair. This way she could rock & keep moving while I kind of managed to
    keep her hand or foot still enough to measure. 

    After 5 sessions she could sit still without the rocking chair and after 8
    she was able to play board games with her brothers for the first time &
    told me she had become happy. Ahh music to my ears :) So if possible maybe
    you could try a rocking chair?

    Also as you say, food additives, colorings, preservatives are known to
    increase hyperactivity in some of these children. So moving in the
    direction of less processed more wholefoods. (17 samples of processed foods
    with high fructose corn syrup were examined - over 30% of samples showed
    mercury contamination!) 
    So not only is high fructose corn syrup a bad sweetener But most is GMO
    corn and some of it has mercury in it! But these families overwhelm easily
    so limited advice slowly over time usually works best, but you probably
    know all this.

    Thanks Toril, very helpful advise! 
    We should all have a rocking chair in our therapy room ;-).

    And I agree with not overwhelming sick people with advise for healthy
    living. I think it is best to go step by step with introducing this kind of
    insights... When clients start to feel better, they are more capable of
    making healthier choices. And usually more willing too, because their
    improvement in health shows that they can trust you.

    Thanks to Karolina and Toril.
    I had the real first session with the boy friday. Now I was prepared and he
    too. It was much easier.

    Measurement:
    Lungs (both hands) => Staphylococcen, Staph. Aureus and Tuberculinum
    Large Intestine => Appendicitis Necroticans, Tonsillitis
    Gallbladder => Adenoma Gallenblase Atropinum
    Veins => Hammamelis

    program 2-7 All drops clear after treatment

    Changes: apart from the water, he is also started to eat more food.

    New information after talking with mother:
    Parents divorced, sexually abused by bigger boys. He often pies in bed
   
    Right now I am concentrating on the physical issue, but it gives me more
    insight to what he is going through..
    I seem to connect very well with him and that is very imported having him
    thrust me. 
   
    Talks about food will come slowly as he experience progress in his body.

    I would not discard Bladder/Kidney issues.

    The peeing in bed is always a Bladder/Fear issue. Lichen is for fear of
    abandonment, but using Plantago or Cantharis might be very helpful. But
    also the Adrenals will be affected.

    The ADHD issue is generally a Gallbladder issue but I doubt if it is an
    Adenoma.
    If you help the Adrenals, you automatically release pressure from the
    Gallbladder.

    2nd Session

    Measurement & 2-7 Program:
    Lungs (R) => Broncialis, Clamydia Pneumoniae
    Gallbladder => No drops, but treated with Atropinum anyway
    Veins => Hammamelis, Injeel Chol
   
    No drops after treatment.

    I will support the Adrenals next time and try Lichen as well.

    Changes: He still drinks water, and his mother tells me that he is starting
    to eat much more than before. He was quiet and easy during the session. 
   
    Question: 
    1. I have noticed that almost all the end points have very high sounds both
    on hands and toes. No improvement to his cold feet. What does this tell me?
    2. Mother is willing to cut back on medication but I think it is to early ?

    Try the Tuberculinum remedies. Tuberculinum is also indicated for cold feet
    and for ADHD.

    More information on this website.

    The high sounds could mean many things, it could be a return to good
    Circulation, especially after a treatment, due to relaxation.

    If the boy is quiet and easy during the sessions, I think reducing the
    Ritalin is wise.
    Let the mother reduce it by 25% and see what happens.

    In addition to the Tuberculinum remedies, you can try the Intestinal Flora
    for his concentration and attention.

    Large Intestines (R) => Bact Coli
    Triple warmer (LR)=> Anti Tetanus, Mumps, Rubella

    No drops after treatment.

    Changes: 
    He still drinks water, and his mother tells me that he is eating like a
    horse. He was quiet and easy during the session. His feet and hands are now
    nice and warm and no drops on Circulation!
    Talk with the mother about cutting back on medicine. The medications he is

    5. Session 15/5

    Measurement & 2-7 Program:
    Lungs (R) => Tuberculinum
    Gallbladder => No drops, but treated with Atropinum anyway
    Circulation => 1 drop Barijodeel, Aurumheel
    Triple Warmer (L) => Poliomyolitis, Serum Ovile, Selenium

    Support:  
    Lichen, Larch

    No drops after treatment.

    Changes:  Still very good appetite. He was quiet and easy during the
    session. He is also a much happier boy.

    6. Session  26/5

    He was not willing to corroborate at all. Had been with his father and was
    just coming home when the went to see me. That was not good, I did not know
    this, and talk to his mother about it. I mannaged to give him a treatment
    with the Chikey that he did not mind. Calmed down during treatment.
    Mother told me that he did progress in school.

    7. Session 5/6

    Came to me alone Mother came afterwards (5Minn) and was willing to begin
    measurement without her! We know each other now.
    Measured him and no drop except from two drops on lungs right hand
   
    Measurement & 2-7 Program:
    Lungs (L) => Staphyloccen, Streptococcen Virida, Tuberculinum and
    Tuberculinum Bovinum


    Support: 
    Selenium, Berberis, Larch, Lichen

    no drops after treatment

    He is not wetting his bed anymore, but his moods are up and down, apatite
    still very good.

    Question:
    How long time shall I hold on with him?

    I think there is a long way home, even if much is achieved, but is that
    Chiren work?
    I also think that the Adrenal support and the Tuberculinum might have even
    more time to really fold them selves out. 
    His family situation are not stable, so he is easily disturbed into old
    patterns. I have told the mother that I give him at least 5 more treatment
    ( I do this as charity  and experience for my self ) ADHD clients are not
    the most easy to treat, but I think many family's could benefit from this
    treatment, so someone have to do this.

    He was not willing to be measured so i just added

    Selenium, berberis atropinum and tuberculinum for the short program.

    I have a fine relation with him but he was stubborn in his attitude, so no
    forcing.

    I still need an answer to the Q. in session 7.

    As long as there's ongoing improvement you are on the right track. I would
    not look so much at an "end point". If there's still improvement you can
    continue to treat. However when progress is too slow, another approach to
    the problem might be needed.

    When there's only a short improvement and then the next treatment you are
    on the same level as before, you are only doing Symptom Treatment, so then
    there has to be more focus on the Underlying Cause(s) ... it seems there's
    some trouble in the relationship with his father?

    Divorced parents can be a huge stress for children, especially when there's
    an underlying tendency for the parents to blame each other and put the
    child in the middle... Little signs are enough for a child.

    Hi Megan,

    As you know, I'm still new at this, but bloating is usually a Gallbladder
    issue so you may want to look at those remedies. I would stay away from the
    Bush remedies for now since they can mask problems.  Just my 2
    inexperienced cents. Hopefully an expert will answer more thoroughly.

    Hi Megan,

    Sylvia is right and I would advise you to focus on the Gallbladder too. 

    The bloating is a Gallbladder issue, as is the facial twitching.
    Constipation can also be caused by Liver/Gallbladder since a healthy
    bile-flow is needed for peristalsis.

    I also wonder if you've already treated for vaccinations/childhood
    diseases, since you don't mention that in your case-presentation.

Chronic Stomach Problems

sallydyer
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
50 yr old female with an unhappy childhood. Mother tried to kill herself
several times during her childhood. Slept with an electric blanket for 4 or 5
yrs. (Has not used one in several yrs.).

Medical History:
Sinuses above her eyebrows never formed, Double Curved Scoliosis (at
12yrs), crippling anxiety (most of her life), self-medicated with pot, cocaine
and ecstasy (during her 20's), Anorexia (in her 20's), has had TMJ, Hep C (bad
drinking water), Polyps in her Sinuses

Medication:
Past: Effexor (depression), Ambien (mid 30's for sleep problems), Prednisone
and Steriods (asthma and sinus issues), Medication for Osteopenia (for 1 yr).
Allergic to Aspirin, Ibuprofen and Nsaids.
Present: Only Thyroid medication

Symptoms:
Asthma, Bloating, Heartburn and Reflux daily, Constipation, Bad Circulation
(purple toes, one foot hurts when walking, always cold, especially at night),
Tired off and on.

I have seen her a total of 4 times. 

The first couple of treatments: 
Almost all her points dropped. 
Spin-Inversion treatment at least 3 out of the 4 sessions. 
Treated Whiplash. 

I followed the protocol: 
Triple Warmer - cleared childhood diseases/vaccinations 
Kidney's - support
Circulation - Gallbladder remedies matched best 
Gallbladder - Cholecystitis, Biliary Cirrhossis, Adenomyose Gallenblase and
Chelidonium
Measured Chronic Tonsillitis and Appendicitis Necroticans several times.
Cleared many infections from her Small Intestine and Stomach.


Last treatment: # 4  
>12 Program

Triple Warmer (left) - Selenium, 
Triple Warmer (right) - Berberis
Large Intestines (both hands) - Gastritis
Nervous System - Formaldehyde, 
Liver - Zirrhose Hepatis, Hep A non B.  I had not worked on the liver until
this session #4. It just showed up.
Small Intestines (both hands) - Salmonella Paratyphi, 
Circulation - Calcoheel

Footplates: 
Right hand - Diverticulose, 
Lungs (right) - Staphlococcen
Supports - Solidago, Mucosa, Nux Vomica, Circulo, Galium, Aesculus, Atropinum,
Hamamelis and Apis.

This was her first treatment where her points were corrected with less nosodes
on the footplates. She feels good and her stools are becoming more regular. She
is tired often but she does lots of cardio exercise. I am working with her to
stop so her body can heal.

I am a new Biontologist and want to make sure I am on the right track and not
missing something. From what we have learned so far and what I read on the
forum sounds like her Gallbladder could be a main source of her problems? 
Could her scoliosis(back pain) flare during detox of her treatments? Any
insight  and direction would be very helpful.

    I find a lot of strange remedies:

    Triple Warmer (right): Berberis, on which point? The Adrenals are on the
    left hand.

    Large Intestines: Gastritis, this is very strange. Appendicitis Necroticans
    would be more likely. Or Botulism on Large Intestine and Nervous system.

    Small Intestines: Salmonella? On the left hand, this is possible, on the
    right hand it is very unusual. Right hand is more likely Duodenitis or
    Ulcus Duodeni.

    Circulation: Calcoheel. That would not be good. All kind of remedies could
    fit here but not Calcoheel.
    Barijodeel, Aurumheel, Aesculus, Atropinum are all far more likely. If
    Calcoheel matches, it would indicate that the bloodvessels NEEDED calcium.
    I have never heard of that. For the blue toes, the most likely remedy is
    Syzygium

    I agree that most of the problems are likely to be caused by the
    Gallbladder

    I found Berberis on the Insulin (hypo-right hand) point. 

    It says in the protocol that you can try Gallbladder remedies on this point
    and Berberis is under the Gallbladder remedies. I tried this remedy because
    I had already measured other Gallbladder remedies in past sessions.

    Can the Gallbladder be like the Appendix where you need to run the same
    remedies several times?

    I did find Salmonella on the left hand but it seemed to clear the right
    hand as well. Can this not ever happen? Maybe I need to be extra sure of my
    measuring. 

    On what meridian point would I measure for Calcoheel? If this is a disorder
    of calcium metabolism and the Parathyroid is responsible for this, don't
    most people have this problem to some degree since everyone's Parathyroid
    is dropping in the first few sessions? 

    I will try Syzygium for the purple toes. Are the purple toes a circulation
    problem caused by the Gallbladder and can this take a long time to go away?

    It would be so helpful if part of our training included going over the
    nosodes in the manual to have a better understanding of them. 

    When I read Syzygium I would have never know it could be used for blue
    toes. Maybe you do cover this in future classes that I have not taken yet.

    I will update after her next treatment.

    The Gallbladder remedies you need to test for on the insulin point should
    be nosodes first.

    And yes, you can find the Gallbladder remedies more than one time. Calculi
    Billiaris are Gallstones and it might take a while before the body has
    dissolved them. Until such time they will be measurable.

    It is possible that you measure Salmonella on both hands, however this is
    very uncommon in my experience.

    The Parathyroid does drop one or two sessions but no more. But even the
    second time you need to investigate why the drop is still there, I always
    try the second time remedies like Chronic Tonsillitis, Varicellen,
    Variolinum etc. 
    The second time that a point drops, I never try the remedies that i have
    tried the first time.

    Calcoheel is a remedy for the calcium metabolism, but not as causal as for
    example Anti-Tetanus. I use Calcoheel as support and not as a remedy for
    the Parathyroid. 
    So, if there is osteoporosis, then the cause is the Parathyroid. I solve
    this and then give Calcoheel and Osteoheel as remedies to deal with the
    symptoms that have occurred in the years that the Parathyroid was
    malfunctioning.

    Some times you can measure Calcoheel on the Cartilage and Articular
    Degeneration meridian or sometimes on the Connective or Fatty Tissue
    meridian.

    The circulation problem could be caused by the Gallbladder, but can also be
    atherosclerosis. 
    In this case the body needs to remove the calcium first out of the blood
    vessels. This can be aided by remedies like Barijodeel and Aurumheel. The
    body has the system that it dumps any "dirt" as far away from the vital
    organs as is possible. The hands and feet are the first options.

    My Client's stomach issues are getting better. Her reflux and heartburn
    have been gone for a couple of weeks. Her biggest complaint is the swelling
    in her toe ( left foot second toe closest to the baby toe) after each
    treatment. She did have one week where she was not treated and her toe
    randomly swelled up. I asked her if she did a cardio workout that day and
    she had. Overall she has cut back on her exercise. Her blue feet are not
    quite as blue but still have a ways to go. Another problem that I haven't
    resolved is her Asthma. 

    Last treatment:

    >12 yrs Program: 
    Triple Warmer (L- Adrenal) - Selenium 
    Small Intestine (L) - Brucella Abortus Bang 
    Circulation and Arteries (L) - Barijodeel 
    Large Instestine (L) Appendicitis Necroticans 
    Lungs (R) - Staphylococcus and Chlamedia Pneumonia 
    Lymphatic System (Tonsils) - Chronic Tonsillitis, Tonsillitis and Tonsillar
    Compositum
    Large Instestine (R - Appendix) - Appendicitis Necroticans 
   
    Footplates: 
    Small Intestine (L) Campylobacter Pylori 
    Supports: Berberis, Hepar, Solidago, Anginheel, Atropinum, Syzygium,
    Aurmheel, Apis and Arnica. 
   
    She did not have any points dropping on her feet today. 

    Question: This was her 9th treatment and I have treated her Kidney's,
    Gallbladder and Liver many times. I have also treated Tonsils and Appendix
    multiple times. I think because I am a new practioner I have not figured
    out the why to keep the infections gone. Maybe I have missed some food
    poisonings that have been the why? I am hoping that the Campylobacter
    Pylori could have been a why? Any help to figure out the swelling in the
    toe and the Astma would be great?

    The swelling on the toe is definitely caused by a Circulation issue, but
    because the swelling is sometimes increasing and sometimes subsiding, the
    circulatory problem is likely caused by the Gallbladder system, affected by
    sudden Stress or sudden Relaxation.

    You say you have treated Liver many times but the other issues have not
    been resolved yet. 

    Also it is strange that you still measure the Adrenals. They might be
    dropping a few times but not 9 times. This could indicate that something
    else is afoot. Perhaps the client is still spending more energy than she
    has or that something else is puling them down.

    The fact that you still measure Appendicitis Necroticans after 9 treatments
    means that the Appendix is dead and cannot be healed. That is, if you
    treated it all 9 sessions.

    Or you can try Tuberculinum and Tuberculinum Bovinum, This is also a
    possibility.
    And try Schwefheel and Psorinum for Therapy Resistance.

    Her Asthma might also be caused by the Adrenal Exhaustion. Does she use
    inhalers? They contain Cortisone and in that case every three treatments
    count as one. So if she does, you really have done only three treatments.
    Cortisone production is done by the Adrenal Cortex. For healing of this you
    need Berberis and not selenium.

    I saw my client today and last week was the first time her toe did not
    swell after a treatment. The color in her toes was much better. I have
    treated her Appendix 5 times, Liver 3 times and Gallbladder 4 times. Maybe
    I have not addressed the Liver enough? 

    Today when she arrived she was feeling worse. These symptoms started 2 days
    ago. Her reflux and heartburn were back. Those issues had been gone for 3
    weeks. I measured Leptospirose Canicola. Three days ago she had been
    cleaning up dog poop in her yard. Could this be one way to be exposed to
    this? 

    Small Intestine (L) - Leptospirose Canicola 
    Heart (L) and Lungs (L) - Scarlatinum
    Adrenals - Berberis 
    Lungs (R) - Scarlatinum 
    Large Instestine (R) - seem to have cleared with the other nosodes. 
    (Looking at the protocol I should have mabe taken out the Food Poisoning
    and tried Diverticulosis. Her Appendix point was not dropping today) 
    Circulation - Aescules 
    Small Intestine (R) - Duodenitis 
    Gallbladder - Biliary Cirrhosis, Calculi Billiaris 
    Kidneys - Cystopyelonephritis and Calculi Renales 
    Stomach - Gastritis 
    Liver - it was showing but cleared with other nosodes. I did measure
    Schwefheel and Psorinum but they were not a match. 
   
    She is taking Symbicort - 2 puffs every morning, a steriod inhaler. She
    said when she does not take it she coughs through out the night. Albuterol
    ( a bronchodiltator) as needed through out the day. I explained to her that
    every 3 treatments count as one. 
   
    She is interested in trying to go off of the Symbicort and try getting
    through the day with only the Albuterol. 
   
    Question: Is this ok or should I contine to work with her while she is on
    this medication? Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Sally

    You must treat while she is on medication. 
    With this kind of medication it will take longer, but you need to take the
    symptoms away before asking her to leave the medication alone.

    As for the rest: In view of the symptoms I would use more support remedies
    for the Gallbladder, Small Intestine and Stomach (after the Nosodes!)

    I am sorry. I did forget to post the supports I used. 

    I have been supporting her Stomach, Gallbladder, Circulation, Kidneys and
    Liver. I will advise her to wait to go off the medications until her
    symptoms are gone. 

    The good news is her toe is no longer swelling and after treating Food
    Poisonings her Stomach calmed down again.

    Measurements: 
    Circulation (left several drops) 
    Veins( left- several drops) 
    large Intestine (left - 2 points) 
    Lymphatic (left - 2 points) 
    Small Intestine (right - 2 points) 
    Stomach ( L- 1 point) 
    Liver ( right and left - several points ) 
    Gallbladder ( right- 2 points) 

    Standard Treatment: 
    Zirrhose Hepatis, Injeel-Chol, Amoxicillin, Gastritis, Duodenitis,
    Barijodeel, Veratrum, Gastricumheel. 

    Footplates: 
    Ceanothus, Mormordica, Syzygium, Mucosa, Mellilotus, Galium and Placenta. 

    This client has had 17 treatments. You said earlier every 3 treatments
    could count as one because of the Steriod inhalers she is using. She is
    feeling a lot better and the reflux and Heart burn is getting better. Her
    symptoms will be gone for several days and then she I will have a relapse
    for a day. If I run supports on her when she has a set back she immediately
    gets relief. Her large intestine and lymphatic system cleared with my
    nosodes from above but looking back at this maybe I missed an opportunity
    to run either tonsillitis or appendicitis again. I have treated both
    multiple times. She has been sick for 20 yrs so I am assuming this will
    just take time. 

    Questions: 
    1. How long can it take to clear Stomach / Small Intestine Ulcers? 
    Her Circulation has improved but still has a way to go. She still measures
    for multiple Circulation Supports. 
    2. If she measures for Mellilotus, does that mean she has diabetes? 
    3. Is she a good candidate for the Chickey to run circulation supports
    daily in between her treatments? 
    4. Can I also add supports for her Ulcers to run daily? 
    I have been seeing her every 5 days. I want to make sure I don't overload
    the body with too much information. 
    5. Is it ok to know run the good bacteria on every treatment on the
    footplates? I seem to run out of room because of all the Circulation and
    Stomach/Small Intestine supports. 
    6. I am also not sure how many times the Good Bacteria needs to be run? I
    appreciate all your help. Sally

    1. If the Cause has gone, it might need 3 or 4 treatments. If there's a
    continuous cause then of course it takes much longer / forever....

    2. No, it has nothing to do with the Blood Sugars or Insulin

    3. To run supports on a daily basis is too much. You can run a short
    treatment every 3 days

    4. See point 3

    5. You are running too many supports....

    6. There is generally no need to run Bacteria more than 2 times, when the
    body is in a condition to accept them (Appendicitis gone...)

January 2013 edited January 2014 in About This Forum Flag
Instructions on how the forum should be used can be found on the following
page.

http://www.biontology.com/forum/use-of-the-forum/

These guidelines might read as a lot/difficult, but in essence it is just
following your regular treatment:

1 interview 
2 measurement / assessment
3 remedies / treatment
4 results
5 questions

When you present a case in this way it is easiest for other practitioners to
follow what you did and everybody can think with you.

    You can also look at some other cases to get an impression. I've worked on
    almost every case to make it more readable. Some things that help:

    *Don't use abbreviations! Especially many in a row... this is not pleasant
    to read and takes more effort especially for practitioners for whom English
    is not their first language or for new student that don't know all the
    remedies and therapy programs yet.

    *Use clear space... empty lines between subjects allows a better overview
    on all steps taken.

    *Sort different information in sections that are useful.... like Client,
    Symptoms,  Medical Diagnoses, Measurement, Treatment, Questions, etc. and
    then try to fit all the information of your case in these boxes. Don't
    spread the information all through one long text so everybody has to search
    for it.

    *Use capitals for important words like the different organs, remedies,
    diseases, treatments... This pulls the attention towards these words and
    makes it again easier to read.

    *Don't use all kinds of colors and fonts. This makes things chaotic. If
    you've created a text in Word or outside the forum and you want to copy
    paste it. Use the button with the note with the letter T on it. A window
    will open where you can paste your content and submit it. The text has no
    formatting anymore afterward so you have to work on it a little bit. Better
    is just to write the text on the forum.

Fluid Retention?

Are there remedies for treating Fluid Retention (edema)?

    Hi Dan,

    You're not going to solve any issue with a recipe or just a couple of
    remedies, the only thing this might do is give some symptom relief. 

    To get a successful treatment you have to take into account the whole
    situation of your client. So please follow the instructions of posting a
    case and describe your client, your measurements, the remedies you found,
    what the result was etc. Only then we have insight in your client and
    you'll get a useful answer.
   
    Here you can find how to present a case.

    Thank you

    Karolina is on the point. 
    Recipes will probably just resolve symptoms. There are so many factors that
    have to be taken into consideration. 
    If you think of basics in anatomy you can go over the first things.
    Kidneys, Bladder, Lymphatic System, Large Intestines and the the Pituitary
    is all part of it. 
    I have also seen blood pressure medicine giving this side-effect. If this
    is the case, focus on getting the blood pressure to normal so the medicine
    can be reduced. 
    The protocol is solid and should always be followed first. 

     Regards
    Halli

    Thank you Halli,

    There are so many causes of edema:

    Water Retention (Kidneys, Adrenals)
    High Blood Pressure (Liver/Gallbladder)
    Weakness of Veins (Calcification/weakness of Valves, Inflammation, Allergy)
    Congestion (Liver Cirrhosis, Lung Disease)
    Heart Insufficiency
    Injury
    Protein deficiency
    Lymphedema (Lymphatic obstruction/insufficiency)

    And probably more.... so it is important to know: 
    what is the location of the edema, what does it look like, what are other
    symptoms experienced by this client, when did it start, and most
    important... what did you measure.

    Hi All, this is for all dutch practitioners, 
   
    To be insured in the Netherlands you need to be member of a dutch
    "beroepsvereniging".
   
    "Beroepsvereniging" that accepts Biontologists: BATC

    Requirements of BATC: dutch diploma "Medische basiskennis" + Biontology
    training + annual fee
   
    Insurance through BATC: beroepsaansprakelijkheidsverzekering 


    Study requirements for BATC
   
    * Its important to realize that you have to do the full course of Johan to
    apply for membership of BATC. 
    There are a lot of rules en study hours yo have to have, otherwise you have
    to do some more studies. 

    * You have to earn points every year, so it can be intervision with Johan,
    study books or extra studies to be part of the BATC every year. 

    It is a lot of work but you are insured and you can give your clients the
    opportunity to come to you because if you are part of the BATC they can
    claim money in return and the sessions are cheaper. 
    You can reach a lot more clients and the ones who are very sick and can not
    pay the sessions too.

    Hope this helps,

May 2015 - EMF Sensitivity Contraindication?

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
May 2015 edited May 2015 in Q&A Flag
Questions
I get a lot of EMF sensitive clients. My experience is that most benefit from
biophoton therapy but 2 could not tolerate therapy.

Case 1
One is a 70 years old woman. I measured all Spin Inversion points dropping, and
tried to run the Spin Inversion program on 3 different occasions 1 week apart.
She always developed severe back pain immediately. So we stopped trying. She
had a severe car accident in her 20's, she has large metal fillings- no
amalgam- mostly gold and I suspect some mercury toxicity from earlier amalgam
removal done 'carelessly'.

Answer
This is very limited information. It is important to ask yourself questions as
to why this happened. And then, IF you EXCLUDED possibilities in this process
it is important for me, or anyone else who wants to help you, to know this.
I wonder, for example, if you have done Whiplash and Scar treatment prior to
running the Spin Inversion program. Giving light treatment may cause pain in an
area that is energetically blocked because the light wants to go through but
stagnates. Local treatment may have helped.
You also don’t mention what kind of back pain this person developed. Was it in
between the shoulder blades, or maybe the lower or middle of the back?
Depending on the location there can be different causes that need to be
treated. There maybe a burden on the Kidneys, the Intestines may be involved or
the Gallbladder system is affected… You cannot send someone home after just
running a Spin Inversion treatment, especially if acute symptoms appear, you
need to treat/support those systems that show themselves. And if it is the
Kidneys that are causing this pain, it is even critical to do so.
Another thing I wonder about is if she was hydrated well enough.

Case 2
The other client called from the East coast. He became severely EMF sensitive
after an MRI many years ago. He had received 4 Spin Inversion sessions at
1-week intervals. He got worse for 3 days after the first time, 2 days the 2nd
time and 1 day the 3rd time and after the 4th time he became very ill with
worsening of EMF symptoms including severe light sensitivity lasting for weeks.
He was told this might be due to 'metals'.
I have a lot of tips in general i.e. avoiding EMF and increasing resilience to
EMF BUT this man thinks the Chiren can quickly make him better since treatment
quickly made him worse. Any suggestions or explanation appreciated. This man
also had amalgams removed 'carelessly' i.e. not using the IAOMT protocoll.
(IAOMT = International Association of Oral Medicine and Toxicology)
Is there any advice we can give him for how to improve now?

Answer
It seems this man did not even receive one complete sessions. EMF sensitivity
will not disappear by running a Spin Inversions treatment. You need to measure
and treat according to protocol, and that means giving a complete session.
What probably happened is that suppression was lifted due to the Spin Inversion
treatment, but then nothing was done to address all of the underlying problems.
He needs to be treated by someone very skilled, who will treat according to the
protocol and pay attention to the right organ system at the right time. It is
extremely important to not use Heavy Metals too early on in treatment,
especially in this case, because you suspect that your client is overburdened
by them. You need to focus on healing the Hormone System and exit channels
first.

Question
Do some clients need to use other detoxification methods before they can
tolerate/benefit from biophoton therapy?

Answer 
Biontology can be the most gentle detoxification therapy possible if you treat
according to protocol, so the answer is definitely no. Detoxification protocols
with herbs/drugs/diet/sauna etc. are often violent toward the body because they
do not monitor the Kidneys and the overall reaction of the body. These systems
only focus on pushing things out. I have seen the Chiren and Chikey being
abused to create similar type of treatments, focused on pushing Heavy Metals
out regardless of the condition of the body, but as long as you practice
BIONTOLOGY, which means following the right order of treatment and most
importantly MEASURING, biophoton treatment is the most gentle and effective way
of detoxification.

    A question was posted under the original question before the Q&A by Maggie.

    Question Maggie
    I also had family members who received just Spin Inversion and Whiplash (on
    one or two occasions) and they told me that their neck got stiff or they
    felt minor pain. I didn't treat them since I wasn't ready to do full
    treatment. Is there any reason for this discomfort?

    Answer
    This is a different issue. Sometimes there can be temporary symptoms on the
    location site of a treatment when the body starts healing. But when these
    symptoms don’t improve within 2 or 3 days it is not a healing reaction but
    something that surfaced due to lifting of suppression. In a normal
    Biontology session you would never just treat a Whiplash, so you would
    already start with treating the underlying issues right away.

Glomus Caroticum

    As far as I know the glomus caroticum (carotid body) is a natural part of
    the body, it is a receptor "body" that monitors oxygen levels in the
    blood....

    So I think some information is missing in the question. Is there something
    wrong with the glomus caroticum of your client?

    He is considering Biophoton treatment for artritis symptoms.
    He also has this big glomus caroticum in his neck and we weren't sure if
    during treatment, when his body possible is getting rid of it, it causes
    any danger.
    So far it does not causing a problem but just to be sure
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    Everyone has a glomus caroticum, so the body will never get rid of it. 
     But I think something else may be going on, because otherwise you or your
    client would not be afraid of rejection... is there maybe something
    transplanted in the glomus caroticum?

    Or, if you say he has a "big" glomus caroticum, I suspect he has a glomus
    caroticum tumor? 
    In this case I would not worry as tumors typically "dissolve" instead of
    detach when the body resolves the issue.

    I hope this answers the question.

Dear members,

You have probably noticed a decline in forum-activity of both Johan and me. The
reason is that there are some tasks that we have postponed for some time now,
which demand our full attention and focus. Since it is also summer season and
most people will take holidays we have decided to close the forum for a month. 

Love,

Acid/Alkaline

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
October 2014 edited October 2014 in Q&A Flag
Question:
There is always the belief that pathogens thrive in an acid environment and
alkaline is the healthy state of the body. I know the dietary considerations
but how exactly is acid/alkaline translated in the Chiren, for instance knowing
it is properly balanced or a direct influencing of drops.

Answer by Johan:
I do not see the relevance of this. The stomach needs to be acidic, the
intestines need to be alkaline, the body will not vary blood pH much unless
there is severe illness, urine needs to be acidic. A body with perfect
regulatory capacities will regulate pH very well to the level it needs to be,
in every location of the body. If you eat alkaline, the body starts producing
acid in order to get a balance. If you eat acid, the body produces alkaline.
But when, for example, pancreatic juices or bile are failing to neutralize
gastric juices this poses a problem, because then the intestinal climate
becomes acidic. In this example, the functional problems of Gallbladder and
Pancreas should be your focus of treatment.

The pH is determined by the workings of the digestive system. The whole body
belongs to this system, physical, mental and emotional. Stress for example
cause the whole body to become more acidic. Everything needs to be digested.
Not only food needs to be transformed but also information.

Another thing that makes me doubt the acid/alkaline diet theory is that the pH
is very different when measured in the body than when it is measured outside of
the body. It changes completely when it comes outside the body. This means that
it is extremely difficult to make any assessment on how food will affect the
body’s pH. I personally believe imbalance in pH is mainly a regulatory problem.

    I believe this as well, as I treated a woman who was being treated for too
    much acid by a medical doctor. 

    I measured each time and treated strictly by protocol with a secondary
    thought to measuring for too much or too little acid during my sessions. I
    found she had too little acid in my measurements. 

    After two biophoton treatments, she had gone off her acid reflux and ulcer
    medications and began eating acid foods, which the medical doctor had
    totally restricted. 

    Once her body started healing, everything balanced and began working the
    way it was supposed to. I continued to see her until all points were
    balanced at which time she returned for her follow-up appointment to the
    doctor and he was puzzled at her test results and how everything he was
    treating her for was gone.

    I read a book called Alkalize or Die in the late 90s when it was a new idea
    and it seemed to make sense, but I was puzzled that no one had come up with
    the idea before. I recently had a friend who told me he felt very acidic
    after doing a lot of other therapy. He said his body felt greasy, he
    itched, and was irritable, his urine was strong smelling.It seemed to me
    that he was having problems detoxing. As he was doing other therapy I
    decided to give him a footplate treatment with supports to help him detox.
    Cutis Comp, Berberis, Nux Vomica, Lymphomysot, Solidago, Ubichinon and
    Coenzyme, and one other. I also told him to drink lots. The next day he
    told me he had never felt better..... and the acid feeing had gone. 

    I think his "acid feeling" was just about his detoxification pathways were
    overwhelmed.

    That was my point, not that the digestion acid necessarily is the same as
    an acidic terrain, but that the Chiren has many balancing effects on the
    body. It doesn't have as much to do with what people eat as it does to how
    the body functions and how their metabolism works.

Pain Under Shoulder Blade

MoniqueWandersMoniqueWanders
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Symptoms Flag
Cliënt:
Man, who I did not treat yet. 

History:
Accident about 2 years ago => Neck and schoulder damage

Current Symptoms:
Pain centered in between his shoulder blades => according the hospital he will
have to live with it

Other Therapies:
Physiotherapy => neck has been succesfully treated 

Possible treatment approach:
Of course Whiplash and if measured Spin Inversion, and then work on meridians
that run over the painful area.

Questions:
1. Can this be fixed?
2. Which meridian involves the shoulder blade? (I think Small Intestine,
Bladder, and maybe also the Hormone System?)

    Did the doctors indicate what might be causing the pain? Were there any
    bones broken or other structural issues?
   
    Answers:
    1. I believe it can be fixed. 
    * Firstly you also need to do a Whiplash treatment on the location of the
    pain. 
    * A regular Whiplash treatment needs to be done anyway, and might also help
    for the pain under his shoulder blade.
    2. I think the Large Intestine is more likely than the Small Intestine
    meridian, which runs more on top of the shoulder blade. The Large Intestine
    runs over it. But only the Bladder meridian and the Central meridian run in
    the center between the shoulder blades.

    Thank you for editing my post. I'll pay more attention to it.

    There were no bones broken and there was no indication at all, not even by
    MRI-scan. 
    There was pain and what he calls it 'whiplash looking complaints' which
    have been treated by physio therapy and physio training.

    About the remaining pain spot: it is exactly in the middle of the left
    scapula, which made me wonder about the importance of the Small Intestine
    meridian. Does this make a difference?

    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    March 2015 Flag
    The Small Intestine meridian does not reach the center of the shoulder
    blade, but the Large Intestine meridian does. 

    If there is no structural reason for the pain the solution might be as
    simple as a (local) Whiplash treatment.

Measurement - Effects of Hearing Aids

Chrystyne
October 2014 edited October 2014 in Measurement Flag
Client:
Woman who came in for her bi-monthly checkup. She was wearing new Hearing Aids.
 

Measurement:
2 month ago => no drops
Checkup => drops on ears and tonsils, but she did not experience any discomfort
=> when Hearing Aids were removed the drops disappeared

Question:
Should Hearing Aids be removed when measuring?

Comments

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    October 2014 edited October 2014 Flag
    This is not a measurement problem. It is an indication that there is an
    energetic disturbance caused by the hearing aid. This will in time lead to
    physical problems.

    When you take the hearing aid (or other things like rings, glasses etc.)
    off before measurement, you miss out on information and the ability to
    assist the body with the possible disturbances caused by them. 

    It would only make sense for you to take the hearing aids off before
    measurement if she would never use the them ever again, but the reality is
    that they are going to be a continuous source of exposure to an
    electromagnetic field. The only thing you can do is to try help her get
    stronger to be able to handle this electromagnetic source better.

    What you can do in this situation (which is never going to be optimal):
    1. Measure with the hearing aids in her ears
    2. Find the remedies needed to balance the points
    3. When the drops persist, you can ask the client to remove the hearing
    aids and see then what the points do. 
    4. If the hearing aids are indeed the cause of the drops, you can make a
    remedy of the hearing aid, then treat with it and after this see if the
    hearing aid still causes a problem…

    There is no guarantee that it is going to work. 
    To environmental factors like this, there may be no other solution than to
    get rid of them. But this of course is not a choice anyone would make if
    then this would result in not hearing anything… 

    I do not know much about differences between hearing aids. Maybe there is a
    better alternative than the ones she is using right now...

    Hello Chrystyne, 

    We had this happen to a friend of ours. She had this high pitch sound
    always with the hearing aids on, but since she has had hearing damage since
    very young, she had just accepted this.  For years suffered from intestinal
    issues, poor bowel movements.. 
    However, once she had her gold crowns removed, and mercury fillings and
    root canals removed, within only 12 hours she had a normal bowel movement
    after 20 years being irregular.. also the electrical effect of the hearing
    aids changed- no more high pitch sound and her measurements changed. All of
    this was so much affected by the metal in the mouth. 
    Those crowns were on the intestinal meridians.. and after so many years..
    she got relief simply by removing them.. and then it was so much easier
    measuring her points.
    One of my first questions to my clients is always asking what's in their
    mouth. And if they say there is a crown, I have them find out if there is
    mercury below these crowns.. You can see this in their x-rays. Then note
    the meridian of those teeth.
   
    So many dentists in the past have the practice of leaving the metal
    (mercury) in the tooth and simply placing a crown over the filling causing
    a "bi-metal" galvanic current running in the mouth 24 / 7.  Getting these
    metals removed, changes so much in the measurements with the Chiren as well
    as the health of the individual. This has been my experience.

    Would it help to put the hearing aids between the 2 footplates and run the
    standard 2-7 years program to neutralise their negative information?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    December 2014 Flag
    Hearing Aids cause electromagnetic radiation, this radiation can create a
    resonance with any metal in the mouth, whether it is gold or mercury or
    aluminium. (Just metals amongst each other can do this too) 

    Metals parts in the body (e.g. dental fillings and titanium pins/plates)
    cannot be neutralised. These parts are building up their potential all the
    time as long as they are there. This is the real culprit and the ability
    for metal to build potential will not be changed by putting the aids in
    between the footplates.

    There is a difference in hearing aids. The fact that a chip in the aid is
    changed in a different model will also change the effect on the body or on
    a filling or crown.

    Beware to also check the jaw points on the Stomach meridian and Tonsil
    points to assess the effect of the hearing aids.

Therapy Resistance - Lyme

    I agree that there is too little information. Also what you did mention
    seems to be a bit strange. Taken out of context of the complete assessment
    and treatment according to protocol (you did not provide this information)
    there seems to be no focus or result. The sixth session you are still
    working on the Hormone System and Kidneys…

    Therapy resistance => is when you get all the energetic systems corrected,
    but there is no physical response.

    The fact that she still has a response (although negatively) shows that the
    body in fact IS able to respond to the energetic changes. So therapy
    resistance is not the problem here. I think there is a problem with the
    assessment and treatment sequence.

    I also think there is confusion about Hidden Spin Inversion. This is not
    something that can show up after removing a ring.

    Hidden Spin Inversion => is when you don't measure anything out of the
    ordinary. You still find remedies that match, just as usual. But when you
    then treat with those remedies they don't have any effect. So Hidden Spin
    Inversion can never show up in the initial measurement (that is why it is
    called "hidden").

    All these details about the Biontology basic principles are described in
    the new Biontology manual that was distributed by free download. I would
    suggest to everyone to thoroughly read it, because many questions that
    Johan and I still get will be answered in this manual. Especially the
    protocols need thorough reading. Focus of treatment is extremely important
    and is missing in many of the cases Johan is reviewing now. If there is no
    focus and understanding of the right order of treatment results will be
    limited and usually not permanent.

Cat's Claw in Chiren

    Cat's Claw is not a standard remedy in the Chiren, and the source is
    unknown. What I do know for sure is that it is not a homeopathic remedy
    from the same suppliers that all the other remedies come from. Most likely
    it was made from an undiluted plant extract with limited potential.

    Thank you.

    The cats claw remedy was already loaded in the chiren. It is not something
    I added.

    Can you explain why an extract has limited potential?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    May 2015 edited May 2015 Flag
    The effects of extracts are partly based on the chemical composition of the
    substance. So the energetic action of Cat's Claw in the Chiren will be
    similar but not be exactly the same as the effect it will have when taking
    the extract. 

    The effect of homeopathic remedies, however, is solely based on their
    energetic action and potentiation makes this effect stronger. The quality
    all depends on the procedure/manufacturer though. 

    Also, low potency herbal information in the Chiren is frequently found in
    the Compositae. But then this is a combination of many things and not just
    one extract. The Compositae have a weak supportive action. They will never
    be able to deliver what a nosode does.

Symptoms and Matching Remedies

Maggie LesniewskiMaggie Lesniewski
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Symptoms Flag
Client:
My 6 years old daughter, with Kidney disease.

Medical Diagnosis:
FSGS - Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis => Glomeruli are damaged and don't
filter properly leaking protein in the urine causing edema and numerous other
issues. She had a biopsy done so we know for fact that her kidneys are
damaged. 

Questions:
1. Is it normal that after couple of treatments the Kidneys are not dropping
anymore but they are still causing problems like protein in the urine, edema,
problems with blood etc.?

2. Albumoheel seems like a perfect remedy/support but Solidago seems to work
better and Albumoheel doesn't really make the points straight. I am new to
Biontology so it might be me measuring wrong but another practitioner who has
been treating my daughter had similar results.
I know we should listen to the body and with the use of Chiren it will tell us
what type of remedies it needs but at the same time all these symptoms that
Karolina listed in her wonderful book are there for a reason.

So I am little confused ...

    1. As answered previously -LINK-, the high blood pressure medication might
    be the problem.
    Personally I have always found drops on Kidneys to continue as long as the
    problems persist. 
    As said one has to concentrate on Kidneys and Circulation/Veins

    2. Albumoheel is indeed the correct support remedy. But in these serious
    Kidney cases I put ALL Kidney support remedies in at the same time.
    Perhaps it might be better to try to get the actual homeopathic remedies
    that she can take. Albumoheel and other remedies are still available as far
    as I know. In this way she can take it frequently.

    Now after her 3rd treatment, the Lyme's is making her fingers and wrist and
    jaw swollen.  She also has slight headaches and pain in her joints.  She
    says that this hasn't happened since last February when she started the
    antibiotic treatment.  Is it possible that treatments could be aggravating
    the Lyme's and causing it to flare up? 
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel

    1. You have treated with Staph and Strep. These bacteria normally occur on
    Heart and Lung. Heart and Lung are YIN organs which should only be treated
    after the YANG organs have been cleared. 
    2. It is unlikely that only the Hormone System dropped during the first
    session and only the Heart and Circulation dropped during the second
    session. The first couple of treatments drops usually appear on many
    meridians and if they don't there are endorphins at play.
    3. Like Peter said, there is no need for the 2-7 treatment. The is way too
    much. I advise you to study your new manual closely.
    4. Arthritis is a Kidney problem, and yet the Kidneys don't show up in your
    measurement. This is another indication that you should question your
    measurement and wonder whether the cause may be endorphins or something
    else.
    5. The medical diagnosis does not help us at all, it even does the opposite
    and cause subjectivity in assessment and treatment. What we need to know is
    what symptoms the client experiences. With arthritis I can guess but with
    Lyme everything seems to be possible. Apparently there are 160 symptoms
    associated with Lyme. I have seen many alternative hypes come and go, and
    in all cases the treatment was just the same. 
    6. Antibiotics destroy the Intestinal Flora, which for sure should show up
    on the Intestines (and a lack of intestinal flora in the Intestines often
    goes together of Bacterial Flora infections of the Urogenital tract!).
    Again information that should make you wonder. Integration of information
    and measurements is essential in Biontology.
    7. Flaring up of inflammation, whether it really is Lyme related or not,
    can happen when suppression is lifted by biophoton treatment. But when you
    treat in the right sequence with the right support, huge flare ups are
    usually not necessary. 
    8. You did not focus on the Kidneys at all, while in arthritis this is
    specifically what you need to do.. When weak Kidneys get another hit
    because of detoxification caused by the biophoton treatment, this of course
    aggravates their problem.
    9. Often clients who come in with Lyme diagnoses have jaw infections. The
    fact that you measured drops on the Stomach meridian and after this her jaw

Electro Hypersensitivity and Biophoton Coherency

TorilJelterTorilJelter
April 2015 edited April 2015 in Q&A Flag
Client request:
To be helped for EHS (electro-hypersensitivity)

My experience:
After 8 sessions they feel much better in most settings and I measure no drops
on 2 occasions 1 week apart. 
I then measure them after 4 hours of exposure in an office setting - 70% of
their measurements are drops. 

I'm guessing Johan might say I didn't find the root cause... 

Questions:
1. How do you find the root cause when clients no longer have drops? 
2. It seems to me some of the drops we measure in indoor settings are actually
a reflection of room exposures. I often measure outdoors and I'm wondering if I
need to add a measurement when I think they are 'done' with their biophoton
session series in their home/office/school setting after 4 hours of exposure to
see if they are strong enough to 'withstand' these environments.
3. Any other advice?

    I have some questions:
    * The last two sessions, were there no drops in the first measurement, or
    were there drops initially that disappeared after the treatment but
    reappeared 4 hours later?
    * What symptoms still persist?

    My experience is that there are always (be it slight) drops to work with. I
    haven't had a client with no drops at all the beginning of a treatment,
    unless it was a case of an endorphin mask...

    No drops at all for 2 sessions seems suspicious... Perhaps this time the
    pressure with the probe was too high for this client?

    If the drops occurred after 4 hours in an office setting, it would seem an
    environmental issue.  
    Unless you mean 'in your office'  -  Is there Spin Inversion?

    1st to 8th Session
    Many drops that became gradually less 

    9th and 10th Session
    No drops at the beginning of the session

    The client was not in Electron Spin Inversion.

    All sessions were done in a low EMR environment. Then I tested after 4
    hours in my office (wifi etc.) and found 70% of points dropping. 
   
    My thinking
    It is probably environmental. 
    I suspect EMR in my medical clinic/ office setting. 
    This problem is mostly unique to my practice maybe as I usually do
    measurements in a very low EMR environment. 

    Questions
    1. I wonder how often we are measuring environmental exposures. 
    2. Do I need to check my clients in a high EMR environment to see if they
    are strong enough to withstand daily exposures at home/work/school. 
    3. When drops can vary according to environment it makes it difficult to
    understand when the biophoton series is done. How do I know?

    I'm trying to understand this situation but you give so little information,
    and your focus seems to be solely on the EMR/environment...

    I would assume that EMR is more likely to affect a weaker system, not a
    system that is completely balanced and healthy. This is what would make me
    doubt the absence of drops. My experience is that as long as there are
    symptoms there are drops that reflect them, unless endorphins are masking
    those drops.

    It also makes me wonder how this man could be unaffected by EMR all week in
    between the 9th and 10th session and then all of a sudden reacts so
    abruptly on the environment in your office. 

    My understanding of Biontology is that the most important indication of
    "being done" is that the discomfort/symptoms are completely gone, and not
    the complete absence of drops. 

    I find it hard to understand the total absence of drops, because the world
    we live in is extremely unclean, and there seems to always be something
    that shows up. Toxins, food poisoning... When a body is so sensitive to EMR
    that it reacts heavily to it within 4 hours after treatment, then it will
    be sensitive to these other factors too.
    I would suggest investigating the lack of drops.... 

    So my further questions to you are:
    * Did you try correcting an endorphin mask? 
    * Are the symptoms completely gone, or are there still (some of the)
    complaints that the client came in with
    * What kind of treatment did you give if he had no drops to work with?

    I wonder if there was an endorphin mask first and then the environmental
    disturbance causes steep energetic drops? In the meantime, the physical
    drops might be hidden underneath this?

    Answers to your questions above:
    Client feels much better, can now tolerate much more than before, but high
    EMF areas remain a problem
    Client lives in a lower EMR area

    Questions for Kat:
    Do you mean you never get all points balanced? In my experience I do.
    Eventually symptoms are significantly improved and assessment shows no
    drops. Are you saying you always consider this unreliable information?

    Further explanation of my question:
    I get alot of EMF sensitive clients. 
    If I measure them in a low EMR environment I think I also need to measure
    them in a high EMR environment after 4 hours to check their resilience
    before we agree that the biophoton series is complete OR perhaps I need to
    accept these drops in certain environments as a form of self preservation..
    Perhaps it is a good thing that 70% of their biophotons drop with exposure.
    They develop symptoms and their body says this is an unhealthy environment
    "get out of here".

    If I am understanding you correctly you are saying I am not done with the
    client because they get many drops with a certain environmental exposure
    BUT my point is that some reactions/ drops/ symptoms are part of our
    organisms ability to survive & enjoy life. Symptoms can be our guide to
    enjoyment and self preservation.

    I made this observation and I wanted to share it because I thought it was
    interesting. Then I was trying to figure out if there are clinical
    implications of this observation and soliciting feedback on my thought
    process.

    I have also done  Electron Spin Inversion measurements of people with their
    smartphone on their lap-so far most go into Electron Spin Inversion except
    for one man. I find this interesting but I'm not sure of the clinical
    implications because when people use their phone it is against their head
    BUT often it is in their pocket- near their thigh. If they go into Spin
    Inversion each time then of course ability to self heal is impaired. Has
    anyone else done this experiment?
    (Note from Karolina: This is not Spin Inversion that was measured. One does
    not get in and out of Spin Inversion because of exposure and non-exposure
    to cellphones. What the cellphone does and what Toril measured in this case
    is that it disrupts the aura, which also causes steep drops)

    In the manual it says if a person is in Electron Spin Inversion repeatedly
    they need to identify the source to benefit from further biophoton therapy.
    This is what I am trying to help my clients figure out. What is the source
    of spin SO then they may benefit from biophoton therapy.

    Questions to Toril:
    * Have checked your office for the obvious, metals, Hartman lines, etc?  
    * If so, then what could be so high in your office that creates these
    drops?  WiFi?  Go direct with the internet, if possible.  
   
    I tend to agree with Kat, that endorphins may be an issue.

    To my understanding, there is a difference between the effect of an
    (electro) magnetic field and that of EMF from cellphone radiation though.
    The first can lead to Spin Inversion and the other one will cause steep
    drops because of aura weakness that will react to Montmorillonite or
    Ozaliet.

    If there is continued Spin Inversion finding the cause is the most
    important thing to do. Common causes are alarm clock near the bed, metal in
    the bed or mattress etc.

    I look mostly at the results when deciding if a client is "done". When the
    tumor, discomfort, migraine, lack of certain abilities, etc. are all gone,
    the client is done. This does not necessarily mean that all drops are gone.
    Even the "balanced" people amongst us will have some drops measured.

    Johan's supernova story illustrates that if all points are perfectly
    balanced that this is not a normal sign of health. Health is a process.
   
    But since you did not stop treating your client even though there were no
    drops, I think we do agree that the treatment is only finished when all
    symptoms are gone. 
    I am wondering what remedy choices you made without there being drops to
    navigate on. Did you just use the light? Or some support remedies?
   
    The big effects of environment can be very frustrating indeed. Of course I
    encounter this problem with my clients too. When right after a successful
    treatment someone experiences a lot of stress or is exposed to Smart meters
    or magnetic fields this will mess up much of the positive effect of the
    session.
   
    But those clients who are still very sensitive have this sensitivity all
    the time, and this shows in the initial measurement with many drops. At one
    point they of course become stronger and this will show in the
    measurements. 

    Only when I measure too soon after a previous treatment  (or in case of
    endorphin mask) I encounter the situation that there are still physical
    problems but no drops.

    As for EMF sensitivity. I think it is a combination of exposure and overall
    strength. 
    I can feel the effect of fields too, but most of them can be handled OK by
    a healthy body. But in a state of exhaustion or illness the body becomes
    more sensitive. On the other hand, if a healthy body is exposed to a strong
    a field over a longer period this can also weaken the body until the point
    it cannot handle this anymore, but that will take time. 
   
    I guess the question that came up for me is whether the client became ill
    due to environment, or client was ill, then became more sensitive to
    environment. If this client lives in an unhealthy location/situation, then
    maybe moving is the only answer if you cannot clean up that area... But if
    it is the second answer, the treatments should be able to make him less and
    less sensitive, just like with allergies. And you state that they are still
    improving so I suspect this is the situation.

    My understanding of Spin Inversion:
    It is caused by EMFs. 
    The difference is in 'energy sensitive' persons where other energetic
    forces can disturb the person. 
   
    Personal experience with Wifi:
    I was working in New York City before and after the introduction of WiFi. 
    I had a number of patients who perceived the WiFi as a very irritating
    neurological disturbance making them nervous, itchy, hyperactive and, over
    all, annoyed. When they moved out of New York City to the country their
    symptoms resolved for the most part. 
   
    So I think there are more factors here, and it may be possible that WiFi
    type microwave energy can be a cause of Spin Inversion in some but not all
    people, as well as other energy waves we are unaware of. 
    (Note from Karolina: this is not true, Spin Inversion is never caused by
    Wifi or other energy waves)

    Personal experience with Electrosensitivity
    I am still searching for a way to tolerate WiFi, wireless devices,
    Bluetooth, and, of course, cellphones for any appreciable length of time. I
    do not believe I am always in Spin Inversion though I am always sensitive
    to radio frequency radiation.

    My understanding of Spin Inversion
    As explained to me in class and by practitioners, Spin Inversion is due to
    magnetic field exposure, not Electro Magnetic Radiation. 
   
    Research on EMR exposure
    Recent studies are suggesting links between EMR exposure and blood brain
    barrier, DNA, and neurological damage, as well as reduction in sperm count
    and blood motility. Children, pregnant women, and those with preexisting
    conditions are especially vulnerable and some organizations, including the
    American Pediatric Association, California Medical Association, and
    American Association of Environmental Medicine are warning against the
    dangers of EMR.
   
    This is truly a public health issue we have yet to fully understand due to
    the lack of information and funded independent research.  I would expect
    that clients with metal implants are also especially susceptible to this
    type of disease.

    How I understand Spin Inversion:
    Electromagnetic disturbances can make one more sensitive to Spin Inversion,
    but they don't have to actually lead to Spin Inversion. The weaker one gets
    the more sensitive one becomes. 

    When there are steep drops and Spin Inversion treatment and/or Whiplash
    treatment do not have any effect, remedies like Montmorillonite and Ozaliet
    can help remove the energetic disturbance. When you put them in the slots,
    you will notice this directly in your measurement and then you can continue
    to measure for remedies that correct the underlying physical drops.

    Of course I agree with all of you that Wifi, cellphones, microwaves etc.
    affect our overall wellbeing negatively. This is pretty obvious. Everyone
    who gets away from it all and stays in nature for a holiday will notice
    this.
    So it is not so much the fact that someone is sensitive to the environment
    that makes me wonder, but the complete absence of drops followed by all
    these drops 4 hours later. If this client did not suffer any effect of EMF
    disturbances all week, but then 4 hours after treatment he is, this is
    puzzling to me.

    I have seen energetic drops appear under certain circumstances too
    (jewellery, cellphone etc.) but just not on someone without any drops at
    first.
   
   
    Candace:
    I always think of you when it comes to metal implants. They sure create
    their own disturbing field, and I wish there was a way to not have metal
    implants disturb anymore! But I understand that this is impossible since it
    is the metal itself that disturbs.

    More information:
    Client felt the symptoms had been resolved, and the measurement was good so
    I did not treat him the last 2 times.
    The experiment I did was to see how a higher EMR environment would affect
    the client, so I repeated measurements 4 hours later after client had been
    in an office setting and found about 70% drops. This client does have
    multiple small metal stents in the abdomen after surgery.
    I was also very surprised to find all those drops. But perhaps I should see
    the glass half full and say isn't it impressive that they didn't go into
    Spin Inversion. Some people do that in a second or less and maybe others it
    is a gradual process and perhaps eventually this client would have gone
    into Spin Inversion in this office environment.

    Question:
    Is this a client that needs to limit their exposures chronically because of
    the metal stents?

    Question to Toril:
    Did you treat the client under the conditions of your office?  And did he
    react to the treatment?  Of course, if he did not react to the treatment,
    then the protocol calls for Hidden Spin Inversion.  Just a thought...

    Kat:
    I understand your question. I agree with you those with preexisting
    conditions or weaknesses are more likely to get into Spin Inversion. A home
    inspection revealed there is a strong magnetic field in my house that I
    have yet to remediate. 

    Toril:
    I agree that just a day's worth of exposure in an office environment can
    cause overall weakness in a client. It happens to me whenever I take a trip
    to NYC where as Stefano mentions there is very high exposure. Personally, I
    have had to avoid exposure.

    My own experience with EMF sensitivity:
    Just adding in some of my experience, as a sufferer, if it should help. The
    fact I am not in Spin Inversion as much as I used to be is impressive, too.
    The Chiren and Spin Inversion treatments truly have helped me get stronger
    and Biontology has educated me about this environmental disturbance so I
    can better avoid it.
  • 
    katkat
    April 2015 edited April 2015 Flag
    That makes sense! The metal stents can make one more sensitive.

    I think in this case it is best to keep checking him once in a while, since
    this disturbance will continue to cause a weak spot. And I assume that they
    cannot be removed...

    It is good that he lives close to you and responds well to the treatments
    so you can keep him relatively healthy even though the metal may cause the
    sensitivity never to resolve completely.

    More questions:
    * When he was not in that higher EMR environment of your office anymore,
    did the points stop dropping?
    If his points become balanced on their own when he is in cleaner areas, I
    don't think there isn't much to worry about, except for him to mind his
    surroundings...maybe that particular location of the drops is super high? 

    *My last question to fully see this "picture" is: 
    What is the cause of the high EMR in this office space? I agree with
    Stefano and would also try a Spin Inversion Treatment on this client, just
    to cancel out "Hidden Spin"...no harm done in trying...

    Thank you Toril for making all of this more clear for me, and for sharing
    this case. Every single piece of information you added was very relevant to
    understand this case.  
    Hopefully there will be something in the near future that could prevent us
    from being effected by EMR.

    Just to prevent/stop any misconceptions:
    Wifi does NOT lead to Spin Inversion. In order to get into Spin Inversion
    there is a need for a MAGNETIC field, whether it is electro-magnetic,
    earth-magnetic or just plain magnetic. Cellphone radiation is also not
    capable of getting someone into Spin Inversion. What it does do is that it
    weakens the system and thus the aura. This will also cause many steep drops
    to appear.

    Karolina, Have you tried to check for spin inversion when a person has
    their smart phone on and on their thigh?
    It would be interesting to hear what other people find. IF a person has a
    weakened system/ 'aura' from cell phone radiation or something else  they
    may go into spin inversion more easily-is this correct?

    Looking forward to tomorrows Q & A !
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    April 2015 Flag
    Of course I have done this, and it does disrupt the aura in weaker persons.
    But this is not Spin Inversion. The points that indicate Spin Inversion can
    also drop steeply when there is an aura problem.

    Weakening of the system does make one more sensitive to Spin Inversion as
    was discussed earlier. But Spin Inversion does not happen immediately after
    putting a cellphone in the lap, because the cellphone itself is incapable
    of causing Spin Inversion. Aura effects will be instant however.

    You can do the same experiment with crystals as you did with cellphones and
    will find the same outcome. Initially I was confusing Spin Inversion with
    aura problems too, as it was never explained to me properly in class.
  • 
    SVitale
    April 2015 Flag
    So this really is confusing, as displayed by this post.  If WiFi weakens
    the system and causes aura problems AND drops the Spin inversion points,
    there needs to be yet another discriminating analysis as to what is the
    cause.  So the question:  does Spin inversion treatment correct the points
    when aura weakness is actually the problem?  If so then one would have an
    Aura Masking.   It would seem to me then putting Ozaliet as a support would
    be best in this case. 
  • 
    katkat
    April 2015 edited April 2015 Flag
    Yes you can do a 2-7 program with Ozaliet, if the energetic drops remain
    after the first few steps.
    When the longterm aura weakness has lead to going into Spin Inversion, then
    I give the Spin Inversion Treatment. After, it is possible to still
    meassure many energetic drops but not always. Because from my understanding
    any lighttreatment strenghtens the aura.
    If there are still steep drops then question if Whiplash could be the
    cause...and then if nothing corrected the steep drops, I check/treat with
    Ozaliet or Montmorrillonite and try to find out in conversation what could
    have caused this Aura weakness...
    After the steep energetic drops clear and change into physical, we can
    meassure what is needed next.

    With energetic drops:
    Check/treat Scars
    Check/treat Spin Inversion
    Check/treat: Whiplash
    Check/treat: Ozaliet/Montmorillonite

    But before any treatments, if points make a very weak low sound, I ask if
    clients can please wash their hands very good. It happens so often that
    there is some oil/creme left on the skin which totally changes the
    meassurements.
    after washing/drying hands, the meassurements are miraculously easy.

    I also have not received any correspondence from IABS in quite some time. 

    I have tried many times to email (starting back in July & August) as to why
    I was no longer receiving email notifications on Q & A and other
    information. I have never been answered even though I have repeatedly
    emailed my questions.

    I wanted to refrain from posting this on the forum as this is not a forum
    issue, but was going to result to this if I continued to not get answered.
    Now that others have resulted to using the forum as a means of contact I
    too will do so.

    I also have items that were ordered through Diane in June that have not
    been sent and I have been trying to get answers for all these questions. I
    have clients waiting for these items and have to continue to explain to
    them why I have not yet received these items.

    I have received all my IABS information over the last months through a new
    student/friend in my area that has kept me informed of all things, but I
    have not had her forward the updates or the new manual, so I still do not
    have these. She has merely read the information to me and told me when I

    The issue of parts that were ordered is obviously a different matter.
    Possibly things have been too much for the IABS staff to handle, and some
    issues may have been forgotten or not addressed. That is of course no
    excuse, but I hope you can understand the circumstances. It has been a
    roller coaster ride for everyone.

    Johan just told me that only this week we received the backorders for spare
    parts, they will be shipped shortly and arrive next week. 

    However, July seems to be a long time ago, so it may be that something went
    wrong with your order. Can you e-mail me what it is that you have ordered
    and attach your invoice? If you did not receive the invoice something went
    wrong. My e-mail is karolinavanhout@hotmail.com.

    Ronda: I have inquired with Diane and now understand that this complaint is
    not about a normal order, but about the request for a free replacement of
    two Chikey-wires that were broken by a client. She promised to send you
    these (as an exception, because spare parts are not free normally) right
    after you had contact with her in June. 

    From what I have heard, I think that the email address she used in further
    correspondence (ronda@biontologywisconsin.com) doesn't work. This e-mail
    address was the one you provided to the IABS initially on your account
    statement. You never changed it to your new address. I hope the problem is
    solved now and that communication will be better. Diane is fulfilling all

    After creating that email, it was announced that Biontology was a

    Answers:
    1. Yes, phantom pains are caused by scars on the amputated limb. Experience
    has shown that one thorough treatment of the scars is enough to eliminate
    the pain.
    2. Diagnosis is affected, but not the treatment. This makes makes things
    more difficult, you will have to go by your experience in combination with
    the measurements that are still possible (1hand, 2 feet).
    3. It is better to put one rod under the armpit, so you will still have a
    treatment for both hand-meridians and foot-meridians.

    Would it be best to use the glass rods for the scar treatment, or the
    electrical cables with patches?

    I'm not sure if he is interested in any further treatment, but only to
    eliminate the pain - would the scar treatment alone be sufficient, if this
    is the case?

    Electrical cables with patches.

    Usually one treatment is enough for the pain, but you cannot make a promise
    of course. Maybe he is the exception. You never know for sure.

Hidden Spin, Suppression or Treatment Resistance

Jiri
November 2013 edited January 2014 in Spin Inversion & Cause Flag
Problem:
2 clients don't make any progress.

Treatment:
* I treated one for Hidden Spin Inversion even though he showed no drops for
Spin Inversion. 
He has a history of extreme EMF sensitivity. After each of the treatments, his
drops were corrected. And he now states that his EMF sensitivity is about 50%
less than it had been. 

I know that Johan has stated that "if after treatment the same points drop as
before the treatment, then there is a case of hidden spin inversion." 

Questions:
1. Did treating for hidden Spin Inversion help or was it the treating for
Mercury that made the improvement?

2. Please comment on the correct application for Hidden Spin Inversion,
Suppression and Treatment Resistance. What is the correct treatment for each
and what outcome should be expected?

    50% improvement of the EMF sensitivity sounds like considerable progress… 
    So in this case there is no therapy resistance.

    Answers:
    1. Heavy Metals can be the cause of EMF sensitivity, so that might have
    made the difference. 
    But if people are in a Spin Inversion, they also become very sensitive. So
    it could be either.
    In case of EMF sensitivity the problem is that the Aura is affected, and in
    order to keep the Aura up to strength, you need to look at the rest of the
    body. I am sure there must be more symptoms than just his EMF sensitivity

    2. I hope this helps:
    Hidden Spin Inversion: If someone has a Hidden Spin Inversion, it is
    obvious that you do not find any normal Spin Inversion drops. The only
    indication is that the points do not react on treatment, although you did
    find remedies to match. After the Spin Inversion treatment points that did
    not react on normal treatment will react again. If they don't, Spin
    Inversion was not the cause.
    Endorphins masking Spin Inversion: In Spin Inversion the body is always
    under stress, so the readings might be blocked by Endorphins. In this
    situation some drops are not showing, or no drops at all. 
    Lack of improvement: There might be an environmental situation that
    influences progress. One reason might be that the moment the person leaves
    your office and gets home or in his/her car, he/she might get into a Spin
    Inversion again, stopping the results.
    Therapy Resistance: Measurements can either improve or stay the same, but
    there is no improvement of the physical condition. Physical responsiveness
    might improve by treating with Psorinum and Schwefheel.

Sinus Headaches, Dizziness, Anxiety

judyth
June 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
62 year old female, with severe Allergy (according to her own understanding/
believe)

Symptoms:
Sinus Headaches, Clogged Nasal Passages (difficulty breathing),
Dizziness (almost to the point of Vertigo),
Lots of Anxiety / Depression.

Headache => starts in the back of the head (on the Mastoid process(sinuses)
bilaterally and the line that connects them). More severe as the day
progresses. Often additional headache in a ring around her eyes. It can become
so severe she must lay down.
Symptoms => For 20 years. All year round, less severe in winter

Medical Interventions:
Advil (or another over the counter product for the headaches)
No prescription meds.
Acupuncture for the past 4 months.
Bag full of supplements, we talked about overburdening the body with so many to
process, she agreed to stop any with calcium in them.

1st session

1st measure no drops 2-7 years Atropinum, Viscum, plumbum
2nd measure no drops Whiplash / Spin Inversion  still no drops
3rd measure with Cholecystitis in the slot

Thymus (R) - Selenium, Little Flannel Flower
Insulin (R) - Adenomyose Gallenblase, Hepar, Chelidonium
Large Intestine - corrected with remedies above...

4th measurement (with above in the slots)

Sex organs (R) - Anti Tetanus, Poliomyelitis
Small Intestines (R) -  Anti Tetanus, Poliomyelitis
Veins (R) 
Nervous System (R)
Heart (L)

>12 year Program:  
Cholecystitus, Little Flannel Flower, Selenium, Adenomyose Gallenblase, Hepar,
Chelidonium, Anti Tetanus, Poliomyelitis

5th measurement

Tonsil Point (L & R) - Tonsilitis
Bladder (R) - Tonsillitis

Footplate Treatment: 
Tonsillitis, Anginheel, Pertusis, Diphteria, Serum Ovile, Cererum, Viscum,
Thalamus

6th measurement:

Heart (R)
Kidneys no drops so I chose to not treat


2nd Session

Measurement:
Adrenals, Thymus (R) and Insulin (R) - Selenium, Berberis
Kidney (R + L) and Circulation (R + L) - Calculi Renales, Reneel, Calculi
Billiaris
Small Intestines (L) - Salmonella Typhi, Salmonella Paratyphi
Lungs (L) -  balanced by above remedies...

>12 Years Program:
Berberis, Selenium,Calc Renales, Calc Billiares, Reneel, Salmonella Typhi,
Salmonella Paratyphi, Barijodeel

2nd Measurement:
Kidney (L) - Cystopylonephritis
Circulation (R)
Small Intestines (L) - Leptospirose Canicola, Brucellosis
Tonsil Point (R) - Chronic Tonsillitis

Footplates:
Aurumheel, Cystopyelonephritis, Leptospirose Canicola, Brucellosis, Chronic
Tonsilitis, Solidago, Nux Vomica, Anginheel

3rd Measurement: 
No drops

Questions:

1 The 1st sessions there were no drops on Pineal, Pituitary, Parathyroid,
Thyroid. 
Could regular acupuncture sessions during the months before she saw me be
responsible for this?

2 Am I right in assessing the Headache (on the Mastoid Process) to be on the
Gallbladder Meridian? And the Secondary Headache around the eyes on the Stomach
Meridian?
This is not supported by the Headache worsening in the afternoon....

I find it puzzling there are no drops on the Gallbladder meridian on the foot
(only on the Triple Warmer) or the Stomach meridian. She was treated both times
around noon and did not have a headache either time. 
 
3 In the 2nd Session I found Chronic Tonsillitis on the Tonsil Point, although
in the first Session I found Tonsillitis to be a match....
3a Would it, in this situation, be a better choice to check the Appendix first?
When the Tonsil Point drops again I will do this. 
3b When I use Chronic Tonsillitis, do I need to use Tonsillitis also?

4 What might be the cause the Dizziness/Vertigo? This is a big problem for her.

5 Any thoughts on the Anxiety? Both Tuberculinum remedies? Is that her Kidneys/
Bladder? Any Supports for Anxiety?

    Where the measuring sounds high or low during your 1st session.
    My personal experience is that in the 1st session this can be strange and
    then in the second session (when the body is opened up) it is more normal.

    Accupuncture can create measurements problems, even when points are
    stimulated gently without needling (like with the Life Wave Patch). I have
    experienced this several times
    Acupuncture is an attempt to balance the meridians, but by doing so often
    the real causal factors that we are trying to find seem to be masked.
    In order to prevent disturbed measurements and less effective treatment
    results, I always advise the client to stop acupuncture or any other
    meridian stimulation method.

    The Gallbladder/Liver are likely to be a big factor in her anxiety/
    depression.
    I would look for Cholecystitis. 
    I see you found Chronic Tonsillitis, which often needs to be treated
    several times and is a stress factor to the body and in that way is
    affecting the Gallbladder too. 
   
    The Headache around the eyes shows that the Stomach is playing a role too,
    but this most likely because of the Gallbladder (Wood) disturbing the
    Stomach (Earth).
   
    Sometimes the Gallbladder is hard to read, but treat her anyway.
    I would use Billiary Cirrhosis or Cholecystitis and Atropinum to calm her
    down. 
   
    The Tonsils I would treat with Chronic Tonsillitis and Tonsillitis, with
    Tonsilla Compositum and Lymphomyosot for Support. 
   
    The Dizziness/Vertigo could come from Streptococcus Heamolyticus, which
    also can cause Tonsillitis.... 
    When you measure the Tonsils next time and find (Chronic) Tonsillitis, take
    it out, wait until the point starts dropping again and try Streptococcus
    Heamolyticus,
    The Gallbladder could be a factor in the Dizziness/Vertigo, but I think it
    is more likely that it is the Tonsillitis. 
   
    I hope that will help you to get everything moving. 
    Just watch the pressure on the probe when you measure.

    Hi Judyth

    I do not understand the 4th measurement in the first session? There was no
    treatment after the 3rd measurement, but then you say you continue to
    measure with "Selenium, Little Flannel Flower, Adenomyose Gallenblase,
    Hepar, Chelidonium" in the slots?
    Every remedy that matches should be left in when you continue to measure...
    so it is strange to me that you specifically mention this.

    Another thing is: 
    I detect a measuring problem: Poliomyelitis and Anti tetanus matching on
    the Small Intestines and the Sexual Organs is incredibly strange. I have
    never seen this and also physically / energetically it seems impossible to
    me.

    Judyth:

    1 Yes Acupuncture, but also any other form of Energetic Work can mask
    drops. Acupuncture is known to raise Endorphin levels in the body...

    2 Considering the Symptoms (Anxiety, Depression) it is most likely the
    Gallbladder Meridian that causes the Headache to appear, although if you
    would just look at the location it can also be the Triple Warmer meridian.

    But the timing points definitely to the Gallbladder.The Headache appears at
    Heart Time, which is opposed to Gallbladder Time.... This means that
    Gallbladder has the least energy during those few hours.
    It does make sense to get Gallbladder Meridian symptoms during that time...

    Another note: there is no Gallbladder Point on the Triple Warmer.....
    Gallbladder issues can affect the Hormonal Secretion of the Pancreas
    though, and thus affect the Insulin Low Point.

    I also wonder in what order you have measured everything and put the
    Remedies in, because there are Remedies included in your treatment, that
    can affect the Gallbladder (Calculi Billiaris, Salmonella). When you have
    put those in before you started to measure the Gallbladder, drops might
    have been there that were now corrected....

    3a Tonsillitis can affect the Appendix, Appendicitis can affect the
    Tonsils. But if you want to correct the Tonsil point, stay on the Tonsil
    point and test remedies there....
    I find it strange though that you write, that you are going to assess the
    Appendix first next time, while if you follow the Measurement Protocol, you
    should always address the Yang Organs first. So Large Intestine (Appendix)
    always comes before the Lymphatic System (Tonsils)...

    3b This is not necessary. With Chronic Appendicitis the acute form of
    Appendicitis is added because, would there be an acute flare up of the
    inflammation, this can be dangerous, while with the Tonsils you can take
    the risk.
    A flare up is not something that will happen frequently, but an acute
    Appendicitis is not something you want to risk.

    4 Vertigo/Diziness is likely to be caused by Gallbladder and Adrenals =>
    fluctuating bloodpressure,
    But it can also be inflammation of the Inner Ear where the balance organ
    is... With all the inflamed mucous membranes/sinuses, this is not an
    unlikely option either.

    Allergies in the Upper Respiratory Tract are caused by Hypersensitivity of
    the Mucous Membranes.
    In clients with these Allergies, the Mucous Membranes are already affected.
    Usually the Cause is a Food Poisoning, but Strep/Staph, Bladder Infection
    or Whiplash (causes Irritation of the Mucous Membranes) can also be Causal.

    All of these issues could equally cause Headaches....

    Sinus Allergies are normally not caused by Appendicitis/Tonsillitis, but
    Appendicitis/Tonsillitis and Respiratory Allergies can have a common cause:
    Food Poisoning!

    5 Anxiety is a Gallbladder Symptom, but Gallbladder Problems are often
    caused by weak Adrenals (which you also measure...)
    When the Gallbladder does not drop, there is either a measuring or a
    suppression problem.

    Try to bring the Adrenals up to speed and relax the Gallbladder at the same
    time.

Clarifications from Johan

Renate
January 2013 edited January 2013 in Biontology Insights Flag

  • There are 4 probiotics in the Chiren. Bacteria dysentere is not a
    probiotic. 
  • Hepatitis A non B is mislabeled. It should read Hepatitis NON A non B which
    is also known as Hepatitis C. 
  • BAB and Brucellosis tend to cause flu-like symptoms. The other food
    poisonings tend to cause cold symptoms. Do standard treatment with rods. 
  • The left upper stomach point (closest to the foot) shows left sided jaw
    infections and the right upper stomach point shows right jaw infections.

    Thank you for the clarification. However, I need some further information.
    When you state that certain remedies tend to cause flu-like symptoms or
    cold symptoms, do you mean that after using those remedies the client will
    experience symptoms such as those? Or, do you mean that they are used for
    those types of symptoms when they match?

    Thanks,

    Hi Sylvia,

    Good question to clarify it even more.
    The bacteria Brucella Abortus Bang and Brucellosis cause these symptoms.
    The energetic (homeoptathic) remedies in the Chiren, which are made from
    those bacteria, can be used for treating flu-like symptoms. They don't
    cause it.

    Again new insights

   
    If doing scar treatment on a small thin scar, as on the face:  
    Remove the ends of the electrodes to expose pointy probes.  Then lay the
    shaft of the probes perpendicular to the scar so it touches both the scar
    and healthy skin.

    The extra “nail” points on the Lymph, Large intestine, and Triple Warmer
    are located at the corner of the nail and not on the side of the nail.

    The Bone/Cartilage, Connective Tissue, Skin and Fatty Tissue meridians on
    the feet are for general information only since the meaning of their points
    are not known: 
    Starting on the inside of the feet you find:
     1. Spleen(left)/Pancreas(right) meridian, 
     2. Liver meridian, 
     3. Cartilage/Vertebrae meridian, 
     4. Stomach meridian, 
     5. Connective tissue meridian, 
     6. Skin meridian, 
     7. Fatty Tissue meridian, 
     8. Gallbladder meridian, 
     9. Kidney meridian, 
    10. Bladder meridian

    The appendix and tonsils can affect all meridians.Therefore we might want
    to fix those drops before continuing with measuring.

    If finding Appendicitis Necroticans:  Only need to treat it by itself.  If
    finding Chronic Appendicitis, then also treat Acute Appendicitis.

    Chronic Tonsillitis can be treated without also treating the lesser
    Tonsillitis.

    Tonsillarpropfe has stored toxins. It is made out of pussy hardened
    excrements that are created when there's an inflamed area or infected
    pocket in the tonsils. These "propfen" can also be created by the tonsils
    when there's no full blown tonsillitis.

    Each form of Hepatitis is “stand alone”.  It is not necessary to treat the
    other forms along with the one you found.

    In between session (8/2)

    Symptoms:
    Bad case of poison ivy
    Constipation on and off
    Lack of energy
    Poor balance
    Short-term memory
    Burn on lip

    Improvements:
    She is able to access her creativity again => Writing poetry
    Digestion improving

    Measurement:
    Formaldehyde, Chronic Tonsillitis, Tonsillitis, Selenium
    Could not clear Hormone System or Hypoglycemic point.

    Treatment:
    Too tired for full treatment
    Spin Inversion treatment
    Scar (back, left shoulder, neck)

    In between session (8/3)

    Spin Inversion => strongly advised her to remediate EMF exposure (turning
    off router at night, unplugging computers not in use, limiting cellphone
    use, rearranging bedroom furniture and orientation of head during sleep)

    Scar treatments (left foot, toes, both ankles, tailbone, left sit bone,
    left pelvic bone, left eye and skull) We both came to realize many old
    injuries may have triggered Parkinsons, too, as she has fallen and injured

    Conclusion:
    Definite improvements observed in speech, energy, hand-eye coordination,
    and creativity.

    I have made mistakes in treating her, but it has been a growth and learning
    experience.

    She has improved, though not to the extent she would like. I will continue
    treating her.

    Chikey use between treatments has provided benefit including faster healing
    after falls, better moods, giving her back a sense of control.

    Full treatments seem to overwhelm her. Chinese doctors we have gone to in
    past have advised her that she is too weak for any type of treatment.

    EM exposure is a great disturbance to her and the elderly, as is improper
    food handling and poor quality food.

    Emotional and psychological issues have been a barrier to treatment and may
    require her to do some internal healing by herself if she is able to
    confront her demons and be honest with herself.

    Rest is a very important factor in self-healing. 

    I believe this woman's perfectionism has lead to exhaustion of her Adrenal
    glands, and Adrenal exhaustion might take many months of resting to go
    away. This, in combination with other aspects of her lifestyle, does not
    favour speedy recovery. Full results of Biontology treatment will not be
    achieved like this, so it is needed to talk about these things to at least
    create awareness.

Protocol Questions

YelyenaYelyena
November 2015 edited November 2015 in Client Safety Flag
Questions

1. If you measure Yellow Fever on Kidney knowing that it also affects the
Liver, would you give this remedy to the body when other systems are not
functioning optimally? On the first session (when you can not even measure the
Liver)?

2. If you measure Variolinum in the first session on the Nervous System but not
on the Hormone System, would you give the remedy to the body?

3. We do not have remedy for Dengue Fever. Any suggestions? Does any body have
experience with measuring a person with Dengue Fever?

    Answers

    1. That would be a hypothetical situation that is HIGHLY unlikely. I would
    never look for Yellow Fever as a remedy for the Kidneys. There are so many
    others to try first. IF, however, in this hypothetical situation, Yellow
    Fever would be the ONLY remedy that would match, then probably I would
    treat with it.
    Since I have never encountered this, or a similar situation, I cannot say
    how safe it is to treat with a nosode that effects both Kidneys and Liver
    in the first session.

    2. Why would you try to find a remedy for the Nervous System in the first
    session? In the protocol the Nervous System comes a lot later to treat, so
    when following protocol you would not try to find a remedy for it. You know
    it drops but then leave the drop. And the answer to the second question is:
    no, I would not treat with the remedy in this situation.

    3. If there are the symptoms of Dengue Fever, you can try to find another
    remedy that is used to treat similar symptoms. The focus should be on the
    meridians and not on the nosode.
    Malaria might be an option or Yellow fever but also a less exotic disease
    like Brucella Abortus Bang or Brucellosis are candidates.

    Thank you, Johan

    1. It was a hypothetical question just in case I measure it. We live on the
    Pacific islands.  

    I had my friend who came to me after year and half not checking his body by
    Chiren. It was at the end Yellow Fever that cleared everything but I did
    not measure it with certainty first time and was reluctant to give it to
    him because other remedies seems to be working.

    2. Hypothetical question again, just because Variolinum is one of common
    remedies that resonates on the Hormone System meridian I wondered how
    important it would be on the first session. It is not Toxin or Heavy Metal.

    Sometimes I check  other systems in addition to protocol to see the bigger
    picture if I have time. That is how the question about Variolinum on
    Nervous System meridian came into my mind.

    3. There is official warning about Dengue Fever on the islands now. Sure I
    will measure people if they come to me, but I was concerned about 
    emergency situations. Dengue fever virus is related to Yellow fever virus.

    1. If the other remedies work, you do not need to use Yellow Fever. So then
    you should just leave it

    2. It would be important to treat with Variolinum if there are drops on the
    Hormone Systems that react to this nosode, but not if these drops are only
    on the Nervous System meridian. The meridians are what should have focus,
    the remedies are the tools.

    If you do not overburden the body by wrong treatment, then present viruses
    will not flare up. They are opportunistic mainly and attack the weakened
    system. The cases of shingles-after-treatment that we were presented with
    where clients of practitioners who, without exception, did not following
    protocol (the main problem was treating with Heavy Metals or Liver nosodes
    too soon and often when the Kidneys were still dropping!).

    3. Measuring is most important. If Yellow Fever indeed matches the
    symptoms, and also corrects the drops on the affected systems, then you can
    use it. But it may just as well be one of the nosodes that Johan mentioned
    that matches/works better in treatment.

Treating Water/Food

    Karolina: In reading your messages, it sounds like you are advocating
    treating food and water with things like food poisoning, cadmium/strontium,
    insecticides, chlorine, etc. When I asked about this during one of my
    internships you had some valid concerns that we could be then treating
    ourselves with those same remedies when we ingest the treated food and
    water (even though our bodies may not have an issue with them). In other
    words, we might be taking in a Salmonella Paratyphi remedy when treating
    our eggs when the body might not have a problem with Salmomella. Same with
    insecticides, our body may be able to detox them on its own. Etc.

    It seemed like you and Johan had different opinions on the matter. I really
    enjoyed listening to both of you discussing it and the excellent reasoning
    behind each of your opinions. It just goes to show that biontology is
    evolving and that we practitioners need to constantly be educating
    ourselves on what is new in this emerging field.

    To be safe, I stopped treating my food and water with anything other than
    just pure light. After reading the above posts I’m rethinking my decision.

    What is your current view on the matter? Do you now believe we should treat
    our food and water? Or do you believe we should only give it pure light and
    instead only treat ourselves/clients with remedies if measured?

    Hi Renate:
    I've talked with Johan about it a lot and he has convinced me.... for now ;
    -)

    Because water can have a harmonious and disharmonious light emission too,
    it can just be treated like living beings and the light filter in the
    Chiren/Chikey won't bring anything in that will cause the water to become
    disharmonious. So only the Information will be used to Neutralize the
    Toxins/Bacteria that are truly in the Food. 

    So because of the Filter, it will work safely like this is, which makes it
    very important to always use both two fibre optic cables and not just the
    one with the light...

    Can anyone please describe shortly how we can treat food in water?
    All I have learned was standard 2-7 treatment with light to treat water.
    I have put certain food (veggies, fruits, meat) in a bowl with water and
    treated it with same program but I don't recall learning that you can add
    remedies to it. 
    I am guessing there are specific remedies for certain food like Salmonella
    for eggs for example. 
    Couple of hints would be greatly appreciated ;-)
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    March 2015 edited March 2015 Flag
    The way you describe it is right. 

    I personally still would not advise to treat with remedies. Johan has not
    tested his theory that water will not be changed into a remedy this way. I
    am not sure that water would be "disturbed" by the remedy, and since only
    disturbing factors are filtered out this may not happen... 

    Also, you don't know what is in the food, but also you may make a
    homeopathic remedy of the water/food and then take it in without the
    protection of the biophoton filter. 

    With homeopathy it works like this: when you take a remedy that is wrong
    for you, you get the actual symptoms that it otherwise would resolve... 

    Unfortunately we are too busy right now to test new theories. Anyone of you
    who is healthy can do experiments with this to find out for yourself,
    because your body is resilient and will just be disturbed temporarily if
    indeed a nosode is created by treating the water.

Lyme Disease & Co-Infections

DaphnaDaphna
December 2013 edited January 2014 in General Questions Flag
In treating clients with Lyme I have seen some really great results, but I've
also seen Lyme (and co-infectants) just continue to re-circulate with not much
of a resolve. 

Questions:
1. Why do you think some people's immune system gets back into balance and
others never seem to get out of the cycle of fighting off these infections?

2. Are there any tips you can offer on treating Lyme and it's Co-Infections
(viruses, parasites, bacterias,molds,fungus)?

3. If someone is not improving with just Chiren treatments would you suggest
they add in other alternative modalities such as anti-microbial herbs or
hyperbaric oxygen chambers? 

4. Mold and fungus are often big factors for these clients who are in an immune
compromised state... any suggestions on treating this aspect?

5. Inflamation is often sky high for these clients which can be part of keeping
them in a therapy resistant state. suggestions on bringing the inflammation
down?

    The circulation of bacteria in the blood has, in my opinion, nothing to do
    with the symptoms. Many people are without symptoms while having been
    tested positive for Lyme.
    The symptoms occur because of weaknesses in their system, which seems to be
    the cause of most diseases, and also for Lyme disease.

    Answers:
    1. There is not one recipe for Lyme, since there is not one case exactly
    the same as the other. When the treatment is successful for one person,
    this means the underlying cause has been addressed. If the treatment is not
    successful for another person, the underlying or continuing cause prevents
    the Immune Function from being corrected. There might for example be an
    ongoing environmental stressor in the way.

    2. It is important not to focus on (treat) the symptoms, but to treat the
    system in the right sequence. The system should get rid of these bugs and
    parasites.

    3. I would not advise to treat a person with the Chiren and other systems
    at the same time. It should be one or the other. If you find you have
    reached your limitations in treating a client, you can choose to refer him/
    her to another therapist or offer him/her a different modality. But not at
    the same time.
    However, my experience is that other modalities are mainly suppressing,
    which will give symptom improvement for a shorter or longer period of time,
    but in the end issues will come to the surface again. The body should do
    the healing itself...

    4. When the Mucous Membranes improve, automatically the sensitivity to mold
    and fungus will go away.

    5. How do you know that the inflammation is sky high? I do not believe
    that. It appears just the opposite, that the inflammation is chronic and
    low grade. Inflammation is a reaction of the immune system, and just that
    system does not seem to be working… 
    The acute situation of an infection, when the inflammation is very active,
    shows that the body is still capable of self-healing. Chiren treatment
    would work very fast in this case.
    So the inflammation does not need to be brought down, but the immune
    function needs to become more effective so the chronic situation (= failing
    immune response)  becomes more acute/active (= proper immune function).
    Then the true healing can happen.

    5. Clients have different markers they have tested in their blood. Like
    Rheumatoid factor or C4A that show high levels of inflammation. but i see
    how there is a lot of inflammation but it is chronic.
    My client seems to have lyme and rheumatoid. So she gets very red inflamed
    joints. 
    any suggestions for treating the rheumatoid aspect?
    thank you
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    January 2014 Flag
    With rheumatoid arthritis there is generally serious Kidney problems,
    because the Kidneys take insufficient Uric Acid out of the blood that is
    then being dumped in the joints.

    So when you want to treat that aspect, focus on the Kidneys.

Spin Inversion

I have been seeing clients for almost 7 months now and have never measured a
Spin Inversion on anyone. This worries me because the chances of no one having
a Spin Inversion doesn't seem very likely to me. Could this be something I'm
doing or something wrong with my Chiren? Is there a way to treat Spin Inversion
without drawing blood because some clients seem to be hesitant about that...

    You can treat Spin Inversion with saliva instead but it is not as powerful
    so you need to do it about 3 times instead of running the program once as
    you do with blood.

    I used to treat everyone automatically for Spin Inversion until Johan and
    Karolina told me not to do that because you are losing out on information
    but assuming someone is Spin Inverted. Since I stopped I've only measured
    it about 3 times, maybe 10% of the people. It is not as common as I would
    have thought. I find more Whiplash than Spin Inversion.

    If you are secure on your measuring skills then you probably have not come
    across as many Spin Inverted people.

    I agree with Sylvia, Whiplash is far more common than Spin Inversion.

    The 10% might be right. It also depends on the type of clients you attract.
    Sometimes practitioners get a certain kind of fame for having good results
    with Electro-Sensitivity or maybe Leukemia... And then of course the
    percentage of Spin Inverted people will rise...

    I wouldn't worry about not finding Spin Inversion. If your treatments in
    general are successful then you know you're not overlooking this. When
    someone is in Spin Inversion all the time and it is not corrected he/she
    won't have any results.

    Concerning Spin..

    I have written about the spin experience with this last client of mine..
    Forgive me for asking again.. as I am still not sure why I couldn't measure
    this person.. Tried with saliva, couldn't get any blood from her finger and
    it hurt her so much, she asked me not to do it.. 

    Questions: What other options would there be at this point. Again.. was
    this because of me? Or is it because she is so dehydrated? 
    And if this is so.. what would you do at this point?

    I apologize if I am asking this question again..but it was not clear to me
    what to do.. 
    I couldn't measure.. couldn't draw a drop of blood for a Spin Inversion
    Program, we used saliva.. but still it did not take her out of a Spin
    Inversion.. 
    I was really surprise and not knowing exactly where to go from there.

    But this women was extremely thin. 89lbs.. I did use the foot plates on her
    after I couldn't read her..and after the session of the foot plates I was
    able to measure the point. However, after that session I gave her.. I
    couldn't read her again. 

    So this all made me wonder how I could have done this differently.. what

    With saliva you should run the Spin Inversion program at least 3 times.

    But also, it might not have been a Spin Inversion and just a measurement
    problem.

    Johan mentioned it could be because of the lack of skin on her fingers, I
    mentioned that it might also be a problem of creme or oil on the skin...
    The second problem you can solve by letting your client wash her hands with
    soap, the first one you can't solve and then you just have to treat by
    symptoms...

    Maybe warm her hands up first in a sink of warm/ hot water and go on the
    side of the finger after bunching up the meaty fat area IF you know what I
    mean.  (Good medical terminology :)) Use gravity-have her hand down rather
    than up- maybe try a toe? In babies sometimes warmers are used on the heel
    before a blood test.

    Good advise for when it is bad circulation that creates the measurement

    The bunching up the meat, I'm not sure about... have to try that in a

    I noticed that rubbing hands fast on your thighs or rubbing them together
    helps. You get them nice and warm and the blood flow is much better. When I
    prick the finger at the tip the blood comes out very easily and sometimes
    takes a minute for it to stop.

    We have been advised by a colleague instead of pricking the finger using
    the ear lobe to draw a tiny drop of blood as it is painless and seldom if
    ever felt by the client while it can not be seen by the client either. If
    you take the round shape of the ear lobe with 3 fingers of one hand, then
    swiftly pierce the frontal central low side with the other. Small prick is
    ok. If no blood shows, you might want to use another needle, and if you
    want to do things really correct use a disinfectant on the skin first. We
    use the tiniest single-use and one-touch testing needle, as short as 4 mm
    max, as you do not need to worry about piercing your own finger in the
    process. Our clients have been comfortable with this procedure so far. If
    there is a reason not to use the ear lobe instead of the finger, if known
    by Karolina or Johan, they might want to correct me on this information.

Obsessive Compulsive Syndrome

Dolores Argento
August 2014 edited August 2014 in Psychology Flag
Gender: Male

Age: 25

Problem 
Has been on Prozac since he was 15 years old for depression. He finally was
able to wean off the drug. This uncovered the fact that he is moderate to
occasionally severe OCD. Apparently, the Prozac was masking this problem for
many years. This probably should have been the diagnosis when he was 15 years
old but they just wrote him a script for the medication. The underlying OCD
became so severe the doctor convinced him to go back on 10 mg of Prozac
temporarily.

Background
 I have not treated this client. He was treated by a practitioner in New York
approximately one year ago and became very sick and unable to get out of bed
for 2 days. He is reluctant to try this again. I have been treating his mother
for some time and she is desperate to help him. They have a Chikey so I
suggested using the footplates and dyslexia program daily with just light.

Question 
How can I approach this case to give them the best result without making him
extremely sick? Should they keep using the Chikey with just light for a while
or would it be better to attempt a treatment according to protocol? Are there
any special considerations when working with this extremely fragile emotional
state?

    Unfortunately we get more feedback like this from clients who have seen
    practitioners that do not adhere to the protocol guidelines. Sometimes a
    name is mentioned, but normally names are kept from us so that we cannot do
    anything else than, again, emphasise to all that although not everyone will
    react negatively to random and excessive treatment, fragile people will
    suffer… 

    Chikey treatments do not address the core problem as you cannot measure and
    assess the underlying cause. So if you get the chance to see him in person
    this would be best. Understand that you need to start all over again,
    discard the first treatment he has had (so also use Anti-Tetanus and
    Poliomyelitis again and treat all scars).
    His practitioner may also have overlooked a Spin Inversion, Whiplash…

    I need to have more symptoms to give specific suggestions, but from the
    five element perspective, OCD is the combination of Metal and Wood
    imbalance (Metal destroying Wood). It would not surprise me at all if he
    has Appendicitis (Chronic or Necroticans) and Chronic Tonsillitis… or at
    least some heavy food poisoning or imbalance of the intestinal flora. And
    as a result Gallbladder/Liver issues.

    With OCD the person has grown a series of behavioural patterns that are
    addictive and not likely to be broken by just getting the energetics
    balanced. Letting go of patterns will become easier when the energetic and
    physical attachments are broken, but without a conscious effort of the
    client to let go nothing will happen. 
    First, however, you need to treat (in the right order of the protocol) to
    the point that Hormone System, Large Intestine, Lymphatic System, Lungs,
    Gallbladder and Liver at least are cleared and the physical symptoms
    connected to these organ systems are gone too. Only then you (or another
    specialised therapist like a psychologist) will be able to help him let go
    of these patterns easily, naturally and without force.
   
    All needs to happen at the right moment. Forcing him to change when the
    energetic and physical attachment is not gone yet will be
    counterproductive.

    Karolina, I truly appreciate the thoughtfulness of your response. I'm not
    sure how long he will be staying in the area or if he plans to return to
    New York soon. Therefore, I don't know if we can really accomplish what is
    required here.

    Due to scheduling issues, I sometimes cannot schedule treatments for my
    clients as often as I would like. Many of them use the Chikey with just
    light to keep them going between sessions. This appears to work quite well
    especially for the very fragile ones. Just from my own observations, it
    seems to strengthen them so they tolerate my treatments better. I'm just
    wondering if strengthening him somewhat before starting the regular
    protocol would be a good idea?

    Also, if I understand correctly, counseling would be an integral part of
    healing. I know he has done some in the past but not sure if he is
    presently undergoing counseling. Would it be more effective to do the
    treatments/ counseling simultaneously or wait until we've made some
    progress with the energetic/physical?

    The counselling is always the last stage. The energetic/physical attachment
    needs to be gone before any real psychological changes can be made. Trying
    to achieve something in to early a stage can work counterproductive and
    unnecessary discouraging to the client.

    Weekly treatments are always best, so if there's no other way, the weekly
    Chikey treatments in between sessions are of course a good idea, even if it
    is just treating with the light without remedies.

    picture of how to proceed. Appreciate the insight.

Rabies Vaccination In Humans

rondajmcdougalrondajmcdougal
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Medication Flag
The mother of a 20 year old female called because her daughter began having
tremors in her hands a few months ago. I have not yet seen her.

She had been bitten by a cat when she was younger (they couldn't find the cat
to be tested for rabies) and had to go through the set of rabies vaccinations.

She also had 2 neck injuries when she was younger (skiing and playing
volleyball) and she is in a lot of pain and has memory problems from this.

Of course I am going to start with the protocol, but my question is...
Do we have a match to the rabies vaccinations humans receive that I can measure
on her? (Serum Ovile, Mercury??)

Also, would it be possible the tremors in her hands are from her injury
(whiplash - separation of the pituitary gland governing her body) and not the
calcium metabolism issue with gallbladder caused by vaccines?

Thank you
Ronda

    Hi Ronda,

    Part of the Rabies Vaccination is Serum based, just like the Anti-Tetanus
    shot. Serum based vaccines have a detrimental effect on the Para-Thyroid
    and thus the calcium metabolism. Too much calcium in the blood as well as
    calcium deficiency can cause tremors....

    The Anti-Tetanus vaccination contains horse serum. I found on the internet
    that the Anti-Rabies vaccination contains either horse serum or human
    serum.... So the Anti-Tetanus nosode might already help with the side
    effects of the Rabies vaccination. 
    But if this is not enough to balance the Parathyroid point you might also
    need the remedy Serum Ovile, which is made from sheep serum.
   
    With all these "attacks" on the Para-Thyroid because of the vaccinations
    and then the Whiplashes on top of that, I feel her symptoms might have to
    do with the disturbed Calcium Metabolism primarily. (the Gallbladder is
    involved in every imbalance/disease, since it always reacts on stress and
    all imbalances are stress to the body...)

    So probably you'll find Calcification in the Arteries (Barijodeel,
    Aurumheel), Kidney stones (Calculi Renales), Gallstones (Calculi Billiaris)
    and Osteoporosis (Calcoheel).

    Graphites and Circulo have higher potencies (D30, D200) of Calcium
    Carbonicum, which might also be helpful if you have to deal with calcium
    build up in the body. 

    Most likely there's no need for the nosode of the Rabies virus
    specifically.

    Hi Karolina,
    I have seen this young woman a total of 4 times now and she is remarkably
    better. The Anti-Tetanus and the Serum Ovile worked excellent for balancing
    against her rabies vaccinations, so I wanted to follow-up on this to let
    everyone else know if they ever run across this. 

    Of course I have had to work on her parathyroid for her calcium metabolism
    also, but she has gone from almost all points dropping on her 1st and 2nd
    visit to only small & large intestine and gallbladder drops on her 4th
    visit. (she has had many, many issues so has come a long way in a short
    time, it is amazing how the body can heal itself).

    Thanks for all your great insight and help with this.

Parkinson's (?)

Jennifer IveyJennifer Ivey
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Hello Karolina and Johan. I have not submitted anything yet, so this is my
first try at putting together a hopefully successful treatment for one of my
certification profiles. Please comment and let me know if I am on the right
track.

Client: 56 year old woman. Symptoms started three years ago, Diagnosed with
Parkinson’s a year a half ago. Got my contact from your website – yay!

Childhood: Traumatic – alcoholic mother

Symptoms: tremors, insomnia, weak muscles, problems concentrating, memory loss,
anxiety, lower backache, heavy left leg, needs to drink water at night,
frequent urination, weak left shoulder. Some dermatitis and arthritis. Lots of
stress at work. Doesn’t feel “sick”

Medical status: tummy tuck, liposuction in thighs, taking many supplements,
Azilezt (Parkinson’s medicine –endorphins I am guessing?), bladder in mesh
sling.

1st Session

Measurement and Treatment:
Drops all over. Did Spin Inversion and Whiplash treatment - I did not properly
test to see what that cleared, although I noticed that Whiplash “lightened her
load” of drops a little bit. Scar treatment all across tummy tuck scar.

>12 Program:
Triple Warmer - Anti-Tetanus, Poliomyelitis, Serum Ovile, Pertussis, Mercury
Circulation - Barjiojeel, Placenta
Kidneys - Cystopyelonephritis

Footplates:
Triple Warmer - Formeldahyde
Small Intestine (L) - Brucella Abortus Bang
Large Intestine (R) - Chronic Appendicitis and Appendicitis
Gallbladder - Adenomyose Gallenblase, Calculi Billiaris, Calculi Renalis
Liver - Penicillinum

BIG Mistake: didn’t pay attention to Adrenals, gave Berberis & Selenium
2-7 year Program afterwards.
Therefore treatment not correct, but hopefully some good was achieved.

Communication during session:
Talked to her about organic diet.
She had stopped supplements before coming to appointment as I had suggested.
Also discussed reducing medication and moving cell phone and radio phone from
bedside.
Found her extremely dehydrated because she said she had to urinate every 20
minutes otherwise. Therefore hard to measure as well.

2nd Session

Client very cooperative and trying to make all changes that I suggested. She
noticed that she needed to urinate less, so she was happy to bump up the water
intake in order to rehydrate.

Did scar treatment on tummy tuck and old injury on shoulder
Question: Is it best to do it before or after first measurement??

Measurement and Treatment:
Whiplash, but no Spin Inversion
Again, not realizing the importance, (!!) did not test Adrenals properly

After all measuring, I tried the Gallbladder nosodes in Circulation to test it,
and it cleared all Circulation drops, (5 element theory – yay!)

>12 Program:
Triple Warmer (Parathyroid) - Diptheria
Circulation
Large Intestine
Nervous System
Gall Bladder - Adenomyose Gallenblase, Billiary Cirrhosis, Cholestycis, Injeel
–cho
Kidneys - Cystopyelonephritis ( again, Dumb: because I didn’t know that
Adrenals would fix it!)
Belladonna

Footplate Treatment (after 2nd measurement):
Triple Warmer (Parathyroid) - Variolinum
Nervous System (L) - Varicellen
Circulation (R) - Atropinum (Barijodeel and Aurumheel a better choice if they
worked?))
Large Intestine (R) - Appendicitis Necroticans
Lung (R)
Lymphatic System (R) - Chronic Tonsillitis
Gallbladder (R) - Calcul Billaris and Calcul Renales
Liver - Hep A non B (sure now that was wrong)

I was pleased with how the treatment went, but I continued to read the forum
very intensely to improve. When I did, I read about Adrenal fatigue. Figured
this patient might also have it. After reading Johan’s comments I decided to
try it on her next time, with much more careful measuring.

3rd Session

Client very enthusiastic. Sleeping better, drinking lots, reading a book that I
gave her called “You Can Heal Your Life”. She loves it. Admitted that she saw a
“natural” doctor (for the last time) who told her that her lead levels were
high so he gave her an injection called DMPS to help release the toxins. She
was sorry that she did. Tremor the same.

Measurement and Treatment:
No Whiplash, no Spin Inversion

>12 year Program:
Triple Warmer - no drops except for inflamed Adrenals!! (duh…) - Berberis,
Selenium (fixed Kidneys!)
Circulation - no drops but low sound, Barijodeel (support?), was nervous to
leave it untouched...
Nervous system, (lower points - L) - Plumbum
Small Intestine (L+R)
Large Intestine (R) - Appendicitis Necroticans, Belladonna (Lymph and Lung were
fixed too)
Lung (R)
Lymph (R)
Arteries (R) - (support? Very low sound)
Bladder (R)
Kidneys (R)
Liver (R)
Stomach lowest point - Ulcus Duodeni

Footplate Treatment (after measuring):
Nervous system (L) - PCB
Large Intestine (R) - Trichomonaden, Tuberculinum, Tuberculinum Bovinum (
Question: is Bovinum wrong to use?)
Circulation (L)
Liver - Formaldehyde (measured) and Ubichinon and Co-enzyme for support
Adrenals - Aesculus (help clear injection and adrenals not dropping but
inflamed)

Scar Treatment: repeated (Question: should I do Scar treatment before or after
first measurement?)

Results: Client emailed me in the evening to tell me that tremors were already
lessening. ☺

You haven’t heard from me, but I have patients who are not very ill and help me
to learn. Most of my major learning has been on myself. (a separate email).The
forum is FABULOUS. I am addicted to it. I am almost embarrassed by the first
two enclosed sessions, but the third was a big improvement. My measurements and
recording are much more careful now.
I learned about the Tuberculinum for tremors from reviewing the synthesis
video!

My biggest question is: When should you treat Circulation? I assume after you
know what causes it to drop. If you can’t find that initially, treat it on the
first 12> ideally?

Comments would be much appreciated. You can see my learning curve. Thank you
Karolina and Johan. I really love this work and appreciate all of yours.

Jennifer (Toronto)

    In the first place, you use too many nosodes on the footplates. There might
    be one or two nosodes but no more if you've used all nosodes in the hand
    treatment too.

    Most points should be cleared with the hand rods.

    Scar treatments should be done before 1st treatment but after measurement.
    This way you learn what influence the scars have on the measurements.

    When to treat the Circulation is a matter of assessment. The Circulation
    meridian is a very important Yang organ so should be treated before the Yin
    organs. I am of the opinion that it should be treated first before the
    other Yang organs but often this is not logical. Often the Circulation is
    corrected by remedies that are used to correct the other Yang organs.

    Very often the Circulation meridian is affected by the Gallbladder meridian
    and then this Gallbladder needs to be rectified in order to get the
    Circulation meridian right.

    I notice that in the 3rd session there are no drops for the Gallbladder
    meridian, this is strange as the Gallbladder is often a major contributor
    to Tremors and Circulation issues and is always responsible for Ulcers and
    these symptoms were not gone.

    Further: due to the detox process the Circulation might respond frequently
    to Aesculus, a remedy for "dirty" blood.
    If you measure Baryodeel, it means Calcification. It means we know that
    there are Calcium deposits in the Blood Vessels, but we do not know how
    much has been deposited. So it might need a few treatments to clean the
    Vessels. 

    I would not start treating Liver until all or most of the Yang organs are
    clean, unless the Liver meridian measures that it is the cause of the
    Gallbladder drops.

    Thank you for your clarification on Circulation and the Gallbladder. 

    My client came back today and I wish I could say it went well, but it
    didn’t. Hopefully I gave her something good for her body to work with,
    however. I measured her for Spin Inversion and treated it. I then checked
    to see that that worked and proceeded to measure all over. I then did her
    Scar Treatment on her Tummy Tuck and noticed how the energy in her Large
    Intestine came up. 

    Measurement:
    Adrenals (still inflamed, probably dropping, hard to tell. Definitely not
    wet) 
    Circulation (L & R) 
    Arteries
    Thyroid 
    Other points towards nail on right hand 
    Nervous System (close to nail) 
    Bladder
    Kidney
    Stomach
    Liver 
   
    >12 Year Program
    Chronic Appendicitis, Chronic Tonsillitis, Gallbladder: Cholescytis,
    Salmonella Barijodheel, Placenta Cerebrum, Tuberculinum 
   
    BIG mistake: did not get Thyroid balanced and was unable to. It also became
    inflamed like the Adrenals and made a high pitched sound. It was not wet. I
    was careful to dry the area. 
   
    I tried things like Whiplash, Causticum and Trichomonaden, and many others
    on the Tripple Warmer, but no luck. As a result, I gave her the footplate
    treatment , but her hands would not balance. 
   
    As she drives a couple of hours to come and see me, I did my best to give
    her what I thought would help her at least. We ran out of time. At least
    her feet balanced. I tried Thyroidea, no luck, but gave it to her anyway. 
   
    Thalamus Berberis Aesculus Calculi Biliaris, Calculi Renales, Chelidonium.
    Should have given Aurumheel for Arteries I have had this happen once before
    with someone’s Thyroid, although thankfully the body had sorted it out by
    the following visit. 
   
    Input much appreciated. :)

    You said "I would not start treating Lliver until all or most of the  Yang
    organs are clean, unless the Liver meridian measures it is the cause of the
    Gallbladder drops"  Would you elaborate on  this - I'm not sure what this

    drops? Thank you judyth

    Hi Judyth. If the Gallbladder drops and you can't clear it with a
    Gallbladder nosode, then you can try a Liver nosode and see if it make the
    drop go away.

    I am learning SO MUCH from this forum. I have about 8 pages of notes that
    are now invaluable to me. 

    I am still having a challenge with this Parkinson's patient. Her Insulin
    Point and Adrenal Point on her left hand are quite Inflamed and difficult
    to read. I know in her case that the Insulin Point should be treated with a
    Gallbladder remedy, but I wish that one of the Nosodes would make it sound
    better. It's hard to even tell if it is no longer dropping. The Adrenals
    are the same thing. I have put in Selenium and Berberis, but it doesn't
    last.

    She is on a High Potassium Diet now for a couple of weeks. I know that the
    Adrenals and Kidneys are closely linked. Her feet are difficult to
    measure. 

    Question: 
    What should I be looking for in the Kidneys to help the Adrenals? I have
    addressed Infection and Calcul Renales already. 
    What about Toxins on the Adrenals? She stopped using Cortisone on her right
    hand a month ago for some Dermatitis. Might that be it? Any other
    suggestions? 
    Her Bladder is in a "Sling". I didn't think that had a bearing on Adrenals
    or Kidney but maybe? 

    She is so cooperative and really doing everything right at home, including
    changing Wifii to landline at home.

    The Insulin point on the left hand should not be treated with Gallbladder
    remedies. The point that should be treated with Gallbladder remedies is on
    the right hand.

    The Insulin point on the left hand always comes into line when the other
    points on that side of the Triple Warmer have been corrected.

    With Inflamed Adrenals and Insulin Point you probably mean that sounds are
    higher? This has nothing to do with the Organs, but with the local
    condition of the Skin (inflammation?)

    You say that she has stopped using Cortisone on her right hand???? What do
    you mean by this? Did she have a skin condition there?

    The Adrenals affect the Energy in the Kidney but not the other way round.
    Why is the patient on a Potassium rich diet?

    What have you determined as the cause of the Parkinsons symptoms? Is it
    Calcification or Gallbladder?
    In any case the patent has Circulation issues but even these could be
    caused by either of them.

    That the Bladder is in a Sling, could have an influence on the Kidneys if
    Urine gets backed up but never on the Adrenals. 

    Toxins generally do not go to the Adrenals. If the Adrenals keep dropping,
    I sometimes go the Sex Organs. An Ovarial Cyst could also influence the
    Adrenals. 

    I really have too little information. I do not know all the symptoms and I
    do not have all the  Measurements.
  • 
    Jennifer IveyJennifer Ivey
    April 2013 edited April 2013 Flag
    Thank you Johan. I did find an Ovarial Cyst last time and I thought that
    the Adrenals sounded better, having treated for the Cyst and Selenium and
    Berberis in the Footplate treatment, but I didn't understand the
    relationship. 

    I thought that a Potassium rich diet would help to feed the Adrenals. Not
    correct? 

    My former training had suggested a few Toxins that could affect the
    Adrenals, like Cortisone, but that is obviously incorrect (as usual! There
    is a lot to unlearn...) She was using a cream with Cortisone on some
    Dermatitis on her hand, but no longer. Not sure what you don't understand?
    She is using a more natural ointment now instead. 
   
    Putting the Gallbladder remedies in the Circulation fixed the Circulation
    drops, so I am concentrating on those two systems the most. I think now
    that I realize the importance of the Cyst and the Adrenals, that I will
    have more confidence for getting everything else right. As for the
    Gallbladder remedies on the Right Hand, I shall assume that the Nosode that
    works that best should go there, until only support is needed. I am also
    keeping an eye on Appendicitis etc. Thanks again.

    Hello Johan,
    Since we are talking about the Adrenals...
    I have a male client. At his last appointment I balanced Sex Organs point
     on Triple Warmer (right hand) with Adenoma Prostata and Adrenal point
    (left hand) with Ovarial Cyst. That was the only one remedy that worked for
    Adrenals.

    Artificial Cortisone is damaging to the Adrenals, since it interferes with
    the natural Cortisone production of these organs. 

    However Cortisone as a Remedy has not been found to be very effective in
    treatment and is hardly ever measured on the Adrenals... other Remedies
    like Selenium and Berberis are better in restoring Adrenal function as a
    whole, including Cortisone production, than the Remedy Cortisone.

    A similar situation you'll find to be true for Marihuana, there's no Remedy
    of this drug needed to balance its negative effects. Viscum will be far
    more useful than inverted or homeopathic Marihuana.

    Follow-up: 
    6th session 
    Wow, she is so much better! Started with Appendicitis Necroticans, all
    three levels of Appendicitis gone now. Started with all three levels of
    Gallbladder, all gone too, except a little more needed for Gallstones. 
    Circulation much improved. 
    Adrenals fine - that link to Ovarial Cyst was the key. The Cyst was gone
    this time, but found Carcinoma Uteri. A little bit of Food Poisoning and
    Tonsillitis. Worked on the Liver and sent her home. 

    Cured for her will be no more Tremors. When I give her Tuberculinum, they
    subside, but are usually back by the end of the week. If you have any more
    brilliant ideas for tremors, please suggest! Thank you.

    There are no three levels for the Gallbladder. There's level 1:
    Cholecystitis and level 2: Billiary Cirrhosis, but no more.
    Adenomyose Gallenblase is something completely different.

    How do you know for sure it is Tuberculinum that makes the Tremors go away?
    You did so much more each Session... (Tuberculinum has this indication, but
    also Barijodeel).

    When the Tremors keep coming back you haven't found the Cause yet. 

    Luesinum and Medorrhinum can also Cause Tremors.
    What did you find on the Liver?
  • 
    Jennifer IveyJennifer Ivey
    May 2013 edited May 2013 Flag
    I have treated her with Barijodeel about three times along with other
    Circulation Remedies. 

    I thought that you said that Tuberculinum helped with Tremors, but as it
    doesn't seem to be having a lasting effect if at all, I need to find
    something else. 

    I expect that her Sex Glands will have improved after giving her Ovarial
    Cyst and Carcinoma Uteri, so now seems like a good time to look for
    Luesinum and/or Medorrhinum. On the Liver, I found Pennicillum and I gave
    her Sutoxol as well. I will be able to zero in on the Liver more tomorrow.

    I saw the client this afternoon. 

    Sex Glands - Luesinum, Medorrihinum, Klimatheel. 
    Liver - Carcinoma Hepatis, Lymes's (supported with Galium and Hepar)

    Question: Might I expect to see Lyme's again?

    She is fully expecting / hoping to be better by the 12th appointment
    (because of information on the website). 

    In order for her symptoms to be gone, I have to eliminate the Tremors and
    give her back more ease of movement with her left side - Hands, Feet,
    Coordination. I also gave her Cerebrum. There was little need to treat much
    else as she is feeling very well and her measurements reflect that.

    What do you mean with "a good time to look for Luesinum and/or Medorrhinum

    Try to also treat the Veins. With Cysts there is always a problem in the
    Veins and Circulation.

    To get back to the questions that Johan didn't answer...

    "I thought that you said that Tuberculinum helped with Tremors, but as it
    doesn't seem to be having a lasting effect if at all, I need to find
    something else"

    When a Remedy has indications for a certain symptoms, like in this case
    Tuberculinum for Tremors, that doesn't necessarily mean it is always going
    to work. You'll have to carefully observe how your treatments effect the
    condition... and Like Johan says, when symptoms are only temporarily
    relieved, the Cause is still not addressed.

    "Might I expect to see Lyme's again?"

    With Lyme's Disease there's no need to focus too much on the Lyme itself,
    the focus should be on the overall condition and other remedies are usually
    more effective than Lyme.
    Also, measuring Lyme does not necessarily mean that there are actually Lyme
    Spirochetes in the Body. We can't truly diagnose with the Chiren, since the
    information of a Remedy will resonate with all Conditions similar to
    Lyme's.

Hyperhydrosis - Difficult Measurement

Carlaspierdijk
February 2013 edited February 2014 in Measurement Flag
Client: 
Girl, 16 years old, with hyperhydrosis came to me. 

Symptoms:
Extreme sweating => first noticed at age 4, when the sweat of her hands soaked
the paper while drawing
Sweating comes from both Hands and Armpits
Holding the Glass Rods 10 seconds => water everywhere
Symptoms appeared after Vaccination, and her brother has the same issue.

Medical Intervention:
Not yet => doctors suggest Botox-Injections in her armpits.

Measurement is really difficult, today I didn't trust the measurements at all.

Measurement and Treatment: 
Spin Inversion

After treating the Vaccinations, drops on: 
Liver, 
Gallbladder, 
Circulation, 
Lymphatic system 

Questions:
1. Is anyone familar with hyperhidrosis? 

2. Anyone an idea how I can measure well?

    Maybe do as Johnty suggested, have her put it behind the bend in her knee,
    and have her put her foot on the bottom piece of the chair so it won't come
    out as the knee will stay beent that way (Put a towel on the floor in case
    it drops). This might help.

Take a Spin in a Prius

I finally convinced my client she was getting into Spin Inversion whilst
driving her Hybrid. She found a solution.

I will let you know if it appears effective

    I believe that Johan said that only sheepskin seats, carpet, etc will help
    to minimize the effects of the electrical output being emitted by the car.
    She may want to buy that and it will feel more comfy too.  ;)

    Hi Johnty,

    Earthing can help with getting rid of the Electrical Charge in the car, but
    not with the Magnetic Field unfortunately. It is this field that is most
    important in causing Spin Inversion.... 

    So this solution your client found is probably not going to work. 

    Some clients are helped by using sheepskin, although often this is not
    enough either. The best solution will still be changing cars.. a difficult
    decision for most.

    I seem to be seeing more and more clients who drive hybrid cars.  Yet many
    of them are reluctant to believe that the cars may be harming them.

    Does anyone know of any good articles or websites that explain how hybrid
    cars can cause harm? 

    So far I've only found anecdotal stories and/or articles that say hybrids
    are not much of a problem.  I think it would be helpful to be able to pass
    this on to others.

    Thanks!

    I have had to clients.. same issues.. continuous Spin Inversion every
    session.. but they both are almost aggressive when I mention the car could
    be the cause.. They refuse to even consider it.. 
   
    I would love some "proof" or some article to show them.. 
    Anyone who has info that we could share? It would be so appreciated.. 
   
    One women has tumor on the brain.. and  a mouth full of root canals.. She
    is offended that I would suggest that she get the root canals removed..not
    to mention that I suggested changing cars..

    I can't offer any proof other than what you're already offering....she's in
    Spin Inversion. But it's also possible that she gets in Spin Inversion just
    from sleeping/being in her home or in front of the computer (regardless of
    whether it's wifi or ethernet).

    To Johnty, I wonder what your client discovered about the grounding bans.
    My naturopath has recommended putting a grounding pad under my lap top
    which is emanating a great deal of electrical field.

    Big problem:
    Hybrid cars are pushed as the conscious choice. People invest in them and
    then have to learn it has not been a good choice… This requires a big
    change in thinking again. Just telling people this is the way it is is
    usually not going to work if a lot of money and ideas have been invested… 

    The best thing I think we can do is help clients to experience the
    difference. Maybe suggest to not use their hybrid car for a week or two
    weeks and rent a normal car for that time. If the car was the cause of
    their complaints, for sure they will notice a difference. 
    Of course the day they stop using their hybrid car is also the day that you
    give them a session, so they can experience the full effect of the change
    in cars.

    Root canals are more difficult even, as you cannot advise people to take
    them out for a little while ;-)
    What you can do with so much resistance is just continue to treat normally
    with a focus on the teeth, that is if this is also the cause that you
    measure. 
    If this gives big improvements in their complaints, you can again emphasise
    that what you have done, most likely, is merely symptom treatment, and that
    as long as those root canals are in there, symptoms will soon return or get
    worse again after stopping the Chiren sessions… if this then is experienced
    she will have some proof that convinces her.
    In case of brain tumor this, of course, may be too time consuming.

    I agree that these are difficult situations. We do not want to oppose
    people in their freedom of choice, but at the same time we really want to
    get the right information to them so they can make a well advised choice.

    Good articles from a third party are always helpful. About hybrid cars I
    have not found them yet..

Numbness in the Legs - MS/Lyme?

Barbaralee
January 2014 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
62 year old female

Symptoms:
Numbness in legs
Bruises easily
Muscle spasms
Excellent teeth => no cavities
Feet blue and very cold.
Sleeping fine.
Regular bowel movement
Very bloated
NO typical Lyme symptoms (e.g. no fever or swollen glands)
Claims to be resistant to all therapies, except for a terrible reaction to
heavy metal IV's

History:
No tonsil/throat issues as a child
Pesticide exposure => In Italy she lived next to a farm which sprayed a lot of
pesticides
Healthy diet.
No drugs.
No surgeries.
Physical exercise => muscle strengthening and stretching.
History of seizures => solved by medication (valproic acid)
Sudden loss of feeling and numbness from the waist down (2002)

Medical diagnoses & interventions:
Demyelination Syndrome (2002)
IGENEX positive for Lyme (2003)
Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency (2010) => azygos veins (feeding vein
to the legs) 80% closed
Treatment cleared the blockage => resulted in NO relief or feeling back into
her legs.
High levels of mercury/lead => reacted so terribly to the IV's, she stopped
after two

Medication:
Valproic Acid => used for 9 years

1st Session

Measurement:
Whiplash (measured and treated)

Parathyroid
Thymus
Hyper Insulin (hypoglycemia)
Adrenal Glands
Large Intestine (L) - nail point => Brucella Abortus Bang
Heart (L) - 1 point
Lymphatic System (L) - Sinus/Tonsils

Hypo Insuline (diabetes)
Veins (R) - 1 point
Nervous System (R) - 1 point
Large Intestine (R) - 2 points
Thyroid

>12 yrs Program:
Poliomyelitis, Anti-Tetanus, Biliary Cirrhosis, Atropinum, Cholecystitis,
Brucella Abortus Bang

2nd Measurement:
Gallbladder (L+R) - 1 point

Footplates:
Cerebrum (MS), Viscum, Placenta, Aesclus, Berberis, Selenium, Spascupreel (Lots
of circulation support)

Thoughts:
Because of her muscle spasms I added Spascupreel, because I haven't found
Atropinum enough

Second treatment:

Response:
Disorientation the next day, otherwise nothing.

Measurement and >12 yrs Program:
Pituitary => Insecticides
Parathyroid => Insecticides
Thymus => Little Flannel Flower
Adrenal => Lyme, Selenium
Insulin High (hypoglycaemia)
Circulation (R) - 1 point

Symptom Treatment:
Scar Treatment => Spine and both Legs

Third Treatment:

Response:
She says none, although she seemed to be walking better.
Feet still very cold. Large bruises too.

Measurement:
No drops

Spin Inversion Program

Measurement: with Psorinum and Schwefheel in the slots:

Tonsils point (L)
Sinus point (L)
Anus point (L) => Botulism
Nervous System (L) - 2 points
Organ degeneration (L) - Faulty vegetative control
Heart (L) - point

Insulin (R)
Veins (R) - 1 point
Large Intestine (R) - 2 points (Appendix)

Kidney (L) - 1 point
Kidney (R) - 1 point

Botulism, Selenium

Footplates:
Aesculus, Tonsilla, Atropinum, Ubichonal, Barijodeel, Cirulo, Hammelis,
Aluminum

Questions:
1. When I initially measured no drops I concluded there were two possibilities,
"Spin Inversion" or "Therapy Resistance" even if only emotionally so. I treated
for Spin Inversion, and then put Psorinum and Schwefheel into the slots and
began to measure. Is this the right procedure?

2. The Anus point didn't react to the usual remedies, but Food Poisonings. Is
this odd?

3. On the Triple Warmer both Hypo Insulin as well as Hyper Insulin dropped. Is
it unusual that both drop?

4. Because of her unresponsiveness I thought se might therapy resistant? She
claims to be unresponsive to most therapies, except for heavy metal chelation.

5. Why is the nervous system not dropping if she has high levels of lead and
mercury in her system?

6. Should I have focused on the Appendix and Tonsils? I measured drops there,
but I've been concentrating on Triple Warmer, kidney and Circulation which seem
to be her biggest complaints.

    Answers:
    1. You are confusing Therapy Resistance (needs treatment with Psorinum and
    Schwefheel) with Endorphin Mask (measure with Plumbum, Viscum, Atropinum),
    but it seems that the issue of not being able to measure was solved already
    by using the Spin Inversion Program.
   
    Here's some information on the different issues (copied from this forum):
    "Hidden Spin Inversion: If someone has a Hidden Spin Inversion, it is
    obvious that you do not find any normal Spin Inversion drops. The only
    indication is that the points do not react on treatment, although you did
    find remedies to match. After the Spin Inversion treatment points that did
    not react on normal treatment will react again. If they don't, Spin
    Inversion was not the cause.

    Endorphins masking Spin Inversion: In Spin Inversion the body is always
    under stress, so the readings might be blocked by Endorphins. In this
    situation some drops are not showing, or no drops at all. Running a Spin
    Inversion Program will make drops measurable again.

    Lack of improvement: There might be an environmental situation that
    influences progress. One reason might be that the moment the person leaves
    your office and gets home or in his/her car, he/she might get into a Spin
    Inversion again, stopping the results.

    Therapy Resistance: Measurements can either improve or stay the same, but
    there is no improvement of the physical condition. Physical responsiveness
    might improve by treating with Psorinum and Schwefheel."

    "An Endorphin Mask is caused by a highly stressful situation to the body,
    when you address the cause the mask will drop. 

    Using the combination Viscum/Plumbum/Atropinum is a generalistic approach
    to lower Endorphins, but it might not be needed when the mask for example
    was caused by the Whiplash. ……….
    Another reason for Endorphin production might be Spin Inversion.. in this
    case the Spin Inversion is not measurable as such. 
    Yet another reason, is a more extreme reaction to the vaccinations than
    usual, when you then put Poliomyelitis or Anti-Tetanus in for measurement
    or give short treatment with these remedies (2-7yrs) often suppression is
    lifted too.
    Gallbladder Nosodes (Gallbladder problems cause/reflect stress) might also
    lift suppression.

    The Endorphin "recipe" was created by the following reasoning:
    Viscum => To balance the Pituitary, which is the gland that controls
    Endorphin production.
    Atropinum => To relax the body, since stress (all kinds of stress!) is the
    cause for Endorphin production
    Plumbum => Because of the homeopathic principle "cure like with like". Lead
    poisoning causes suppression by effecting the nerves in a way that they
    release high levels of Endorphins."

    2. No not odd at all. There are specific Anus Nosodes, but of course the
    Anus is just part of the Intestinal Tract and can be infected by Bacteria.

    3. Also not unusual. It shows a badly regulated sugar metabolism. More like
    an in between phase of Hypoglycemia and Diabetes.

    4. It is far to early to think about her being Therapy Resistant. First try
    to correct her Energetic System, when after this she still doesn't show
    improvement you'll know she's Therapy Resistant and can try to unblock her
    System with Schwefheel and Psorinum.

    5. First of all, a severe reaction to heavy metal chelation is not
    necessarily a sign of detox, it can very well be the response to the
    chemicals shot directly into the blood stream (IV). In Biontology IV's are
    always considered unnatural and harmful to the body (you can measure this
    right after). These IV's are similar to medical drugs in that they might
    work on some level but disrupt the system on another. To me it difficult to
    understand that in alternative "natural" medicine chemical IV's are
    embraced as healthy, while there's so much negative perception about other
    synthetic drugs….
    Second, the Nervous System is not the first System you need to treat, and
    it might show up in a later stage, when the body has already got rid of a
    lot of Toxins. The Heavy Metals might be so stressful to the Nervous System
    that this is the exact reason why it doesn't show.
    But whatever it is, do not treat with Heavy Metals early on (especially
    when there is a Heavy Metal burden that needs to be detoxed) in the first
    couple of sessions when the Yang Organs and Kidneys are not ready to expel
    yet! This can give severe and unwanted reactions, often mistaken for
    necessary "healing reactions".

    6. It all depends, but when there's Appendicitis (in any form) it often
    affects so many other Systems than just the Intestines that it is usually a
    good choice to treat it early on. Intestinal health is very important for
    many conditions, also neurological conditions...

    Forgot to mention:
    * I did try Viscum/Atropinum and Plumbum => no effect. 
    * Life has been very stressful since Clark's stroke back in April. The
    house is now on the market to sell. Transition. Transitions. 

    What helped:
    * Discontinuation of her frequent acupuncture sessions => helped in hearing
    drops
    * Other posts on the forum about folks with MS => have been helpful too.

    Recent progress after last treatment:
    * Reaction on one of her feet right after treatment => blisters, 
    * Feet less cold => that's good I think as I've been working on
    circulation.

    It is strange, but the link of the page you were referring to leads to the
    homepage. So after that people need to press "Healing aids and practices"
    in the left menu and then "Correct energy flows"

  • 
    SVitale
    July 2015 edited July 2015 Flag
    Yes you are right, if you go to the site and click on Healing Aids subtitle
    'Correct Energy Flows" you will find this :
      □ EarthCalm Resonator Pendant—This
        device was extremely important to my healing because it greatly
        stimulated my life force when I was extremely ill. My life force had
        become stagnant, and the EarthCalm pendant greatly helped to stimulate
        and correct the energy flows in my body. I used the Traditional model,
        which no longer appears to be available.
      □ StarLight and Chiren treatments—These
        are tools used to treat bio-photon incoherency. They are excellent
        tools for correcting “electron spin inversion”. StarLight treatments
        are
        administered by an expert practitioner. Most StarLight practitioners
        recommend the use of the Akaija Pendant to their patients to maintain
        correct energy flows after StarLight treatments.
      □ The BioMat
        is an FDA-approved medical device. The BioMat contains amethyst
        crystals which when heated emit far infrared and negative ions. A
        control panel allows heat to be adjusted between 95 and 158 degrees F.
        The healing effect is very harmonizing with results that are often
        profound and rapid, and as such it is suitable for use with many
        different health problems. The BioMat is not specifically designed to
        protect from EMFs, but it can be extremely beneficial for very quickly
        recovering from EMF exposure. BioMats are considered to be medical
        equipment for pain relief, and also help people who are recovering from
        any kind of radiation treatment. Please phone Holland Franklin at
        800-563-5501 for more information.

    I don't know what is in the EarthCalm pendant, but I do know about the
    BioMat and this has crystals (amethist) in it. 

    Crystals
    Crystals broadcast information that is foreign to the body, and the body
    cannot "choose" as when treated with the Chiren. Energy medicine is also 
    medicine, not every energy is good for everyone and not every dose is good
    for everyone. 

    Sometimes in the skilled hands of someone with extremely good antennas, the
    right crystals can be found combined with the right exposure time so it may
    help someone, but most of the time we see that crystals damage the energy
    field. This is measured as a big disturbance with many steep drops. 

    In practice we are confronted over and over again with clients who believe
    crystals are only beneficial and who damage their auras because of this
    idea. It is something you need to tell clients, that often meets a lot of
    resistance, but I have seen the consequences when people maintained their
    habit of, for example, wearing crystals. Their Hormone System never came
    right and their health continued to deteriorate.

    I have used the EarthCalm pendants and home protection systems since
    developing sensitivity to radiowaves. The inventor claims to have
    programmed something into these products that create a stronger connection
    to the Schumann Resonance and prevent DNA damage from electrosmog. They
    seem to help me stay out of spin inversion, but not sure of the long term
    effects from using these products.

    This is an interesting issue:  so it seems that the chronic exposure, which
    has been lessened by this product, has lessened your sensitivity to EMFs. 
    So one might say that the weakening of the DNA can increase the likelihood
    of spin inversion......??
  •

    July 2015 edited July 2015 Flag
    Spin inversion is caused by strong magnetic fields which this product does
    not protect against. Perhaps, anything that strengthens one's overall
    system makes it less likely one will get spin inversion.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    "anything that strengthens one's overall system makes it less likely one
    will get spin inversion"

    This is definitely true, but take care that strengthening of the system is
    what is actually happening. Sometimes energy pendants/objects/devices cause
    so much stress to the body that apparently they work on relieving symptoms,
    but in fact they are suppressing. Also, if no point or hardly any point
    drops anymore, but this doesn't correlate with the actual physical
    condition you know that there are endorphins created. 
   
    I emphasise this as I have personally witnessed two people develop cancer
    while wearing and working with crystals every day. 
    One of them, a Chiren practitioner, claimed to always feel wonderful and to
    never find spin inversion or drops anymore, and thus the conclusion was
    that crystals were helpful and that there was no need for Chiren
    treatment... 
    The other person thought she had problems with her environment because she 
    always measured spin inversion on herself, but in fact she had a continuous
    aura problem caused by the crystal she was wearing.This crystal was extra
    powerful because it had its original shape. Once the crystal necklace was
    taken off, the drops showed a normal pattern of slight drops and straight
    lines again.

    So I don't say that this EarthCalm pendant is not helpful or even
    problematic perse, but in practice I have seen so many different pendants,
    bracelets and rings that were actually disturbing instead of helping the
    client get better that I believe it is something to be very careful with.
    Johan has exactly the same experience. 
   
    Unfortunately it goes against what many people believe... that is how it is
    in Biontology... experience frequently shows different things than what is
    commonly accepted as truth.
   
   
    Distinguishing Spin Inversion from Aura weakness
    Severe aura problem => ALL points are dropping sharply 
    Spin Inversion => the 6 spin inversion points and possibly more points are
    dropping sharply

    Another good way to distinguish an aura problem caused by an energetically
    active object is to measure with the object, which will give all steep
    drops, and then take the object away. When then the measurement is normal
    again you can be certain that the object was disturbing the aura, but also
    that there was no spin inversion, because a spin inversion will not solve
    instantly.

    I see that in people with R. Arthritis two systems are usually very
    undermined - Kidney and GB. The question is what happened to GB and Ki?  If
    you follow the protocol you will help the body to heal all systems
    effectively. The relief might be immediate (after first session) or it
    might take longer but I have several cases where people are now pain free
    completely.

    Here is the latest email from the client whom I did not see for over the
    year:

     "My hands continue to improve.  On occasion I feel a little arthritis
    pain, but most of the time I am pain-free and forget that I had such a
    problem.  Even better, the three fingers that were most affected have
    gotten better even though I haven't seen you for a while.  The joints are
    still bigger, but my two index fingers are now straight and the middle
    finger on my right hand is not as bent or twisted as when I last saw you.
     Amazing that they have continued improvement.  I rarely feel even the
    slightest pain in the lower part of the bone in my thumb on my left hand or
    stiffness from the swelling on the little finger on my right hand although
    it is still slightly bigger than the little finger on my left hand.  My
    hands feel stronger and I can make a fist although not as firm as before
    and it changes from time to time.  Thank you so much"

He lives really far from me.. in Nebraska.. way out in the countryside.. long
drive to here.. and he is ex-military.. young handsome guy with many issues
since he received all his vaccines .. One major issues was his fatigue. So
driving is too much for him, thus the Chikey.

Symptoms:
Looks healthy, but feels old inside, 
Aches all over inside, 
Osteoporosis, 
Chronic fatigue syndrome

First 2 sessions:
Treated Vaccines, and Heavy Metals - no problems. 

Client was unable to stay for the 3rd session. 
He since then has purchased a Chikey and recently went to his Naturopathic
Doctor who works with a Biomeridian instrument..

Client: "Went to my Naturopathic Doctor today and had a Biomeridian test done.
It showed that I was infected with Acnthamoeba parasites, Epstein Bar Virus,
and Candida. Can you make a remedy card for those?" 

Question:
1. Can anyone give me a suggestion how to respond?
2. How can I make a remedy card for him that would help with this diagnosis? 
3. Can I do this without having completed 3 sessions with him?

Any advice on making a remedy card for this client.. is appreciated!

    A summary of several infections is not a good assessment of what is going
    on in the client's body.
    Although the Biomeridian instrument might be useful, if the therapist
    doesn't know how to implement it in an effective way (deduction to find 
    real causes!) it is only going to distract...
   
    * If the client has Candida, he lacks Intestinal Bacteria, which is
    probably caused by Appendicitis (in any form)
   
    * Epstein Bar Virus might be there, but also then it is a symptom that does
    not cause the Chronic Fatigue.
    I have done research in the 80's on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, when Epstein
    Bar was the new "hype". I treated half of the group of CFS clients with
    Epstein Bar and of the other half I treated their system with the method
    that I now call Biontology. 
    The Epstein Bar group (20 people), did not improve at all, even though the
    Epstein Bar was not measurable anymore. The other group (20 people) was
    completely cured.
    Too much attention is given always to the "bugs", which distracts from the
    true cause. 

    You can create cards. But to address the problem in the right sequence
    there need to be several cards.

    1) 1 for his Adrenals
    2) 1 for the Calcification of his Blood Vessels
    3) 2 for his Appendicitis + Support
    4) 2 for his Intestinal Flora + Support
    5) perhaps one for the Liver

    All card must be used in the right sequence and often enough. The card for
    his Circulation must be used at least 8 weeks, then the Appendicitis card
    for at least 6 weeks. Don't combine these steps. So the first 8 weeks is
    only about the Circulation (card 2).

    The Adrenal card 1 (Selenium + Berberis) should be used as Support for
    every step.

    Recommend also Whiplash and Spin Inversion Treatments.

    Question:
    1. Am I correct for the following instructions to send to my client for the
    Chikey Cards and instructions of use?

    Treat in order:

    1) Support Card => Berberis, Selenium = to be used every step for support

    2) Circulation (Calcification) => Barijodeel, Aurumheel, Aesculus, Circulo,
    Placenta, Atropinum, Hamamelis, Syzygium = used for the first 8 weeks

    After 8 weeks using the Circulation Card....

    3) Chronic Appendicitis  + Tonsillitis => followed by the Support Card =>
     use both at least for 6 weeks

    4) Intestinal Flora + Mucosa => to be followed by Card 1 for Support

    5) Liver => Pfeiffer, Hepar, Hormeel ?? => Once a week?

    Question:
    2. For his complaints with his Spinal Back/Bone pains etc.. Is this OK for
    him to use the following every 3-4 days?

    6) Spine => Discus, Osteoheel, Kalmia Comp, Calcoheel, Arnica = used once a
    week..

    Question:3. For his issues with his Bladder (incontinence, erectile
    dysfunction) He had bladder infection which we did treat successfully - I
    was thinking for support mainly these remedies would assist him.. Is a
    conflict with what you provided me. - would this interfere at all with the
    first group of remedies?
    8) Bladder => Plantago, Solidago, Testis, Hormeel, Saba Homaccord,
    Lymphosot => once a week?  
    for his stress with his health issues, his panic, his worrying, obsessing. 

    9) Emergency Flowers => Rescue Remedy, White Chestnut, Walnut, Crowea, Paw
    Paw, Calm&Clear, Ozaliet

    Thank you much for your feedback!

    Hi Sandra, I recently had a client come in with a medical diagnosis of
    acanthaamoeba parasite in her eyes. She knew something was wrong for about
    3 weeks They did 5 cultures in the hospital to confirm the diagnosis. I
    followed protocol.  5 days after first treatment she went back to Mass Eye
    & Ear Infirmary in Boston and they did another culture. 90% was gone. They
    told patient they didn't know where it went. After 3 treatments she went
    back again for another culture. 100% gone. Follow protocol Trust what you
    measure. Patient was done in 3 sessions

    Great example on how Biontology does not need to focus on every specific
    infection! Thanks Richard.

    However Sandra, remember that the timing of results with the Chikey will
    differ from a Biontology treatment with measurement, the right assessment
    and treatment according to protocol...

    Chikey treatment is less specific and most likely more patience from your
    client (more treatments) is needed. 

    For reasons of trust in Biontology it might be a good idea to share the
    experience of Richard's client. 
    But since your client is going to use a Chikey and is not coming in for
    Biontology treatments again, I think it is important not to set him up with
    expectations that are too high... 

    Try to follow Johan's suggestions, since your extra ideas will set your
    client up for overdosing on Chikey treatments, which will be less
    effective... No more than 1 focussed treatment (on a specific issue/organ
    system) per week should be given, along with the proper support. In the
    middle of the week 1 short program with a few supportive remedies (no
    nosodes!) could be given.

    Johan's comments will follow...

    Answer to question 1
    3) Why do you only want to use Chronic Appendicitis and Tonsillitis on the
    Appendicitis/Tonsillitis card?
    Since you can't measure, the idea is:
    Appendicitis/Tonsillitis card: Appendicitis Necroticans, Chronic
    Appendicitis, Appendicitis, Chronic Tonsillitis, Tonsillitis, Anginheel,
    Tonsilla Compositum, Chelidonium 

    5) Liver card: Zirrhose Hepatis, Hep A, Hep B, Hep A non B, Injeel Chol,
    Hepar, Hepeel, Galium
    Hormeel is not a Liver remedy.....


    Answer to question 2:
    Priorities need to be set, you can't use all these cards at the same time
    and have to have a slow and focussed approach. 

    Bladder remedies can be used for his spinal problems. And you should also
    include Kidney in this treatment. But I would address the Bladder/Kidney
    problems only after the Appendicitis/Tonsilltis cards. 
   
    Erectile dysfunction is not a Bladder problem but a Circulation issue which
    has already been addressed by the "Circulation card".

    I miss Cystopyelonephritis, Cantharis, Populus, and Bact.Proteus on the
    Bladder card you suggest. I would leave Hormeel, Lymphomyosot and Testis
    out.

    I would not use Bush/Bach remedies, and especially not this many, since you
    want to focus the healing energy on the remedies that will really deal with
    the deeper issues.

    One more question on what you wrote in the first reply.

    What are you referring to when you "1" for his Adrenal.. then on point 3
    you say "2" for his Appendicitis.. . are you referring to the session on
    the CHIKEY? 
   
    1) 1 for his Adrenals
    2) 1 for the Calcification of his Blood Vessels
    3) 2 for his Appendicitis + Support
    4) 2 for his Intestinal Flora + Support
    5) perhaps one for the Liver

    This was about how many cards should be created for each step...

    The Appendicitis-card needs a Support card, with supporting Compositae and
    Homaccords.

    For the Intestinal flora card it seems a bit unnecessary to give an extra
    supportive card. In this step you could just use the Adrenal card as an
    extra.

Treating Viruses and Bacteria

Question:
When do we treat Virus/Bacteria in a healthy person?

    To answer your question about treating Bacterial/Viral Infections:

    - Whenever you have a Client coming in you know for sure that he/she is not
    healthy, since there are Symptoms. So in this case you treat what you
    measure according to protocol, and often Infections are part of what you
    measure.

    - When someone is "healthy" usually you won't start to measure, so I'm
    wondering what you mean by this question. 
    I personally only measure myself when I feel really off.... The rest of the
    time my body seems to be able to handle things well and I would like my
    immune system to be as independently functioning as possible...

    - Every Virus/Bacteria can be harmful (even deadly) or completely innocent
    depending on the Overall Condition of the Client. 
    In a weakened body Varicellen can cause Shingles, but many people have it
    in their Systems without having any Symptom from it during their whole
    life. Stressful circumstances (e.g. Radiation, Toxins, Emotional) can cause
    Viruses to surface and create Symptoms.

    I am wondering what different things you have heard in the past. I don't
    think in this case they can be completely wrong, unless you have heard to
    treat yourself every day for example. 
    It might be helpful to everybody who has heard these "different" things in
    the past to read them here with the comments Johan and I give to them to
    make clear as to why something does or doesn't make sense...

    About treating Bacterial infections in healthy people:
    Do we treat them at once, because they have been treated before?
    Do we only treat when feeling very sick (when you feel like going to a
    doctor)?

    And then about Viral infections:
    Varicellen can be very painful for children, so I'm wondering if this would
    be OK to treat at once.
    My children had Varicellen 2 years ago. I measured them all when spots
    appeared on one of them (the others had the virus but not the spots). They
    all developed Chickenpox with all symptoms although they had no drops
    before this.
     
    Now I have found there's so much Dioxin in food and water where I live, I
    do treat the food with Airborne Toxins...
    And I will be treating myself with it too, when I'm eating out (restaurant,
    friends etc.).

    Question:
    1. Would it be OK to treat Chicken products for Salmonella, since this too
    is a very big problem here?

    Sometimes my kids eat at their friends homes and feel unwell because of
    eating eggs. I don't wait until they vomit or have diarrhea, but treat
    right away. I now suspect it is not only Salmonella but also Dioxin.
    2. I don't know when to treat straight away and when to wait.... can you
    give me advice on this?


  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    May 2013 edited May 2013 Flag
    You can treat Bacterial Infections always immediately, the moment you
    notice and measure them. 
    Waiting until you have a full blown Infection with severe symptoms is not a
    good idea, because then the Light treatment is often not enough to get
    better right away. It will take longer for the body to win the fight.... 

    Don't measure yourself every day though... because every slight infection
    will create a drop, but this will disappear within 24 hours if you have a
    functioning immune system..
    Try only to measure when you feel something is not right, so you can leave
    the less severe infections to exercise your immune system. Ultimately
    Freedom means being healthy enough to not need the Chiren anymore ;-)

    The same applies for the Viruses. You can treat them immediately.
    But if you encounter Chickenpox or Shingles again, keep in mind that
    Variolinum works much better for this than Varicellen.

    1. You can treat Chicken products with Salmonella in a short program as
    described by Johan.

    2. See comments above, treating right away before symptoms explode is best.

    Thank you for the good answer. This also clears up another misunderstanding
    that I had. 

    The Chiren doesn't kill the Bacteria... it helps the Immune System to take
    on the fight instead of doing the fight for it. 
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    Yes, completely true. The Chiren doesn't kill the Bacteria, but changes the
    energy of both our Body and the Bacteria in a way that the Body can Heal
    itself again.

    For children of 10 years old you can use the 2-7 Program. I don't use the
    Footplate treatment for them.

    There's no danger in using the Footplate/Dyslexia Program like in the Adult
    Protocol, but children may not like to sit still for such a long time and
    it is not really necessary.

    If your really need additional remedies you can use another 2-7 Program.

    Some additional information to prevent giving an overdose of remedies to
    children:

    Children can handle much less information and detox, so you should really
    look for the real cause. And use as little remedies as possible.

    The footplate treatment in itself is not dangerous for a child and wouldn't
    bring in "more information" of a same remedy. So this is why it can be used
    safely for children too. But the danger is to give too many remedies. You
    always have to be very careful with children not to overdose on remedies.
    So if you (or the child) really want to use the footplate treatment, use it
    empty or almost empty.

    I hardly ever use more than one hand treatment and if really more remedies
    are needed I leave most slots empty in the second hand treatment.

    The footplate treatment is not necessary for children. The short hand

    When a child really wants to copy an adult treatment and wants the

Bloodworms in Horses

liselottewliselottew
January 2013 edited January 2013 in Animals Flag
We have treated horses in our stable for parasites with water that was treated
with remedies: Tuberculinum and Nux Vomica for 6 weeks. 

We did a fecal parasite test before and after. All types of worms that are
harmful had left the horses after treatment, except for the bloodworms. The
latin name of this worm is Sanguis Larva

My question is: what can be the reason for this typical worm not reacting on
the treatment? 

One of the horses very easily gets colics. I've treated it for a while. There
are almost no more drops when I surrogate measured and everything sounds good,
but still the horse can only eat little portions every hour. If the horse eats
too much it gets constipated and gets colic. Now the veterinarian found blood
worms in the large intestines. 

I've treated this horse with: Diverculose for a longer time. He also had a lump
on the outside of the stomach. But this is almost gone now. I don't measure
Diverticulose any longer. I've neutralized Blood Worms today. Any ideas?

    Hi Lise-Lotte,
    I think you are doing a great job with the horses. I am not a horse
    specialist so I am hoping anyone else with more experience with horses
    would comment on this case.

    Anyway, from your case I would suggest if you can do a whiplash on the
    horse again?

    Hi Liselotte,

    Since it is the larvae stage of the bloodworm that is found in the feces
    and the other species of worms did disappear after treatment, is it
    possible that the horses were reinfected? 

    Maybe the horses should be moved to another place were the living
    environment can be cleaned frequently from feces  (the eggs and larvae are
    ingested as part of the lifecycle of the worm) and they are only fed on a
    controlled food source that is hygienic. And then of course keep treating
    the horses like you did.

    This is just a suggestion, since like Nora I've personally no experience
    with treating horses.

    Hi Liselotte.

    I have treated some horses but never with bloodworms. What Karolina
    suggested is a very good idea, that needs to be tested if the horse is not
    getting the bloodworms out, or back in again.

    I dont know if you did but I would treat him/her with the glass rods on the
    front legs, wrap it with a strecher or somthing else that holds the rods.
    But Tuberculinum and Nux Vomica there. Also check for Dioxin, Salmonella
    Typhi, Copper or other heavy metals that can be found in the bites. What
    kind of food source do they have? Dry hey, sour hey, korn or...? Have you
    treated with all the vaccinations?

    This is a very good idea from Karolina. This is somthing that needs to be
    tested just to be sure. And a Whiplash :)

    The owner gives here horses soups. Primero total in water (special feed
    that has no hard grain, only oils and different gras types). The horse gets
    dry hay every half hour. Only small bites to prevent constipation. 

    The horse needs to be ridden every day, lightly, for the same reason
    (constipation). 

    Bites - do you mean test the food? 

    Yes i have treated for vaccinations, there are almost no drops anymore.
    There haven't been any drops for a while.
    I will try that out, thank you, the boxes are cleaned every day, but not
    the horses yard I think. It's very cold (freezing) in Sweden however, so I
    do not think the worms survive outside. The horses have been treated with
    regular medicine for worms every 6 months. 
   
    How often should I give the treated water?

    This horse where brought to the vet by owner for worm treatments, got out a

    normal.

    Now the horse has been good for a longer period, so then it would a been a
    case before of not getting the worms out I guess? Is there any reason why
    the horse should not get the worms out by the treated water for 6 weeks?
    Water treated with Tuberculinum and Nux Vomica. Will have the horse for
    measurements again soon to measure him. Will update after.

    The horse has visable scars on front leg. Do I treat that with patches or
    glas rodes? Because the patches would be full of hair after. I would have
    to hold them up to make them stick to the leg i think. Just to get the
    meridian unblocked. Not cosmetic treatment.

    You can just treat with the glass rods, they are effective in unblocking
    the scars. The difference between glass rods and metal wires for scar
    treatment seems to be in cosmetic improvement of the scars, which is bigger

Client's Questions About Other Therapies

Irina
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Other Therapies & Instruments Flag
Client: 74 year old man with history of Kidney Stones.We got to the point that
he doesn't need any more treatments. He feels very good and his urologist
dismissed him.
My concern for him that he is very obsessed with the supplements (takes about
25 different things) and different "health" therapies.

His Questions:
1. He takes Chelation therapy once every three months in the form of IV with
the active element Phosphatidylcholine with the purpose to keep the arteries
"clean".
2. Every three months he takes an enema with coffee in the solution and small
capfull of H2O2.

Would you please comment on these practices.I already told him that everything
that avoid digestion tract is a poison for the body.

    I think that you should tell him too trust his own Immune System. If he
    doesn't do that, he will shop around for ever.

    Agree with you Peter. 
    Focus gets lost and he might spinn into what works and what doesn't :) Like
    a marry-go-round, it sounds to me. 
    Several clients do this and I have bern there too.. Nobody suggested me to
    stop this mad activity...

    By the way, do you know where I can read about he filter system / Dyslexia
    and Programs Chiren. I wonder when to use what Filtered? I have several
    thoughts about this regarding the strenght of the matches when we measure.

    For some reason I have not been aware of non filter Dyslexia Program. Beate

    Yes, I agree. I think the fear of not being able to stay well, not trusting
    own body definitely has reflection on his kidneys.
    I could only suggest..., but everyone is responsible for their choices.

    The chelation is probably mainly used to treat atherosclerosis? It takes an
    awful long time to get the arteries clean. Of course Kidney stones are also
    a result of malfunctioning Calcium metabolism too.

    With the Chiren you can do the same thing and a lot faster. Once the
    patients system is up and going there is no need for the Chelation
    anymore. 

    The many supplements do not help his Kidneys, they will do the opposite.
    Did you ever ask him why he takes these supplements?

Scar Treatment - Optical vs Electrical Wires

kathrynhowardkathrynhoward
June 2015 edited June 2015 in Therapy Questions Flag
Johan - I've been using the scar treatments with miraculous results above my
mouth area, as you know. I suddenly had a thought. I remember you telling me,
and reading, that photons only travel through fiber optic cables. However, the
cables/wires that go with the scar treatment in the Chiren (the orange ones
I have been using) - are not fiber optic from what I can see. So, how do the
photons get through that in the scar treatment without the fiber optic cable?
Thank you... Very curious.

    Information can also travel on electrical currents. 

    The current that goes through the electrical cables is the electricity that
    the body naturally generates. So when the electrical wires are used, (bio)
    photons are not involved.
  • 
    kathrynhowardkathrynhoward
    June 2015 Flag

    Hmmm... Sorry. So, when the scar treatment is running, there are no photons
    involved with working on the scars? What is it that transforms the scars to
    such an extent then? ONLY electricity and whatever the scar treatment is?

    The body does not only communicate with light, it also communicates with
    electricity. 
    The electrical system works with the body's own electricity just like the
    optical system works with the body's own light. 
    Information can be modulated both on electricity and light, but electricity
    only carries information that matches the lower end of the spectrum whereas
    light caries information that matches on all frequencies.

    When we treat the physical scars on the first appointment do we always use
    electrical cables or do it with the glass rods?
    I understand that for physical improvement of the look of the scar the
    electrical cords need to be used for future treatments. But when we just
    care to take off energy blockage on biophoton highways?
    Thank you!
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    June 2015 edited June 2015 Flag
    Either choice is fine if you just want to take care of the energy blockage.
    Personally I prefer to treat the smaller scars with the electrical system
    since it is often impossible to position the rods in a way that they don't
    touch and at the same time do touch the scar tissue on both sides... 

    Big scars like C-sections I prefer to treat with the rods because it is
    faster than the patches (the rods are always within reach). I do ask if
    people are interested in more cosmetic improvement, and if they do, of
    course I use the patches then...

    Irina
    June 2015 edited June 2015 Flag
    So, just to summarize...

    1. All physical scars can be treated by electric patches or by glass rods.
    2. Either way will remove energy blockages.
    3. Electric patches need to be no more than 7 cm apart, while the glass
    rods can be at any distance? Any?
    4. When we treat for local pain (due to injury) using whiplash program
    glass rods have to touch the skin. Is this correct?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    June 2015 Flag
    1. Correct
    2. Correct
    3. Not correct. 
     If you treat physical scars with the light rods they also need to be no
    more than 7 cm apart. Only when you treat an energetic disturbance that is
    not connected to a physical scar, like whiplash or an aura hole, you can
    hold the rods further apart.
    4. Correct.
     Whiplash can also be treated through cloth, but if there is a physical
    component to the local pain, like a bruise or wound that you want to treat,
    it is best to treat it on the skin and to touch a part of healthy skin and
    a part of the affected area while treating.

    there's so many things that have to be done apart from that it takes more

    Hi Johan. Thanks for the new measurement protocol. I have a question
    regarding step 9. I often find, that if there is a problem with
    appendicitis Nekro. or chronic, it corrects also most drop in circulation.
    Is it wrong to put them in first, and then corrects circulation afterwards

    February 2013 edited March 2013 Flag
    Hello Karolina,


    'It is perfectly Ok', but is this what you and Johan would do or do you
    follow the new protocol?
    I was also a little bit confused because I was on the assumption that
    problems with the appendix were more 'important' than drops on circulation?

    I'am very happy with the new measurement protocol, and the measuring 
    points on the pictures are the ones we have to measure from now on?
  • 
    janjan
    February 2013 Flag
    Yes, I too wonder as Renata, why the heart and nervous system are not
    included?
     Also the measurement for Nux and Hamamelis on the nail point
    (hemorroids)... is that correct, I have not thought to measure those there,
    and if correct will do so.  In the new protocol it is #4 on LI. Is this
    because of the pressure causing the hemorroids and hamamelis will relieve
    that pressure along with the other corrections? 
    Thank you.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    February 2013 Flag
    The new treatment protocol is a guideline and represents the way Johan in
    practice "builds" his treatments.
   
    However if you gain more insight you can of course play with it a little.
    It is important to understand though which parts are crucial, like always
    measuring everything before you do any treatment so you can make a clear
    assessment (without masking anything) and cleaning the hormonal system
    first. The remedies given are positioned in the order that they occur most
    likely...
   
    The drops on the Appendix are very important since Chronic(Necrotic) and
    Acute Appendicitis can cause a lot of problems all over the body, including
    the Circulation.

    When I wrote the protocol, Johan decided that giving the Circulation
    priority is important, because of its connection to the Soul and its
    presence in every single part of the body... However to fix the Circulation
    first, is one of the more flexible parts of the protocol. And of course the
    Appendicitises will often correct points on the Circulation too, so you
    could try these remedies too if others don't work and in that way you can
    find these remedies without first measuring the Appendix Point.

    The measurement protocol, is going to be sufficient in most of the clients
    and sessions. But of course there are also those cases where you need a
    different approach and need to change the order of some of the points.
    Biontology is far more then following these steps, but it is a great help.

    Heart and Nervous System are included, but not mentioned as such. After the
    Yang Organs, you go to the Yin Organs and Other Organs. 
   
   
    And now I see that the protocol that is send around is not complete.... I
    did include Heart and Nervous System on the remedy pages..... I have to
    look for that on my old laptop I'm sorry. If I find the complete protocol
    I'll send it.... if I don't I have to rewrite them.
   
    Thanks Jan and Renate for paying attention to the details, although Heart
    and Nervous System are far more than just some details of course..... ;-)
   
    The Nail Point on the left hand side on the Large Intestine meridian is the
    Anal point where you can measure Hemorrhoids. The indication for this is
    measuring that Hamamelis or Nux Vomica fix on that point. Hemorrhoids are
    actually varicose veins in the anus and both remedies are indicated for
    this.
  • 
    janjan
    February 2013 Flag
     Glad to know the heart and nervous system matter!  ;-)
    Re: Nux and Hamamelis...I will remember that as I had not known it, It was
    not in anything I previous had seen or taken notes on.
     Yes, on the anal point (  Iam quite familiar with it as hemorroids seem so
    common, and especally familiar now from the fireman I am treating who is
    doing so well now) I used periproptic abcess and supported with Mysterica,
    and it cleared a number of the intestine points.
     Previously I thought if periproptic abcess matched it was hemorroids. Now
    if I understand this farther...Periprotic abcess is the nosode supported by
    either nux or Hamamelis. I am glad to have more in the arsenal!
    Thank you.
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    February 2013 Flag
    On the anal point you measure either Periproctic Abcess or Nux Vomica /
    Hamamelis. The remedy Periproctic Abcess is needed for a different
    condition than Hemorrhoids. It is used when there's anal damage from
    enema's or other causes that have created an inflammation with or without
    an abcess.

    Hemorrhoids are varicose veins and there's usually no inflammation that
    accompanies them, so the remedy won't match. For this issue you need to
    restore the strength of the veins with Hamamelis and/or Nux Vomica, but
    more important is to treat the cause which is too much pressure due to for
    example constipation.

    I understand that we are to clear both TW before moving on to other
    meridians. If that is the case, should we clear both insulin points by
    testing for the cause, such as various GB remedies, duodenitis, etc. on the
    insulin points, before moving on to the other meridians? (This is assuming
    the insulin points don't automatically go up when the other TW points are
    fixed). Thanks.

    I want to make sure I understood it correctly:
    1.After measuring and correcting, if needed, whiplash and/or Spin inversion
    ,
    2. - I measure ALL points starting on the left SI with no remedies in slots
    . JUST TO have and Complete PICTURE.
    3. Then I correct TW drops and LEAVE remedies in slots
    4. Correct  Kidney's drops
    5. Correct Circulation drops
    6. Correct SI and LI drops (in correlation with Lungs and Lymph)
    7. GB
    8. Stomach
    9. then KI and BL again

    I found that it is time saving to check on App.point first (after TW)
    because it might correct so many points.
    Also, on Circulation I check for Barjodeel/ Aurumheel/Atropinum and if that
    does not work I go to GB/Kidney/Heart, and check if remedies will work on
    Circulation too (often I remove Atropinum to see if something else is
    needed as priority).  Is that wrong?

    Hand treatment.

    1. Measure again with NO REMEDIES? or I can put remedies as I go along?
    2. Correct  Hormonal, Circulation and Kidney

    Footplate treatment or another 2-7 program for children

    1. Measure again
    2, correct TW and Kidney systems if needed and give remedy/s in 2-7 program
    End of session

    Hi Yelyena

    * You completely understand how you can make connections and how organs
    influence each other, this is a good way of finding those remedies that
    correct the most drops. So there's no problem in this, it is exactly what
    you should do. Like the protocol says... after point 9... or better,
    starting with point 9 you can be more flexible in the order of addressing
    issues according to insight. The way you describe it, is how it is done.

    The protocol however gives a guideline to help you keep in mind what is the
    proper order of addressing issues. The Yang Organs and Circulation are very
    important to treat first so the body will be able to detox first. Only
     then the healing of deeper (Yin) issues can start. Measuring for a "Large
    Intestine remedy" like Appendicitis Necroticans on the Circulation doesn't
    mean that you don't address the Circulation first... you still are
    addressing it, but you know how to cross measure to find the reason for
    circulatory problems and in this case you find it in the Large Intestines. 
    So you still are searching to correct the Circulation first, but you do so
    by also treating the Appendix (hope this makes sense...). 

    * After the hand treatment you measure everything without remedies so again
    you won't miss any information. Same procedure again.... Get the general
    picture of how the condition is after the Hand Treatment and then start to
    find the remedies that correct the imbalances, that is if at that point
    there still are drops...

    * The last step is there to secure that at least the Triple Warmer and
    Kidneys are corrected at the end of the session. However if you've measured
    right and have found the core remedies needed this should hardly ever be
    necessary.

Question:
I have found several remedies in the Chiren that are not explained in the

    Hello Dolores, 

    The first one I've erased since that is not a remedy that is standard in
    the Chiren or added by Johan himself. Sometimes cards go around and are
    exchanged during the courses that are not ours.

    Centaury and Cerato are Bach flower-remedies. I think the descriptions
    should be in the manual, but if they're not, a lot of information is easily
    found on the internet about them.
    http://www.bachflower.org/centaury.htm
    http://www.bachflower.org/cerato.htm

    DEN Kombi and IGM Kombi are experiments created by Johan in the past. 

    DEN Kombi is the combination of the remedies - Paradontose, Granuloma Denti
    and Kieferostitis
    IGM Kombi is the combination of most of the food-bacteria (the information
    which ones is lost)

    However these experiments were not very effective and it has shown many
    times that recipes just don't work as well as testing for the specific
    bacteria that causes an infection. The more specific the information is
    that is given to the body the better the reaction of the body usually is.

    Hi Kathryn,

    Two times the same remedy is not going to give more strength to what is
    given so there's no reason to be worried about overkill. However it is a
    waste of your slot. It is always best to try to measure for as little
    remedies as possible to balance everything. The DEN combi is less specific
    than just the Kieferostitis and if this is the remedy that balances the jaw
    point on the Stomach meridian you just have to use that. The DEN combi was
    an experiment that failed.

    I forgot to answer the question about the tooth chart. This is put in the
    manual to give insight into interrelationships in the body and of course it
    is interesting to use.

    But I must admit I've never used it myself. The chart shows however how
    influential the teeth are in organ health. Oral health is very important
    and when there are ongoing serious problems of teeth/jaw the body can not
    recover fully before they are gone.

Hereditary Multiple Osteochondroma

    Hi Kathryn,

    Biontology has a holistic approach and a medical diagnosis is not very
    helpful to find out what is needed. Even within a hereditary disease like
    this every patients has different symptoms or at least a different
    seriousness of the complaints.

    Can you tell more about the symptoms she is suffering from and how serious
    those symptoms are. Where they are experienced in her body etc.

    Most diseases that have a genetic "predisposition" are very much influenced
    by environment and lifestyle. These diseases you can easily turn around.
    Even though the genes might create a weakness, that doesn't necessarily
    mean that one has to become ill. That there are factors that can aggravate
    or initiate the disease means that other factors, like the Chiren, can
    improve the condition or stop the disease too. 

    However there are more rare genetic diseases that almost always come to
    expression if the right... or rather wrong.. gene is present, I don't know
    how these are going to react on the Chiren. I think the prognosis might get
    better if you keep treating regularly, but completely turning it around...
    I don't know . 

    Do you know if this "hereditary" disease is connected to a gene that almost
    always comes to expression? So that if you would have this gene it would
    mean that you automatically have the disease? 


    However even if you're not sure that treating her it is going to work, I
    would always try! Everybody who reacts on the treatment feels better one
    way or another. It is just not easy to predict to what extend things can be
    stopped or turned around.... But we actually can never make predictions
    like that.

    With more details I think Johan will answer you on what you have to focus
    on....

    Nobody in this family knows of anyone who ever had this before, but it is
    considered a genetic disease:

     "previously called hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), is characterized
    by growths of multiple osteochondromas (benign cartilage-capped bone tumors
    that grow outward from the metaphyses of long bones). Osteochondromas can
    be associated with a reduction in skeletal growth, bony deformity,
    restricted joint motion, shortened stature, premature osteoarthrosis, and
    compression of peripheral nerves." 

    This adorable little girl is suffering so much from the pain of the bones
    growing incorrectly and the tumors that are pressing on the nerves. They
    have already started to "shave the areas" to lessen the pain...but there is
    nothing that seems to be useful in healing it. I will send her some of what
    you wrote. I told her I didn't know... but IF Johan thinks the Chiren could
    help with anything, does he have someone he can recommend in the CT/NY
    area? This is a case for someone who is very experienced and also knows
    something about medical issues on some level, I would think (?). Seems 1 in
    100,000 in Europe have this, and 1 in 50,000 here. Thank you. Kathryn

    Have you already measured and treated her?

    I would like to see what you measure.

    For hereditary problems you first have to look at the hormonal system. Are
    there specific areas where the bones have spurs, look at what meridians are
    running there.

    I'd like to follow up after you have measurements. We have no experience
    with this disease, so it is best to follow the normal procedure...

Treatment Frequency & Low Measurement Sounds

February 2013 edited February 2014 in Measurement Flag
New Client:
Man diagnosed Multiple Myeloma. Wants to try Biophoton Therapy, before
Chemotherapy (planned for early March)

History:
Chemo (couple of years ago) => now the disease is active again. 

Questions:

1. Does anyone have experience with Multiple Myeloma?

2.  I would like to reach to treat three times before, there must be a new
blood test early March. 
Is it ok to treat on 15.2, d.19.2 and d. 22.2, because I can not treat in week
9? 
I know there is a little too short break between the second and third
treatment, but if he "tolerates" the treatment well, is it then ok?

    * The rest time between two treatments should at least be 3 days, so 19.2 a
    treatment and 22.2 the next is not enough.

    * Also between a treatment and a blood test there should always be at least
    5 days, because otherwise the blood will be full of toxins and other values
    will be unreliable too, since the body is healing and detoxifying after a
    session.

    Measurement trouble!
   
    I had my multiple myeloma client yesterday afternoon, and I had to give up
    treating him. When I measured, there was only a low low humming. 
   
    Actions:
    Whiplash Treatment + Spin Inversion Treatment with blood => still humming. 
    Energy Remedies and Preparation Treatment => still humming
    Gallbladder remedies and Plumbum, Viscum, Causticum and Placenta => sound
    was little better, but still not good enough to measure

    Question:
    This is the first time, that I could not get the sound up, so I could
    measure. What could I have done?

    Clarification please:
    Are you saying to wait 5 days after having blood drawn for a test?  Like a
    CBC or lab test where they simply draw a tube or several for tests?  

    Some of our clients are having tests frequently, and so we would interrupt
    the one week space between treatments after a blood test, or adjust our
    schedule so the test was done just after our treatment? 

    Thanks, just want to make sure I understand it correctly.

    Hi Jan: It is the other way around. 

    You have to wait 5 days after the Biophoton therapy before you can do a
    blood test that shows relatively "reliable" values. The treatment will
    cause many toxins to be released in the blood and immune activity to be
    higher. This means white blood cell count will be higher too.

    Question:
    What can you suggest about the low humming sounds? 
    I've had the same experience yesterday with my client. 
    She is "always doing fine", although she just lost her husband a year ago
    => Can suppression also be a reason for the low humming sounds?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    February 2013 edited February 2014 Flag
    Very dry skin accompanied by static electricity can cause low humming
    sounds. You can use an anti-static mat on the floor. Clothes can be part of
    this too (synthetic clothes can cause staticity).

    If it is dryness of the hands you have to work on Circulation and Energy.

    I did try to improve Circulation and Energy.
    I've worked in the same location all day without problems.
    I've had the low sounds before with Chemo-clients, but I always managed
    to successfully get the sound up.

    I did worked on Circulation of my client but not really on her energy. She
    always looks like a human skippy-ball but her Adrenal gland did respond to
    Selenium. 

    I will see her next Saturday and if there are still humming sounds I will
    try the energy remedies and an anti-static mat (we already use a sheepskin
    on the ground for a nice and comfortable feeling on their bare feet) 

    She came to me in the first place because of her trip to Indonesia and she
    wanted to get rid of the influence of Radiation on the plane and
    Vaccination for Yellow Fever. 

    She is always doing fine and more concerned about other people than
    herself. Is it possible that someone can put such a strong mask
    (unconsciously) on themselves, that there is some difficulty to communicate
    with the body?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    February 2013 edited February 2014 Flag
    The reason why she is such a skippy-ball is that she lives on nervous
    energy, on will power.
    Her Adrenals were probably already exhausted a long time ago.

    It is very likely that she's wearing a mask. Many people who don't respect
    their own boundaries are pleasers and behave in a manner that they think
    people expect from them. and they put on a different mask in all different
    situations. They find it hard to say no.

    This style of living creates an enormous amount of stress and takes a lot
    of energy.
   
    However putting on a mask doesn't create low humming sounds, low
    circulatory energy does...
  •

    When there are still all humming sounds to begin with, is it allright to
    start with energie-remedies with for example the programm 2-7? I will not
    put a mask over the measuring?

    Thanks for your answer, she fits in that picture.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    February 2013 edited February 2014 Flag
    The danger of masking things is always there if you run a program with
    remedies before you measure. 

    The energy-remedies are compositae and have many different components in
    them that can act on many systems. But if you can't measure to begin with,
    everything is already "masked" in a way.... And then you don't have
    anything to work with except for the symptoms. 

    If there is a way to be able to measure even though some of the drops will
    be masked this is the best you can do I think... I wouldn't fill all the
    slots though and be careful what to pick. 
   
    Also remember that sometimes people forget they shouldn't put hand cream on
    when they come for treatment. This will guarantee low sounds and unreliable
    measurements!

Nauseous by Pregnancy

March 2013 edited January 2014 in Symptoms Flag

Hi , in the past I have had many people with the question if we can treat
Nausea by pregnancy and know that for some it worked a bit to treat the
Gallbladder.

I'm 9 weeks pregnant and feel nonstop sick and nauseous! I've treated my
Gallbladder a lot (also for my slipped disks) but no luck. on the footplates I
put Nux Vomica and Vomitusheel is there anything else I could do to stop this? 

(I still work with the Starlight) many thanks warm regards, Anouk

    Hi Anouk, 

    I'd like to hear your follow up feedback if the additional remedies:
    Anacardium, Gastritis, Cocculus, and Psorinum helped with nausea.

    I'm still learning how & why different remedies are used, so I'm curious as
    to WHY Psorinum has been recommended here.

    I was once told this kind of nausea was caused when there are "too many
    hormones" in the stomach due to the pregnancy. I don't know if this is true
    or what specific hormones are being produced to create this symptom.

    thank you so much for your reactions, 

    A couple of days ago I treated myself with: Anacardium, Gastritis,
    Cocculus, Psorium, Vomitusheel and Nux Vomica

    The day after I did start to feel better....I'm still slightly better than
    before this treatment so I guess I will do this one more often.


    Why Psorium? Good question, I would not have thought of that nosode myself
    in this case... could you explain that one?

    With my first pregnancy I also did a lot of different treatments on myself
    the first 3 months and don't think the Starlight can do any harm, I was
    told if a woman is pregnant she dumps all the bad stuff in the baby so
    keeping it all clean and check regular bacteria must be very good .... (I
    felt good though)

    Psorinum is a Homeopathic Remedy that reacts mostly on:

    Skin problems,
    Astma related problems 
    Stomach problems (hungry all the time, but nauseous)
    It is for people who are usaly cold and is also a great remedy for pregancy
    nausea !! 

    You can find this information in the Materia Medica of Homeopathy !

Acid Reflux Coughs

megan_wick
May 2013 edited January 2014 in Symptoms Flag
I know a man that went to his doctor after having a severe cough and loosing
his voice the last four months.  The doctor diagnosed that it was acid reflux
coughs.  Even though this man never gets heartburn or physically feeling the
acid reflux, this is what the doctor said was the cause.  What are your
thoughts on this?  His wife asked me if it was treatable with the Chiren and
what it might be from and i didn't quite know how to answer since I've never
come across this before.

Thanks!

    Yes, this is possible and I have seen it before. When this is the case
    you'll find Gallbladder issues and Stress affecting the Stomach.... 

    As Yelyena I'm looking forward to more information about this case. Right
    now it is only guessing what is going on... It might or might not be caused
    by acid reflux...

    Correction for everyone who has read the previous comment that I've just
    removed:

    Acid Reflux is NOT always caused by Whiplash... I don't know where this
    idea originated, but it is true that SOMETIMES Whiplash can cause Acid
    Reflux. You will be able to measure this though.

    When you measure Whiplash and then all drops on Gallbladder and Stomach
    resolve, you'll know that the acid reflux was caused by this.

    In case of Acid Reflux, there's always a problem with Gallbladder and
    Stomach, however this can have many Causes, one of the possible causes is
    Whiplash.....

lot of fear about this.

2. She informed me that in the height of the disease she experienced pus field
blisters on her body, would this suggest many toxins in her body? 
Is this the course then to take?

    Answers:
    1. In the first place her Kidneys are dropping, and they were not
    addressed...

    You should have looked for the matching nosode(s) and also used all Kidney
    Support available together with Lymphomyosot. 
    When the Kidneys are blocked and can't eliminate Toxins anymore, the Skin
    gets affected since the body uses it as a secondary elimination channel.
    So as the body tried to eliminate Toxins after the treatment, but the
    Kidneys were out of order, her symptoms aggravated. 

    2. The pus blisters are caused by Infections, Toxins do not generate
    Blisters that are filled with Pus.
   
    Appendicitis causes Bacteria to go all over the body and could cause tissue
    pains because of the Intestinal Flora being all over the place.

    I would focus on the Kidneys and  Intestines, and also use the Intestinal
    bacteria immediately. 
    The Large Intestine might not be able to take them back as yet but because
    of the double working of these nosodes, they might be able to clear a lot
    of Infections. 

    I would not worry about the other points at this time.

    I believe Lupus is Intestinal problem.

    I have a client and asked her to stop taking bread and sugar, treated her
    and after a few weeks the pain and the infections were gone! 
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel

    Hello Judith:

    Based on your experience it shows Lupus (if the diagnosis was right..) for
    your client caused Intestinal dysfunction, or the other way around. 
    Intestinal problems have caused a heightened sensitivity to sugar and
    bread, probably leading to more problems that went away when she stopped
    eating them….

    So now the question is what is the Cause behind the Intestinal Sensitivity
    to wheat and sugar (not everyone reacts this way!). What did you find on
    the Intestines?

    If the symptoms were pain and infections, the diagnosis might also have
    been wrong. It might for example have been celiac disease, which is usually
    caused by food poisonings. Then the approach of stopping glutentemporarily
    makes sense.

    Maybe you removed the underlying Cause already, but you will only know if
    the symptoms stay away when she starts eating sugar and bread again. This
    is the only way to know if the disease is really gone.

    Something to be aware of…..

    Thanx Johan and karolina, 
    I´m still working with her, wil get back to you if I find the cause I'm
    with you when you say there must be something more behind this, the doctors
    unfortunately give her strong medication against the infections and
    unfortunately she is too afraid to stop that, but I was surprised the see
    what happens with the body when the infections stay away and if that's
    because of the different food you can dig deeper to find the cause,
    otherwise you're treating the same infection over again with no result. 

    In Holland there is a big change now in looking at food, people are more
    and more certain that what we eat is poisoning ourselves with sugar and
    other e numbers and colored stuff.

    This is great news. I have a friend with Vitiligo who has been asking about
    getting treated.

    Questions:
    1. Did you need to repeat any of the vaccination neutralizations more than
    once?
    2. How many treatments did it take to bring color the back?
    3. Did the vaccination removal alone do the trick or were there any other
    symptoms or other meridians involved?
    4. Has her skin completely recovered?
    5. Did you run any specific supports with this?

    Hi Yelyena,

    It is interesting because your client has two seemingly opposite symptoms;
    over pigmentation of the skin + depigmentation of the skin

    Can you give more information about symptoms, history and measurements of
    your client?

    Vitiligo and melasma are general diagnoses, but I like to know more
    specific what the light and dark patches on the skin look like, where they
    are located, when they did appear (e.g. did it all show up at once, or were
    there first dark spots?), whether there are other symptoms that appeared at
    the same time as the skin issues etc.

    It is true that the Hormonal System is involved in both Vitiligo and
    Melasma, but it is not only the Pineal that is causal. Correcting the
    Triple Warmer is however the most important thing in these conditions.


    Hi Christina,

    Some reflection (in order to help with the "how to think" part Johan is
    looking for in case studies):

    * Where did the idea come from that the Pineal is THE cause of Vitiligo?
    Most likely many more points were dropping for this client....
    I do know that in the alternative medical field this is an assumption. But
    this is solely based on the improvement of vitiligo by taking melatonin,
    which is produced by the Pineal. It is just not enough information to base
    a conclusion like this on. Melatonin is a very strong anti-oxidant, and
    might very well just counteract oxidative stress caused by a different
    causal factor....

    * When you work according to protocol, it is impossible to get away with
    only using the "vaccinations". More remedies were needed to correct the
    dropping points on the different Organ Systems for sure. And then there is
    the use of the "broad spectrum" support remedies. So the improvements can
    hardly be projected on the Pineal or the "Vaccinations" alone. At least not
    without explanation, your overall assessment first has to make sense.

    * Vitiligo (discolouration of the skin) is a symptom, which like any
    symptom can have a variety of causes.
    Don't forget Yelyena's client has 3 symptoms! Alopecia, Melasma (hyper
    pigmentation of the skin) and Vitiligo.
    To make a Biontology assessment, to find the real cause, it is important to
    see the connection between all symptoms and the measurements.
    I miss all of this in your explanation of what you believe to be the cause
    of the symptom Vitiligo.

    * Another thing is that we don't "neutralise vaccinations" so much. I know
    this is used as a matter of speech, but what we actually do is to give the
    body the opposite information of the childhood diseases themselves that are
    in the vaccinations. Only Anti-Tetanus is information of a true
    vaccination.

    * I hope you can provide more information about your measurements, and
    about what Organ Systems were dropping and how they reacted on what
    remedies.
    Otherwise the information to come to a proper assessment (and this is what
    Johan likes to see in the case studies too!) will be lost.

    * All this being said, the Hormonal System truly is the main system to
    balance in order to help with vitiligo, but it is not just the Pineal.


    Hi Dennis,

    1. Whenever "vaccinations" are measured a second time, something is going
    on in either the treatment (e.g. overdosing by running too many nosodes or
    more than 16 remedies in total) or in the client (e.g. he/she gets into
    Spin Inversion right after treatment so the healing stops).

    2. There is no recipe for any disease or symptom, so knowing how fast a
    client has reacted does not tell anything for the future. The symptom is
    not what determines the number of treatments needed. The ability of the
    client to react to treatment is one factor. And another is the right
    assessment/treatment, which will be different for every client. Environment
    and lifestyle are important too....

    3. Very good question! Other meridians must have been involved too. See
    other comments.

    4 & 5 I agree that it would be very nice to have the one solution/recipe
    that is completely effective. But the results for Christina's client have
    to do with so many factors, that are personal and case related. Results
    can't be copied.

    Comment:
    Looking back I know that it was premature to give Barijodeel and Aurumheel
    before Parathyroid point sounds clear and also all Nosodes should be left
    to do for another session in Program 1.

    2nd Session:

    Feedback from the client:
    - bathroom use at night - 1-2 times
    - lower back pain – did not have it but it even before treatments it would
    come and go

    Treatment:
    Scar Treatment with Pocranium => left upper thigh and right inner thigh
    (location torn ligaments)
    Reasoning:
    Scar does not bother her, but the Scar might be right on: the Bladder
    Meridian (left side) and the Kidney Meridian (right side).
    ResuIt:
    After the Scar Treatment her Kidney Meridian (R) dropped (it dropped before
    in the previous session but not now at first).

    Measurements:
    No Whiplash or Spin Inversion

    Small Intestine (L) - Leptospirose Canicola
    Nervous System (L) - Mercury
    Large Intestine - Appendicitis, Chronic Appendicitis
    Lungs (L) - Chlamydia Pneumoniae
    Circulation - Selenium
    Bladder (L) - Hormeel
    Kidney (R) - corrected by the other Remedies
    Gallbladder (L+R) - Atropinum
    Liver (L)
    Spleen - corrected by the other Remedies

    2nd Measurements: 
    Bladder (R) - Ovarium
    Skin meridian (L) - Psorinum (Schwefheel did not match)

    Footplates:
    Cerebrum, Viscum, Thalamus, Ovarium, Psorinum, Berberis (Adrenal/Kidney/
    Gallbladder), Spascupreel (Gallbladder), Cutis Comp (Skin)

    3rd Measurement: 
    no drops

    3rd Session

    Feedback from the client:
    - Bathroom use at night – usually once or twice a night (one night it was 3
    or 4 times)
    - Lower back pain - was not present
    - Not aware of huge stress factors in her life (just some at work, some
    because of relationships)

    Measurement and >12 Program:
    Large Intestine (R) - proximal point - Bact.Pyo, Bact.Lactis, Bact.Coli,
    Bact.Proteus 

    Other Remedies used:
    Schwefheel, Psorinum, Leptandra, Cutis Comp

    2nd Measurement: 
    no drops

    Footplates:
    Viscum (Alopecia?), Cerebrum (better sleep and handling of stress?), Mucosa
    (for mucous membrane), Nux Vomica (for Large Intestine lining), Calcoheel
    (Calcium metabolism), Solidago, Placenta, Circulo (Circulation and to help
    her Skin condition)

    3rd Measurement: 
    no drops

    * Since Stress is the factor that brings out her symptoms, and Stress
    sensitivity is always related to the Gallbladder, this Meridian needs more
    focus.

    * Gallbladder disturbances => constriction of the Smaller Bloodvessels
    towards the skin. 

    * Liver/Gallbladder issues => Muscle weakness (weak Bladder)

    * Alopecia indicates severe problems on the Bladder and Gallbladder
    meridians which run both over the head.

    * Also, as Karolina pointed out, the body shows two extremes: light and
    dark spots.Whenever there are extremes, the cause is very often the
    Gallbladder.

    * Billiary Cirrhosis and Cholecystitis are the remedies that are most
    likely to match. And at the same time you need to use Gallbladder Support
    remedies.

    * In Vitiligo the Pineal Gland might be a suspect, but you always need to
    balance the whole Hormonal System anyway...
   
    * Try to assess whether the spots are on particular Meridians.

    * The Lower Back Pain might also be caused by a difference in the length of
    the Legs => Also a Gallbladder issue (different muscle tension in right and
    left leg)

    So I think you should focus on the Gallbladder mainly!

High Sounds => Real Causes

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
March 2014 edited March 2014 in Measurement Flag
To make this useful information better accessible I have copied it from a
different category to put it under Measurement:

" I believe there are some misunderstanding around High Endorphins. There are
no high sounds when there is an excess of Endorphins. The "high" in Endorphin
High is only a reference to the "high" that one experiences, just like you can
experience a (suppressive) high from drugs… It has nothing to do with high
pitched sounds.
There has been a lot of discussion about this in earlier posts...

Because of the confusion we no longer use Endorphin High in Biontology
terminology, but call the situation Endorphin Mask, which hopefully will cause
less confusion.

The whole idea of relevance of high sounds comes from the observations made
with a High Pressure Probe (Voll measurements). 
With the high pressure probe of Voll's instruments you'll have to press to a
deeper level to get a measurement and there won't be any drops ever. So the
whole measurement system is different!

Even when you would measure high sounds with the Voll measurement system, they
would be limited to points connected to the acute infection/inflammation and
would rarely show on more than one or two points and especially not on all
these different systems at the same time.
However, we can not imitate the Voll measurements with the Chiren!

We work with the Low Pressure Probe of the Chiren, that is very sensitive and
needs very little pressure. If we press too hard the measurements are useless.

When you have a high sound, what you need to do is lower your pressure because
what you are actually doing is pressing through the level of accurate
measurement so you might fail to detect the drop that is actually there.

Note: Maybe the observation that these high sounds don't drop is the reason why
some therapists have adopted the false belief that the high sounds reflect
endorphins. But what should have been the conclusion is that one has pressed
through the point and needs to apply less pressure.

It is important to be aware that different skin types and locations need
different pressure. Different levels of pressure might be needed on different
points of one and the same client. Pressing too hard easily gives a high
measurement. Liver points for example almost always sound high. Moist or
irritated skin also gives high readings. You also need to be aware of damaged
skin (cracks, wounds, burns, bruises, scars, too much measuring etc.).

Only on very, very rare occasions a high measurement in absence of the above
factors can reflect infection/inflammation. But this will only affect one or
two points and the graph will almost go through the roof."

    I need to know much more about this "low pressure probe" and "pressing
    through the level of accurate measurement" … 

    I had to re-train myself on the Chiren I use now, because the one I
    originally used at the doctor's office for 18 months started out with a
    high-pitched "tone" - nothing like the one I have now with an "electronic
    deep buzzing" sound. The two are completely different. 

    The higher tone was so easy to hear the drop, it was instantaneous. I have
    always pressed harder to get that sound I think. But now when I started to
    hardly press at all and only get that low buzzing sound, it is not picking
    up the same amount of drops that I did get before. I know that some people
    have intestinal issues, and yet only one drop was found today on someone -
    which surprised me. 
   
    I need to be sure that this new way of probing is correct for me.

    Thanks for the clarification Karolina. In our Basics 1 class Nora taught us
    that high sounds on most or all points were caused by an endorphin high.
    That's probably where misinformation started.

    Kathryn,
    It is very hard to discuss measurement with written words obviously, but I
    too have worked with Chirens with both the high sound and the lower sound.
    Right now I work on one with the high pitched sound.

    This might seem strange to you, but it is an illusion that they need
    different amounts of pressure. The probes are exactly the same and only the
    sound box that creates the tone is different (different batch that Schwab
    received when ordering parts).

    So as for finding the right pressure (which differs with every different
    skin type and condition too), the high tone Chiren might cause you to give
    too little pressure or the low tone Chiren might cause you to give too much
    pressure… I don't know how you adapted, but you should not adapt the amount
    of pressure to the sound box. What is needed is exactly the same optimum
    pressure for the same person.

    Of course when you get a very low deep buzzing sound this means that your
    pressure is not enough or that your not on a point, that is if there are no
    other measurement problems like someone using skin cream.
    You should get a clear sound on both Chirens.

    The above post was mostly meant to explain why the whole idea of the
    relevance of "screaming sounds" is an illusion. People have read books and
    assumed that whatever Voll wrote applied to the Chiren measurement too, but
    they never verified this with Johan. Voll's findings/writings are based on
    the high pressure probe which is not able to correctly measure drops. So
    his measurements were mainly based on high sound vs. low sound, while our
    measurements are based on drop vs. no drop.

    Jiri,
    We are aware of this. It is one of the reasons for us to pay extra
    attention to the subject and explain why this whole idea is not correct.
    Most likely Nora got the idea from studying Voll's literature. Johan never
    taught her this.

    Karolina - I sent you a soundfile so that you could hear the difference
    when I am not pressing hard and when I press slightly harder to stop that
    low buzz sound and actually get a real sound (level or dropping). I have to
    admit that I prefer the higher "tone" sound of the Chiren I used before to
    this deeper electronic sound (not like a musical note at all anymore). It
    was easier to 'hear' the changes with an actual tone (especially since I
    have perfect pitch). However, I do want you to know that the more I use
    this one, the easier it gets. Sometimes it is difficult with people who
    have VERY dry skin. I sometimes wet their hands and then pat them dry with
    a paper towel. That seems to make it a lot easier to probe the points. If
    you and Johan think that is a mistake, do let me know.

    I also have to add that I never was told by Nora at any time to press
    harder to get the sound right. In fact, during our Refresher Course in
    December 2012, she had everyone probe her meridians to see how they were
    doing, and I was not pressing hard at that time (using the other Chiren at
    that point), and she said my pressure was perfect. It is definitely
    different with the two sound boxes in the Chirens. (p.s. What I am writing
    about here has nothing to do with high sound vs. low sound with probing,
    but about the difference in the high or low sound of the different Chirens
    - just to be perfectly clear here. Thank you.

    Hi Kathryn:
   
    * There is no way to assess the pressure right without the sound (with just
    a straw) => pressure needed is different for different clients, and also
    different for different points of the same client

    * And on the other hand it is also not possible to assess the pressure
    right with only the sound 

    What is necessary is the coordination between listening and feeling. So
    without hands-on guidance I have no other way to say anything about your
    measurements.

    The only thing I can share is my experience with the different "soundbox"
    in the Chiren, and there is no difference in how you need to measure.

    When all settings (which are standard for all Chirens when sold) are the
    same, there is no way that more or less pressure is needed for the same
    point with to "low sound Chiren" or the "high sound Chiren". The "soundbox"
    has no technical implications other than translating the electrical skin
    current into sound, it has no influence on the electrical current itself.

    The electrical current that is translated into sound depends only on these
    factors:
    * Whether you are on the point
    * Your pressure
    * The skin resistance in the point (moisture, thickness, distance between
    skin and point, skin cream residues etc.)

    About wetting/washing the hands, this is not a problem when you thoroughly
    dry them afterwards. If the whole hand is still wet the conduction can run
    superficially over the skin instead of through the points, so it can create
    wrong measurements.

    I like to add that sometimes our brains also play tricks on us, like with
    poring water in a long tall glass or a low wide glass => the same amount of
    water in the low wide glass seems to be less.

    This is just theory of course, but it might be that with the "high sound
    Chiren" it seems less pressure is needed than with the "low sound Chiren". 

    I work regularly on both… and with your question in mind it is still
    difficult to compare. Every measurement is a new moment and remembering
    past pressure and conditions for me seems to be impossible. It just doesn't
    feel different that much to me.

    Anyway, I'm glad to hear you are getting used to your new Chiren.

Programming Chikey Card

    It is the same protocol as for creating a Remedy card for the Chiren:

    Loading Remedies from Chiren onto blank chip cards:
    Click on the green slots on left hand side of the screen
    Click OWN REMEDIES
    NEW
    Type in Name of Remedy
    Put in card with chip facing you until you hear a click
    Press ok

    Remove Card - Write the name of that remedy on it with permanent pen and
    place on the foot plates with chip part facing down
    Put remedy into the left hand (Green) slot - the one you want on the card
    Run the Remedy Program to put the remedy on the card

    A little trick.  Before you break the simcard loose remember to copy it
    back in the Chiren. This way you only have to copy the card next time you
    need one of the same cards.

    To get rid of confusion that people seem to have around the subject, I will
    extend on the above Chikey card protocol:

    "Loading Remedies from Chiren onto blank chip cards:
    Click on the green slots on left hand side of the screen
    Click OWN REMEDIES
    NEW => or CHIKEY CARD
    Type in Name of Remedy => when using the CHIKEY CARD button, put all the
    desired remedies in the slots
    Put in card with chip facing you until you hear a click
    Press ok
    Remove Card - Write the name of that remedy on it with permanent pen and
    place on the foot plates with chip part facing down
    Put remedy into the left hand (Green) slot - the one you want on the card
    Run the Remedy Program to put the remedy on the card"

    Both choices "NEW" and "CHIKEY CARD" allow you to attach a name to the
    Chikey card. This is what is important. The remedies that are loaded need
    to be attached to a name that is programmed first.

    The difference between the "NEW" button and the "CHIKEY CARD" button is
    that the lather will also attach the separate remedy names that are in the
    slots during programming the Chikey Card name to the chip card. In practice
    I have seen both methods work…. it is your own choice.

    In the new technical manual the option with the CHIKEY CARD button is
    described, and this is also what is going to be taught from now on.

    To further clarify:
    In the description above it mentions placing the remedies in the slots
    twice (both before and after placing the chip card into the Chiren). Does
    it matter if they are placed into the slots before or after inserting the
    chip card, as long as they get into the slots before the card is placed on
    the footplate?

    Is there any advantage to attaching the separate remedy names that are in
    the slots by using the Chikey Card button (which does not happen when using
    the New button)?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    July 2014 Flag
    Putting the remedies in the slots before the card-name is written, so the
    specific remedy names can be transferred to the card along with the
    card-name is only of importance when you use the CHIKEY CARD button. The
    NEW button does not transfer the remedy names to the card, so here it does
    not matter when you put them in… Of course they need to be in the slots
    when the card is on the foot plate and you run the remedies-program.

    Maybe there is an advantage to have the separate names written on the card,
    maybe not. I haven't seen any problems using just the NEW button.

    I've made a large number of cards via the "New Button" and am relieved to
    know that I won't need to redo all of them!  :)

    Yet I'm wondering why Dr. Schwab would go to the effort to assign a name to
    each remedy with the Chikey Card button which he did not do with the New
    button?  It's not as if the names of the remedies can ever be seen when
    placing the card into the Chikey or Chiren.

    I would think he would have had a purpose for doing so, otherwise it would
    have been a wasted effort.  -  Not something that I imagine a busy
    physicist would want to do...
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    July 2014 edited July 2014 Flag
    Yes there was a reason…

    Initially the idea was, that both information and name of the remedies
    would be transferred at once with this button. In theory it should have
    worked but it did not. Loading the cards on the foot plates still proved to
    be a necessary step to make the cards effective…

    So I think it was indeed a wasted effort, considering we still have to load
    the cards with the light. But that is what happens a lot to physicists when
    trying new things I can imagine ;-) 

    * But who knows…. there still might be an added benefit to the separate
    names! It must be subtle though, since the cards loaded with the NEW button
    worked very well.

Psychology & Chiren

Sylvia
June 2013 edited January 2014 in Psychology Flag
As a psychologist I strive to find the most efficient ways of using the Chiren
to work with my clients. I have had much success with depression and bipolar
clients. I know to focus on the Gallbladder primarily to alleviate these
problems.

During our seminar Johan gave the analogy of a ship with anchors and those
being cut too soon leaving the person with heavy psychological problems
including a tendency for pathological liars. What would be the approach in
healing that? I am wondering if this is a way of helping people who are
sociopaths?

I have used Little Flannel Flower to help connect to the Inner Child, Luesinum
for fear. Any other suggestions? Is there a special process for healing this?

Thanks!

    Many psychological issues react very well on the Chiren treatment. 
   
    However in treating Pathological Lying, Narcissism, Borderline etc.... we
    have seen little to no success. Although these people on a physical level
    can be helped a lot usually... 

    Interesting is that psychologically often the opposite happens with these
    heavy issues ==> a level of physical wellbeing and recovery from an illness
    (caused by the treatment) can even magnify the feeling of specialness and
    self-righteousness... 
    When a problem is not owned by the client it seems not to respond to the
    light treatment... (no matter what remedies you use!!!). Often lying and
    manipulation has become a character trait, rather than a disturbance to the
    body ==> it is a way of dealing with the world that is successful (to a
    certain extend of course).

    My interest lies with these especially difficult cases too, but I haven't
    found the answer yet. Biontology seems to have an attraction to people with
    severe mental illnesses, so if you find an answer please share it!

    Interesting. Thanks for responding. I was hoping to find a magic cure.  So,
    most psychiatric/psychological disorders can be treated as long as it is
    not personality disorders. I've had much success with depression and
    bipolar disorders. I guess personality disorders as well as pedophiles do
    not seem to gain improvement as a result of biophotons. 

    Lying and manipulation are often a result of fear. Any chance that if
    arrested and treated early the person may not develop a personality
    disorder? It would make sense and would make a case for treating children
    early on.

    I'll definitely continue my quest for answers and let you know if I find
    any.

    I believe if you are in time to prevent the complete splitting of from
    certain feelings (especially fear!), there is still hope. But when someone
    is in complete denial and everything is projected onto others, the world
    etc. it becomes very difficult to help... I don't like to say never, since
    I still believe there must be an answer in Biontology.... 

    Maybe the aggravation that sometimes happens in personality disorders
    because of the treatment, might also have to do with feelings coming up
    stronger or that they become more aware, but since the pattern is one of
    projecting, the condition seems to worsen when you look at it from the
    outside... 
    This would give some hope, because with a lot of guidance to help the
    client own the feelings that are coming up some healing can be done... The
    owning part is not easy to sell though, because in the short run it feels
    much better to "cast the feelings onto someone or something else".

    From your experience with personality disorders, you probably know how
    cunning people can be in using everything you say as a protection of their
    weaknesses... Many people with personality disorders go into the "therapy
    business".

    Children are always much easier to treat, whatever the condition...

    There is a sense of empowerment with the Chiren treatments and I can see
    your point of people getting worse instead of better as a result since they
    would then feel that they are in their right to be arrogant, etc. 
    Personality disorders are the most difficult to treat and sociopaths are
    often seen as having no hope since changing their patterns is most
    challenging precisely because they feel in their right to be as they are.
     I'd then be inclined to think if may have to do with some karmic or soul
    path that may require a higher vibration to shift it. Yet, I'm not giving
    up hope.  ;)

    Inspiring words. Personality issues seem the hardest to change and to have
    the deepest roots.

    The five element theory in chinese culture applies to medicine, the
    I-Ching, astrology, and food. My mom has been a student of chinese
    astrology for many decades. She notes that every person, according to
    chinese methods of drawing up a chart, has a certain proportion or
    disproportion of the five elements (earth, metal, water, wood, fire) in his
    or her chart. This unique make up of the elements influences his or her
    health, personality, and life circumstances when played out against the
    larger macrocosm acting upon him or her (time and place also have assigned
    elements).

    Your discussion raises a topic my mom and I have long wondered about: the
    relationships between free will, intention, awareness, destiny, birth and,
    possibly, karmic, tendencies and characteristics.

    I remember Johan telling us about how he had treated and cured an ALS
    patient I think it was, and how this person ended up unable to escape death
    by another means. Not meaning to be pessimistic, just trying to remind
    myself that other forces we don't understand may have a hand in things and
    that, perhaps, we cannot rule out one's personal fate.

    As healers, yes, we must all try and be open to everything. I like that
    approach.

    On this topic of treatment for psychological....I have found over the
    years, that treating a person on SSRI is most difficult.  As we know the
    drug suppressed the individual and using naturopathy, acupuncture tends to
    release the inner, suppressed condition.  So in my acupuncture practice I
    do not take these types of people.  It often results in a melt down.  I
    would love to see the Chiren solve this problem since this country (US) is
    filled with people on SSRI's....

    dissociation, etc. with all of this, and much more. He is 4 1/2 now. So,
    this is my project. How to prevent & heal this. Sometimes it is no fun at
    all how some of your Life Work is presented to you. My background is in
    mental health, as well. I have a very fine energy field myself so feel,
    see, hear, smell, etc. what is going on.

    Over the last few years, as the frequency of our planet has risen
    significantly and with many other Earth changes, people (who are not
    consciously attending to take responsibility for themselves) who were
    merely depressed or anxious, seem to be morphing into personality
    disorders. They seem to be everywhere and increasing. So, there is some
    sort of variability present and the possibility of change...and certainly
    for the children. If we can help the children stay connected to their
    hearts, and their souls, we can prevent stress and trauma in children from
    developing into personality disorders.

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

Irina
May 2013 edited January 2014 in Chikey Flag
Symptoms: Thumb gets very Painful and sometimes Numb.

Question: What might be the Cause for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?

Comments

    The Cause of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is most likely Calcification.

    The Calcification influences blood supply to the area and impairs movement
    as well.

    Radiation from a mouse might also be a Cause, when the affected hand is
    used for mouse operation.

    Would it be appropriate to give the mouse a short standard treatment the
    same way that a Cell Phone is treated?

    Yes good thinking.... go ahead. But you'll have to treat when the mouse is
    sending. So you have to click on it or move it while treating it. This
    seems somewhat unpractical...;-) 

    A Client in the Netherlands had -unexpected- great success with Carpal
    Tunnel Syndrome in a friend, when he experimented with the Chikey on her...

    http://www.biontology.com/home/testimonials/

    The only thing she used was a Chikey-Card I created for Aura/Energy (I
    didn't use Bush or Bach)..... Unfortunately he has the list of what I
    used.... but at least Neuralgo-Rheum (high potency Causticum), Ozaliet,
    Selenium, Berberis, Montmorronite, Coenzyme were in there....

    Thank you, Karolina. I saw a client yesterday for the second time. One of
    her reasons for coming for treatment is needing surgery for Carpal Tunnel
    as well as a malfunctioning Thyroid with a Nodule in Thyroid and being
    exhausted all the time.

    When I saw her I measured for Barijodeel in her Circulation system and she
    returned yesterday with no pain in her wrist! A very happy client. 

    It is interesting that in two treatments I have not had drops in the
    Thyroid point but have had in the Parathyroid, Chronic Tonsillitis matched.

    The Symptoms of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome originate in a Calcified
    Circulation, so the Parathyroid is Causal...

    However Carpal Tunnel usually comes together with Thyroid disturbances,
    this might be just because often Parathyroid and Thyroid are disturbed at
    the same time (Whiplash / Chronic Tonsillitis).

    you've put on the Aura/Energy card for the Chikey. I cannot find in my

    I'm also curious why you put Coenzyme in there for Aura/Energy?

    Coenzym contains all elements if the Citric Acid (or Krebs) Cycle, which is
    the chain of chemical reactions in the Mitochondria that creates Cellular
    Energy. So it is a remedy that supports Energy Production on the most
    fundamental level.... 

    Montmorronite is not a remedy that is standard in the Chiren, I probably
    shouldn't have mentioned it, since not everybody has it. But it is a remedy
    that works well in case of EMF exposure...

    Carolina, When your friend used the Chikey with the supports,

    1) Did his client continue using the mouse to the degree she had when she
    developed carpal tunnel?  Would this work for people who have more
    extensive  issues from EMF exposure, could they treat themselves everyday
    with the Chikey when leaving work, if that environment is high in EMF's?  

    2) If Neuralgia-Rheum is high potency Causticum what circumstances dictate
    using one over the other?  Thanks  judyth

    Judyth:

    1) I don't think her Carpal Tunnel was caused by the use of a mouse, but I
    know for sure nothing else had changed in her life apart from using the
    Chikey on a regular basis. 
    So if she was working with the mouse a lot she still is.... The guy who was
    treating her with the Chikey is not a therapist, just a friend.

    2) Causticum Compositum is a remedy that is mainly used for the physical
    effects of radiation. 
    High potency Causticum as in Neuralgo Rheum is better to use in case of the
    energetic effects of radiation. It is indicated for "hypersensitivity".
  •

    June 2013 edited June 2013 Flag
    Karolina:

    Why would causticum (a very low D3 potency) be more beneficial than
    Neuralgo-Rheum for the “physical” effects of radiation? Especially since
    low potencies tend to (for lack of a better word) put things “in” and high
    potencies tend to take them “out”. In fact why would we ever want to put
    radiation (low dose causticum) “in”?

    You mention using high potency Neuralgo-Rheum for “hypersensitivity” due to
    the energetic effects of radiation. What types of "energetic" symptoms
    would you expect to see match for Neuralgo Rheum? Are you referring to
    symptoms of the nervous system as being energetic? For instance neuralgia,
    which many considered a physical symptom but could be argued to be
    energetic in terms of physiology?

    I may be seeing someone who is currently undergoing radiation treatments.
    I'll give him Causticum for sure and wonder if he might also benefit from
    support with Neuralgo-Rheum to deal with both physical and possible
    energetic effects? 

    Thanks!

    Causticum is not radiation, it is a homeopathic remedy made from Caustic
    Potash (Potassium Hydroxide)
    So it is used for the effects of Radiation but is not Radiation itself.... 
    It is not a Toxin that has to be eliminated by the body..... 
    Low Potencies work more physical, High Potencies are more energetically and
    work deeper into the system.
   
    Causticum is indicated for nervous sensitivity, but also emotional and
    energetic sensitivity....
  •

    Very interesting! 

    1. How does putting low dose Caustic Potash "IN" help take radiation "Out"?
      (Again for a lack of better words).

    2. Then Neuralgo-Rheum should be taking any Potassium Hydroxide "Out" of
    the body since it is high potency.   Is Potassium Hydroxide already
    naturally in the body and combined/adhered to the radiation so the two are
    pulled out together?  Or is Potassium Hydroxide a similar wave length to
    radiation?

    3. I don't see anywhere in the heel manual where it indicates what
    causticum is made out of.  Is there a good resource where I could have
    researched that for myself? 

    4. Did you mean that Neuralgo-Rheum (not causticum) is indicated for
    nervous, emotional, and energetic sensitivity?
  •

    1. Radiation doesn't have to be taken out.... it just damages the system
    (body + energetics) and this has to be restored. Homeopathic remedies have
    certain "properties", and one of the indications of Causticum (Caustic
    Potash) is Radiation Damage. This is all according to the principles of
    cure like with like... 
    You can read up on Causticum in the Homeopathic Materia Medica, just google
    it...

    2. No... again you can only use this "model" of opposite information for
    Toxins and Disease Causing Factors... but with all the other Homeopathic
    Remedies it is not very useful. 
    If there was a Potassium Hydroxide poisoning though you could use the
    remedy in this way (to take it out).... I don't know how many times you
    will encounter this situation ;-)

    3. Internet... there's so much good information about Homeopathic Remedies
    available...

    4. It is not designed that way by Heel, but if you look at its components
    it makes sense.

    Diagnostic radiation "energy", and radiation from things like flying in a
    plane, usually goes through the body, and damages it on the way out.

    However, the radiation from Fukushima, Cheronobyl, and nuclear test sites
    includes radioactive "particles" containing radioactive "energy".  These
    particles can be inhaled, ingested, and lodge in the body creating
    additional damage for many years depending on their half life.  In a sense
    they are the "gift that keeps giving"... 

    In the case of radioactive particles, (not just radioactive energy that
    immediately exits the body) it would be nice to get the actual particles
    out or at least neutralize them.  Otherwise we are only dealing with their
    immediate effects and the client will require years of treatment as the
    damage continues to occur from those particles.  Is there a remedy to help
    release, or neutralize, the actual particles that continue to give off
    radiation?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    June 2013 edited June 2013 Flag
    Johan's experience in Japan and with people who had a nuclear accident at
    Los Alamos NM is that the Biophoton Treatment itself takes the disturbance
    away (the Radiation, including transforming the particles...?) and
    Causticum deals with the damage...

    Of course this is a way of explaining it, but these people were all healed
    from their Radiation problems. Johan monitored them 2 year long, and no
    Radioactive Decay was measured to be a problem anymore. (there was no
    Radiation Damage appearing during those 2 years, and in case of decay of
    particles this should have been a problem)

    Biontology until now is experience based and not every single action in the
    body is explained. So we just know what works and what doesn't... But as
    long as there is no longer a "Radiation Illness" and people become healthy
    again.. this is good enough for me.

    In October we are visiting Japan again, they have a request for a lot of
    Chikeys because they have a lot of success with using the Starlight in the
    Fukushima area. Unfortunately the Japanese Biontologists can't take part of
    this forum because they hardly speak any English.

Dry Eyes/ Muscle Aches

megan_wick
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Symptoms Flag
My mom has had extremely dry eyes now for a year and a half and has had muscle
aches as well.  

The eyes have gotten better in the past 6 months but are still dry. The last 3
times I've measured her, there has been no drops on the hands or feet.  

Is something masking the problem and what might that be? If not, do you have
any suggestions for treatment?

    Hi Megan,

    Are these the only symptoms that your mother experiences? 

    Do you have more details on what the symptoms were when you started to
    treat her? Was there a change in your mothers life right before her eyes
    got worse? What other symptoms did she have when you started treating her?
    What systems were affected (measurements) and what remedies did you find
    when you treated her? How did her condition change because of the treatment
    (apart from her eyes getting better)?

    Since Biontology is not symptom treatment you can only get a good
    assessment if you review the whole condition of a client.
   
    Also since the eyes have become better your mother's body is healing.
    Sometimes when you've corrected the energetic condition it takes a while
    for the physical body to fully restore itself. As long as the body is
    healing you can continue to support the organs that were the cause of the
    problem.
   
    Dry eyes unlike  eye-function problems are not caused by the Stomach.
   
    The cause might be calcification or cramping of tear ducts (Barijodeel,
    Aurumheel, Atropinum). Or there might be a lack of lymph flow (Lymphomyosot
    can help with this). Also Oculoheel has an indication for dry eyes and can
    be used as support.

    Does your mom still have muscle aches, this shows a circulatory problem
    that might also be a cause.

    These are the only symptoms that she has been experiencing for quite a
    while. I didn't start treating her, someone else did and that's what got me
    interested in this.  She has drops in just about everything.  She started
    treatment because of her eyes.  About the time that her eyes started to bug
    her, her dad passed away. 
   
    Rita, the person that treated her, tested the emotional stuff on her about
    her dad but nothing showed up on that. She was physically/verbally abused
    by him as a child.  What did show up on the emotions was that there were
    issues with my brother.  She had postpartum depression after he was born.  

    Her energy did seem to improve along with more regular bowel movements.
     There was a lot of intestinal issues that were treated along with nervous
    system, circulation, lymphatic, etc.  Everytime I've checked the meridians
    on her hands and feet lately, there haven't been any drops.  She seems to
    always have muscle aches/pains tho not severe, everyday.

    You say that there are a lot of Intestinal issues. 
    Are the drops on the right hand or the left hand? Small or Large Intestine?
    With what did you correct the Nervous System?
    There must be drops if she has muscle pains all the time. It is unlikely
    that there are Endorphins, otherwise she would not have pain.
    What muscles hurt?
    I have too little information to give any clues.

Loss of Hair / Diffuse Alopecia

SabaKeiserSabaKeiser
February 2013 edited January 2014 in Symptoms Flag



Client:
Female, 50 years old, slim, widowed, in her menopause - she has a healthy
lifestyle

Symptoms:
She started to loose her hair in 2007 and still is loosing her hair. She is
afraid to loose all her hair. She is not taking any medicine nor having an
illness.

Medical Diagnoses:
She went to different specialist and all the tests (Hormones, Thyroid etc.)
were ok. They told her that they don’t know why she is loosing her hair, but
she is definitely having a diffuse Alopecia, and gave her a lotion to put on
her scalp.

Anamnesis:
In 1970 she had an accident and lost a part of her finger pad on the left index
finger. In 1999 she had an operation to bring her jaw forward and in 2011 she
had a Myomectomy.

She is the youngest of four children, she has three older brothers and the
fifth child died shortly after birth. Father died in 1999 unexpectedly, Mother
died in 2006 of Stomach-Cancer (Parents were farmers). One brother suffers from
headache arising from back problems.

Measurement and Treatment:

Drops on Triple Warmer, Circulation, Small Intestines, Heart, Large Intestines,
Gallbladder and Liver

First two sessions: Spin-Inversion, Vaccinations, Metals, airborne toxins and
also Salmonella Paratyphi, Chronic Appendicitis, Placenta, Candida Albicans,
Glyoxal, Veratrum, Cactus Compositum, Aurumheel, Tuberculinum, Mucosa, Chronic
Tonsilitis, Injeel Chol, Gelsemium, Coenzym, Hepar, Klimaktheel 

We also did the mothers name in the cup as she started to loose her hair
approx. 6 months after her mother died and she was the one who took care of her
when she was terminal at home (mother died at home and they had an unpleasant
relationship).

Third session: Ovarium, Varicellen, Calculi Renales, Chronic Appendicitis,
Calculi Billiaris, Cuprum, Aluminium, Plumbum Metallicum, Salmonella Paratyphi,
Strophantus Compositum, Tonsilitis, Cholecystitis and Leptandra.

As of now she can’t see any change of loosing hair. She is still using her
liquid for the scalp.

How would you advise me to go forward?

Thank you!

    I think Johan said support with Cutis Compositum for loosing hair and
    continue to support circulation in addition to treating all the drops you
    measure on the system.  Maybe too, Pulsitilla & Procranium, and Red Suva
    Frangipani and Star of Bethelem if you have extra spaces for bush and bach
    at the end.  Just some thoughts.
   
    I do believe Cutis Compositum has helped some of my clients grow their hair
    back after the Triple Warmer was balanced.

    Hello Saba,

    I'd like to know what is the "healthy lifestyle" that your client has. What
    seems healthy sometimes in reality isn't. 
    For example: Some "healthy" diets can set someone up for deficiencies, What
    now is considered "healthy exercise" might exhaust the Adrenals etc.
    Both Adrenal Fatigue and deficiencies can cause hair loss....

    Adrenal Fatigue can also originate from this stressful relationship with
    her mother and the care taking at the end of her mother's life. Very
    stressful and very exhausting. Also very frustrating... 

    What did you measure on her Circulation? 
    Stress on the Gallbladder (also suppressed anger) can cause cramping of the
    blood vessels which might block the blood supply to the hear follicles.. In
    this case Atropinum or Gallbladder remedies should match on the
    Circulation.

    Also I'd like to know how the condition of her Thyroid is (not in the
    medical diagnoses but in the measurement). It might be that she's
    hyperthyroid and this can also cause Alopecia. 

    Was there a Whiplash? Maybe Emotional Whiplash? Does she expresses herself?

    For the symptoms of hair loss: Cutis Compositum is very effective like Jan
    wrote.

May 2015 - Measuring Appendicitis

Question
I sometimes measure all points dropping on the Large Intestine meridian on both
hands, EXCEPT for the Appendix point, but still Appendicitis Necroticans
matches. Is this possible?

Answer
Appendicitis can be measured on all points of the Large and Small Intestine.
You should not limit measuring the remedies on just the Appendix point.

    When a person has removed the Appendix. 

    1. Do you only treat the energetic problems only once? 
    2. Do you use the three Appendicitis remedies then, or only what you
    measure? 
    3. Can you measure and treat Appendicitis more than once after you have
    removed the Appendix?
  •

    June 2015 Flag
    Answers:
    1. Energetic problems may go away at once, but they can also return at
    once.
    This means that one can measure them more than once. In this case the
    reason for the drop(s) is systemic.
    2. With the three Appendicitis nosodes you start with the form that you
    measure. In case it is Chronic Appendicitis you add Appendicitis. This is
    to prevent the appendicitis of becoming acute.
    Remember that the Appendicitis nosodes can match many points, especially on
    Large and Small Intestine. This happens because the infection spreads also
    to other parts.
    The drops on other parts can also be present if the Appendix itself has
    been surgically removed. These drops are then amongst the consequences of
    the Appendicitis.
    3. Yes

    When the appendix is removed and you treat until it doesn't show in
    measurement again, can the appendix still start dropping after a while? I
    thought once the appendix was removed and the energetic disturbance was
    removed, that it could not come back?

    The appendicitis itself should not come back, but of course any other
    infection is still possible in the Intestines.
    If you have a different infection, the Appendicitis nosode might still
    react because it is also an infection.

    situation?

Antibiotics

sallydyer
December 2013 edited January 2014 in Medication Flag
Client:
Woman

Symptoms:
Granuloma Annulare = raised red circles all over her body (= reason for coming
to see me) 

Medical interventions:
Dentist prescribes antibiotics before every teeth cleaning because of her 2 hip
replacments and a non functioning heart valve. He is afraid that the bacteria
from her mouth will go right to her hip or she will have a heart attack in the
chair. This has made her very fearful of her dental cleanings.
She also had shoulder surgery and a hysterectomy.

Medication:
4 x 1000mg antibiotics 1 hour before her dental appointment.
She has been doing this regiment for 12 years.

Treatment:
I have been following the protocol.

Questions:
1. Can you give me some advice to share with her why she should not get these
antibiotics before her cleanings?
2. Does skin issues belong to the Lung and Large Intestine?

    I had this condition for nearly seven years in the more rare generalized

    localized form) and it resolved after just a few treatments.  
    My husband and I are seeing an experienced Biontologist for treatments as
    we are still too novice to treat each other.  

    Question for you Sally: 
    I am curious how your client is doing in regards to her Granuloma
    Annulare.  
    This was only one of many issues that the Chiren, in the right hands, has
    resolved for me, but when I saw that condition listed, became very curious
    as to your success so far with it.  
  •

    The antibiotics can very well be the cause of these granuloma and also of
    the other problems.

    1. Things you can talk about:
    * Most bacteria are totally resistant against all antibiotics.
    * Antibiotics weaken the immune system tremendously. 
    * The antibiotics might be more dangerous than the bacteria. (resistant
    bacteria survive, and than will thrive in a weakened body)
    * Biontology strengthens the immune system, so even IF the bacteria will
    travel (which I doubt, because they can only reach the hip through the
    blood) the body usually will get rid of the bacteria before they can do
    harm.
    * Doctors are very afraid, and extremely careful, because of possible
    lawsuits when things go wrong. That is why even if the risk is almost
    non-existant they will still give antibiotics.
    * But don't try to convince too hard, because it has to be your client's
    choice! Otherwise you will be the one held responsible... Life has not one
    single guarantee, so you can never promise that she won't have an
    infection.

    2. Skin issues sometimes are caused by the Large Intestine but not by the
    Lungs. This could be the case because she definitely has Intestinal issues.
    She will not have any Flora left. I would test the skin and see what that
    meridian responds to.

    3rd Session

    1st Measurement:
    Pituitary - Variolinum
    Parathyroid - Chronic Appendicitis (other nosodes did not work)
    Pineal - Pertussis
    Thyroid - Chronic Tonsillitis
    Kindey (R-proximal) - Calculi Bil

    2nd Measurement:
    Sex glands - Ovarium

    Veins - Hamamelis
    Circulation - Apis

    Footplate Treatment:

    Selenium, Berberis, Tonsilla Comp, Aesculus, Lymphomyosot, Neuralgorheum,
    Discus, Arnicaheel

    Questions:
    1. Am I using way too many supports? If yes, what would be the optimum
    support combination? Because I have difficulties in reducing the supports.

    2. 2nd session I decided to put all the intestinal flora remedies (5
    bacterias). Was that a good decision? Because then I need to reduce the
    list for nosodes to fit it in a 12 year program. Or alternatively add them
    with "2-7 year old" program. Should I have avoided adding "2-7 year old"
    program in this case?
    Adding 5 bacterias plus chronic problems like Chr Appendicitis and
    Tonsillitis already fills the slots in the 12 year program. When is the
    best time to focus only to all the intestinal flora remedies and to chronic
    issues together? After clearing the hormonal system?

    3. Is it possible that I find stones for kidneys and gallblader on opposite
    meridians?

    4. Should I have added "Cortisone" remedy first because she had it for 10
    years.

    5. Do we need to add "Penicillinum" remedy once in every case when there is
    a history of antibiotics?

    Some comments (I will leave the rest for Johan to answer and comment on):

    You continued to search for a treatment solution to improve measurements,
    but there was clearly a measurement problem the first session. Especially
    since you continue to measure all the same drops, even after treatments,
    the problem should be searched in the measurement itself. Most likely your
    client used skin cream (a very common cause for measurement problems), but
    it may also be the swelling of her hands that is in the way of a proper
    measurement.

    The aura problem could have been assessed easily by adding Ozaliet to a
    slot and measure the improvement instead of treating with it. You should
    always try to limit extra treatments as much as possible.

    I don't know where the idea comes from to use a 2-7 Years program in
    between Standard Hand treatment and Footplate treatment. This was never
    described in the protocols, but we have seen it in some of the case studies
    for certification too. 

    The nosodes should have been added to the Footplate treatment, and the
    leftover spaces could then have been used for focused support remedies.
    Then, if there was not enough balance between support and nosodes, you
    could have changed some remedies halfway. But changing remedies half way
    should be an exception and not a habit. 

    There are only 5 Intestinal Flora Bacteria. Bacterium Dystenterie is not a
    natural inhabitant of the Intestines and is a remedy that is very rarely
    needed. This bacteria causes infections with bloody and slimy diarrhoea.

    When the Parathyroid is dropping during the initial measurement of a
    session, there is no use in treating for calcification (Calculi,
    Barijodeel, Aurumheel) because the underlying cause, the calcium
    metabolism, is not healed yet.

    Hi Tufan!

    Did she have any scars anywhere? maybe the knee operations left scars?
    With treating my mom, taking care of her huge scars seemed to help a lot.

    According to Protocol, we then check for Spin Inversion and then for
    Whiplash, but after you did check and run Spin Inversion program, it looks
    like you then ran the 12 Years program with just Polio and Antitetanus and
    only after that, you gave the Whiplash treatment.. So it reads a bit in
    incorrect order...

    To keep hearing drops is so frustrating, I've been there... :-S
    But before you give up; what Karolina writes above has helped me so much;
    the oily skin.
    I know it gets very confusing if all points keep dropping, I now have
    learned from Karolina and Johan to suspect oily skin, so most of the time I
    ask the client if he/she can please wash and dry their hands (even feet if
    needed there too) and then I try again. In most cases, the points read
    different straight away and can be corrected.

    Dear Karolina,

    Thank you for the comments. I guess there is a small change in the order of
    my first treatment after your amendment. I did the whiplash treatment
    before the 12 year program in the first session.

    Dear Kat,

    Thank you too. She had very small scars On her knees. I guess it was
    laparoscopic surgery. Normaly I cover all major scars in the beginning of
    the first sesion.

    Oily skin definitely needs attention.

    Thanks! :)

    1. If a person has arthritis or rheumatism ALL focus should be on the
    Kidneys, including the support remedies. 

    2. One should never use the 2-7 program after the >12 years program. This
    is not part of a normal session.
    The use of Intestinal Flora remedies depends on the purpose. If:
    A. You want to reintroduce the bacteria into the intestines => this is only
    useful when the intestines are clean of all infections and possibly of
    Diverticulose. 
    B. The purpose is to address the bacterial infections on the organs => then
    the nosodes can be used earlier.

    3. It is possible to use Calculi Bil and Calculi Renales on the opposite
    meridians, I some times find this too. The recommendation from Heel is to
    use them together for greater effectiveness 

    4. & 5. Treatment with Cortisone or Penicillin is not needed. They are very
    rarely needed at all. 
    You should not search for them. If no other remedy would work and this
    would fit, I would use it. But I suspect that after the treatment the point
    would drop again. Because they are not really capable of removing systemic
    causes.

    I'm also confused as to the order of treatments.  It seems that you gave
    two full treatments in the same session.  Or maybe I misunderstand your
    presentation.

Fresh Blood in Cup During >12 Years Program?!

YmkjeYmkje
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Spin Inversion & Cause Flag

I remember Johan said in course that it's also very good for 'Liver / Heart /
Circulation/ ....' to use (Fresh) Blood.

Yesterday I treated someone with Spin Inversion and after the effective Spin
Inversion Program, I felt that I want to do the Blood in the Cup during >12
Years Program....?

Question: Is it wise to use the Same Fresh Blood witch was needed for the Spin
Inversion Program also in the >12 Years Program?

    Yes, the Blood gets the right Spin in the Spiral of the Cup so you can use
    this Blood during Treatment. 

    I always leave the Blood in for the Full Session, so even on the
    Footplates. However for a Correct Measurement, you need to unplug the Cup
    and then attach it again when you start a Treatment.

    I use the Blood with the Spiral.

    The Blood I use is always on a piece of paper and I take care that it
    doesn't touch the Cup. Only the paper touches the Spiral... This way I
    don't have to clean the Cup after Spin Inversion Treatment.

    The Rods an Plates I clean with some Alcohol.

    Hi Colby,

    I am missing the most important part, which is: What did you measure? What
    exact points were dropping? Especially the points that were taught
    separately like the individual Hormone Glands. Which ones were dropping,
    and for example the Dental point on the Stomach. This is all crucial
    information that you are missing. An other thing we need to know is where
    the remedies matched or in other words which points/meridians were
    corrected by your chosen remedies?

    The remedies you used and the picture of almost all points dropping and the
    symptoms you gave do not exactly seem to match with the remedies you chose.
    But before I can comment specifically I really need to know your
    measurements. How many points were dropping per meridian, whether this was
    the meridian on the right side or the left side, and if there were points
    that were talked about in class specifically you need to mention them all. 

    Assessment is crucial in Biontology. Where is the measurement after the
    Hand Treatment...

    Also I need to know what the flare-up entailed exactly. What are the
    symptoms? What digestive issues does she have, does she have rapid
    heartbeat or irregular heartbeat, are the palpitations causing her sleep
    issues or is it something else like worry?

    Most likely you overlooked Appendicitis Necroticans! She even has
    Appendicitis in her medical history... and you used some of the Intestinal
    Flora Bacteria, which shows there is Intestinal Inflammation causing
    Dysbiosis.

    You also did not mention treating any scars, but she did have surgery...

    September 2015 edited September 2015 Flag
    And I also noticed that you changed support remedies on the footplates in
    two sessions. Why? You already used lots of support remedies. So this was
    not needed because there was already a good balance between nosodes and
    support remedies. The only time you change/add remedies is when you needed
    some extra nosodes on the footplates and thus did not have enough space for
    proper support...

    Symptoms of the flare up:
    Body severely fatigued
    Joints swollen, hot and inflamed
    Inability to move right arm and both hands
    Impingement in the shoulder from the inflammation in the joints and the
    tendons. The shoulder pain was so intense that she had a hard time
    breathing. She felt as if having a heart attack.
    Muscle weakness 
    Exhaustion 
    Severe joint pain with very limited movement 

    Measurement:
    This was my first client, and I am not sure if I got all the measurements
    after the hand treatment.
    Also, I am already so much better at measurements now...so not sure how
    accurate I was at that time.
   
    I found the following drops:
    Hormone System (R+L) - all points except Pineal Gland
    Kidney (L) - all points
    Kidney (R) - all points except undefined
    Bladder (L) - all points
    Bladder (R) - all points except undefined
    Gallbladder (R+L) - all points
    Stomach (L) - all points except undefined
    Stomach (R) - 2 drops one of them on the Jaw/Teeth
    Large Intestine (R+L) - all drops
    Small Intestine (L) - 2 undefined points
    Small Intestine (R) - all points except for undefined ones
    Lung (R+L) - all points except for Pleura(L)
    Lymphatic (R+L) - all points

    Switching remedies:
    I guess I didn't need to do this, but I think on a few of them I wanted to
    support Circulation and the joint inflammation.

    Appendicitis:
    I may have not treated witt Append Necroticans because I thought I had to
    wait until I got to the Large Intestine to treat that. I hadn't really got
    past Hormones, Kidneys and Circulation.

    Scar Treatment:
    The first session scar treatment was given on the lower abdominal area
    (hysterectomy) with the glass rods.

    Case Specific Comments
    Rheumatoid arthritis is always caused by the Kidneys, and considering the
    seriousness of her illness the focus should be completely on the Kidneys. 
    This is of the utmost urgency. If you do not treat this before you do
    anything else, problems will get far worse and she might go into Kidney
    failure, especially with the increased detox that every Chiren treatment
    always gives. This might also be the reason for the flare ups.

    The Adrenals are also very important for Kidney function, so these should
    also be treated (Selenium)
    The only other two remedies that I would have given apart from this are
    Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus (first session and only once)
    Other remedies will initiate too much detox for the Kidneys too handle
    right now.
    The Kidneys are affected by the Intestinal Flora Bacteria (Appendicitis
    picture, with Bladder/Kidney drops)
    All Bladder points and all Kidney points dropping indicates infections with
    the 4 Intestinal Flora Bacteria
    You can treat with all of these 4 bacteria (Bact Coli, Bact Lactis, Bact
    Proteus, Bact Pyo) immediately
    The Kidneys should be supported with ALL Kidney support immediately

    Her traumatic past with the loss of 4 people (3 babies and her sister) when
    she was 15, may also have weakened her Kidneys (Water Element). I suspect
    serious abandonment fears. 
    Lichen is a flower remedy that you can use to assess this and support when
    there is fear of abandonment. But most important is to let her express
    herself so these fears can surface naturally. Usually it will take some
    sessions
   
    General Comments
    In general, if the Thyroid and Parathyroid drop again after you have
    treated Whiplash in a previous session, then it is usually not Whiplash
    (unless something happened that caused whiplash again), and you need to
    look for another reason for the Thyroid and Parathyroid imbalance. But in
    this case all of your focus needs to be on the Kidneys first. This is
    critical!

    Also, If the Parathyroid still drops, there is no use in treating the
    Calculi or calcifications (Barijodeel, Aurumheel), which would have left
    you with more space for focus on the Kidneys.

    All points dropping on the Large Intestine and Small Intestine and most
    points dropping on other meridians is a clear picture of Appendicitis
    Necroticans. Since this is the underlying cause for the inflammation of the
    Kidneys this should be treated as soon as the Kidneys are in relatively
    good condition (Kidney related symptoms are improved and she has no flare
    ups after treatment anymore).
   
    Answers
    1. The last session might very well be the reason for the aggravation of
    symptoms since any session immediately leads to increased detox, something
    that the Kidneys could not handle properly yet.
    2. It is generally not necessary to treat with the vaccinations more than
    once. You should have tried something else.
    3. It might not have been a good idea to treat as you have. But, knowing
    that this woman has very weak Kidneys (rheumatoid arthritis), you should
    have treated with all 4 Intestinal Flora Bacteria and all Kidney support
    remedies.

    Thank you so much for your response, Johan.

    To clarify, the next time she gets a treatment - for the Hand treatment the
    only thing that I would put in the trays are the 4 Bacteria & Selenium- and
    then for the Foot treatment only kidney support remedies?

    Also- she may still be on steroids..would it be better to wait until she is
    off them because they can block treatment?

    Of course you always need to measure to see what is going on in her overall
    system.

    So just walk through the protocol:
    1. See whether there is Spin Inversion (if there is, it first needs to be
    treated or otherwise the treatment will have an adverse effect or no effect
    at all)
    2. Measure all point and make a note of the drops
    3. Then go to your meridians of focus, which are the two Kidney meridians
    in this case
    4. Since the Adrenal function is important for Kidney functioning, if the
    Adrenal points are dropping, measure for Selenium, which is also almost a
    sure thing... maybe Berberis is needed (you are going to use this one
    anyway as it is a Kidney support remedy as well)
    5. Then go to the Kidneys. Most likely one of the Intestinal Flora Bacteria
    will correct the drops, and if this is true put all 4 of these bacteria in
    the slots. If not put them in anyway, because your still practicing on your
    measurement and it is almost a sure thing that they are needed (measuring
    remains important for your verification)
    6. If the Kidneys still drop with the 4 bacteria in the slots, add
    Cystopyelonefritis. Sometimes there is another infection, apart from the
    Flora, on the Kidneys as well and you may also need to include
    Cystopyelonefritis, which is for general Kidney/Bladder inflammation.
    7. When Adrenals and Kidneys are corrected, run the >12 Standard Program
    with these remedies
    8. Measure to verify if the treatment worked and the Kidneys and Adrenals
    are indeed corrected (important!)
    9. Use ALL Kidney support remedies on the footplates.
    10. Make sure she rests a lot during the following days and that she drinks
    lots of pure water

    As for the steroids, they can reduce effectiveness but usually won't block
    the treatment completely. Since she responded to treatment every time,
    therapy resistance is not an issue here.

    Ok- so to follow up. My client is supposed to come tomorrow for her next
    session. I have not given her a session since the flare up...She is still
    in a flare up - the same one from 3 weeks ago. Is it ok for me to give her
    the session as Johan has guided me to above? Focusing only on the kidneys
    and kidney supports?

    This has to do with creating a message outside of the forum. This way the
    format is not recognized fully or takes up more space. 

    The other thing is that if you post by copy-pasting from a different
    program, it is very hard to edit it into a readable text. 
    So please use the special button in the formatting-bar (clipboard with
    letter T) to strip all previous formatting and make the text compatible
    with the forum.

    I also advise to follow the forum and especially read IABS messages,
    because this subject has already been dealt with several times.

    Hi Madelyn, 

    I've already edited your case. Maybe you can take a look at it, since there
    were other adjustments I had to make to make it more readable. It is
    helpful if you use as little unnecessary words as possible.
    Thank you!

Breast Cysts, Fibroid Tumors and Goiters

sallydyer
June 2013 edited January 2014 in Symptoms Flag
Questions:
1. Is it possible to shrink Breast Cysts, Fibroid Tumors and Goiters with
Chiren treatments? 

2. Client with Ulcerative Colitis is currently using medication and is advised
by his doctor to continue (he is going to college and it would help his Colon
to handle the alcohol better!)
Do you think this medication is suppressing his healing?

    1. One of my cases that might be helpful:

    Client: 
    woman with TH5 breast thermogram

    Measurements:
    Carcinoma Mammae and Mammae Cystica - regularly
    3 weeks ago Carcinoma Mammae stopped showing up.
    I will continue treating her for breast cysts until the thermogram is
    completely improved and measurements are good.

    Results:
    Thermogram improved to TH4 

    Supports used:
    Viscum (Iscador/Mistletoe), 
    Thyroid support (depending on what is measured), 
    Circulation & Adrenals (to increase blood flow & decrease stagnation of
    fluid in cysts), 
    Lymphomyosot, Gallium, Sutoxol, Glyoxol, Ubichinon, Coenzyme, Selenium, 
    Berberes, 
    Gall Bladder (especially Atropinium to reduce cramping of circulation, 
    Calcium in blood vessels to increase blood flow. 
    Her file is at my office but that is what comes to mind right now.

    Advice:
    Try all of the Breast Remedies (Carcinoma Mammae, Mammae
    Cystica, Mastophatia and Myom Uteri) on the Organ Degeneration meridian
    which, in this case, has been more reliable than the Breast Point.

    Regarding Goiters: 
    They are normally benign and caused by a lack of Iodine. 
    Try measuring Strumeel on the thyroid point. 
    Also treat the Pituitary and check for Whiplash.

    2. Regarding the Colitis: 
    Find out exactly what medication your client is taking. Corticosteroids are
    common and very suppressive. 
    The Chiren is unmasking problems (the opposite of suppression). 
    So yes, your client may be in for many more treatments in order to get the
    same result. 
   
    Depending on how much he is paying for treatments this information may
    influence him to give the Chiren a chance to work without being hampered by
    such an immune suppressing pharmaceutical when he is not having symptoms.

    Things to measure for Colitis: 
    Carcinoma Coli, Appendicitis & Tonsillitis, Podophyllum, Diverticulosis,
    Periproctic Abcess, Diarrheel, Plumbum, Belladonna, and Aesculus.

    Thank you for all that great information! 

    Measurement:
    Carcinoma Mammae - did not match. 
    Myoma Uteri and Mammae Cystica - match 
    Adrenals are a big problem!  (it's hard in Steamboat to get clients to stop
    riding their bikes so much!) 

    I do address her Circulation but I might need to add a few more Supports. 

    Client with the Goiter:
    Stumeel - measured each session 
    I do address her Thyroid 
   
    Client with Ulcerative Colitis:
    Takes Asacol - isn't a steriod but treats inflammation of the colon. 
    It is still a medication so it can' t be good for him and probably effects
    his Kidney's and Liver! 
    I have measured most of the Nosodes you suggested.

Measurement Problem

MoniqueWandersMoniqueWanders
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Measurement Flag
Client:
Male, 54 year 

Symptoms:
Extremely dry skin => from birth

Measurement problem:
Hands => No sound or a very low hum. It is impossible to distinguish drops from
no drops 
Feet => cracked skin, so mostly high sounds

Already checked the manual section about measurement problems but I do not see
a solution.

Questions:
1. Since the measurements are completely unreliable, shall I measure him with
his picture between the foot plates and treat during session? 
2. Or is there another solution?

    Answer
    1. I think you mean to suggest surrogate measuring? This is not done with
    the picture between the footplates, but with the picture (witness) on one
    footplate that is connected to the cup-port. 
    This is not wise to do, since you get the energies of your client inside
    your own system, which is not very healthy.

    2. The best way is to try and increase the Circulation in his Skin.
    Treat him first with support remedies that promote Circulation and
    Relaxation: Atropinum, Placenta, Barijodeel, Circulo, Lymphomyosot. Do a
    normal treatment and then try to measure him. 
    You may also try to have him wash his hands (no soap) and then dry it in
    the air.

    But with the extremely dry and cracked hands and feet, I don't think this
    will be sufficient. It may take a couple of sessions (and weeks) before the
    hands are reliable in measurement. There maybe some points that are
    reliable, while the rest of the points are not... you can then navigate on
    these.
    Not being able to measure does complicate things.

    colon descendens and rectum.
    2003: Constipation -> gets worse in stress time

    1st Session (last week):

    Measurement:
    Hormone System: (think) all drops
    Circulation: (think) all drops
    Large Intestine: (think) all drops

    Other points: Low humming sounds

    Result:
    Not quite able to measure if there was any result

    Question:
    See above already answered item: 'Measurement problem'.

    2nd Session (today):

    Feedback cliënt:
    Clients tells me digestion has improved a bit…

    1st Measurement:
    Tripple Warmer: (think) all drops
    Circulation & Veins: (think) all drops

    (last two for Adrenal support)

    Client informs me he is not able to come the next 4 weeks.
    I suggest to treat on Circulation with Chikey.

    Question:
    Is Chikey in this situation possible and what are suitable nosodes for the
    Chikey card?

    April 2015 edited April 2015 Flag
    Why did you use Atropinum and Circulo both in the hand treatment and in the
    footplate treatment (second session)? Once you have used a remedy there
    will be no additional effect from using it again in the same session.

    Did you treat the physical scars?

    Answer:
    You can use the Chikey with the following cards:
    Adult Hand Treatment: Appendicitis Necroticans, Chronic Appendicitis,
    Appendicitis, Diverticulose, Bact Flora (Coli, Lactis, Proteus, Pyo).
    Foot Plate Treatment: Populus, Solidago, Mucosa, Nux Vomica, Lymphomyosot,
    Cantharis, Barijodeel,Berberis

I every session she had NO Drop at the beginning, so I always started with 3 x
the 2-7 yrs Program with Plumbum, Viscum, Atropinum

    After a break of a few months I ignored the previous sessions (besides the
    vaccination).

    Results:
    Symtoms after ALL treatment => unchanged/the same
    Many of the same points dropped again => Only „progress“ => no drops on
    Circulation anymore.

    I think she comes back for treatement because she is happy with the
    psychological support...
    Now I’m very grateful for help!

    Aurumheel

    3rd Measurement:
    No Drops

    Results:
    Frequent urination => improved a lot
    Can drink much more water => without having to urinate that often (1/3
    less)
    Waking up at night to urinate (normally always at 2.45 AM = Liver / Lung
    time?) => gone

    New Information:
    Ovarian Cyst => diagnosed by doctor a long time ago => went away by itself
    Bladder Infection twice => long time ago
    Antibiotics-treatment => resulted in several temporary improvements => no
    cramps + much better bowel movement + no diarrhoea => 1 week after stopping
    antibiotics the symptoms returned

    Measurement Issue:
    During the first measurement -I measured several times- she had:
    Only a few drops on her left hand
    Far MORE drops on her right hand (almost all points on the Nervous System)
    Without any treatment or measuring of remedies, I then measured the Feet.
    Then I measured the right hand again. To my surprise most of the Drops
    „disappeared“. 
    I did not mention it to her. There was nothing special that we discussed,
    that might have influenced her points.
   
    Questions
    1. Is the fact that antibiotics improved her condition, and then 1 week
    after stopping these symptoms returned, an indication for Parasites?

    2. I’m a bit frustrated. There seem to be no treatment progress => grateful
    for guidance!

    3. What could have caused the described measurement inconsistency? 

    4. The Lungs did not drop in the first measurement. In the second
    measurement they did, and Streptococcus Haemolyticus and Staphylococcen
    matched.
    When this Lung point drops the next session, does this mean that it is time
    to treat?

    5. Could the Lungs (Staph and Strep) be the cause for the continued Kidney
    drops?

    6. When I put in Chronic Tonsillitis, it seemed to correct a point on the
    Small intestine. Is that possible?

    7. Calculi Bil, Calculi Renales, and Barijodeel kept matching, so I used
    them many times. Is this caused by an incorrect treatment approach, or is
    this normal?

    8. The same question for needing to treat with Appendicitis several
    times...? 

    9. I also treated with the Intestinal Flora Bacteria many times. I guess
    this is not correct, but what should I do if they continue to correct the
    point every time?
   
    10. I read on the forum that Lyme is mostly just a symptom of a traumatic
    childhood, and enormous stress, which would also fit in that case. 
    However, I felt a bit "pressured" to treat with the Lyme nosode immediately
    because of the possible infection and consequences. The typical signs of
    Borreliose were already showing, and Lyme matched 1 point on the Nervous
    System meridian in the first session...
    Following protocol, should I only start treating the Nervous System (and
    Lungs) when NONE of the Yang Organs have drops anymore?

    11. The 5th session I have tried to follow the protocol strictly. I only
    treated the Hormone System and the Kidneys, and ignored the Intestines.
    My understanding of the protocol is, that I have to wait with treating the
    Intestines until the Hormone System and Kidneys are OK. Is this the correct
    understanding?

    12. There is often a difference between what I hear in measurement, and the
    color indication the Chiren gives. Often I clearly hear a drop, but the
    measurement graph gives a green indication. Should I go with my own
    listening or with the color indication of the Chiren?

    13. The hand charts on the Chiren do not show all points that are given in
    the manual. I guess the missing point is always the „Undefined“ point and
    not the nail point. Is this correct? 
    What does this Points means or what additional information does this point
    give?

    14. Now I know that there is an additional point, it becomes difficult to
    register all measurements, because the Chiren cannot save the drop on
    points that are not indicated. I tried to write it down by hand, but this
    is time consuming and becomes chaotic. Do you have any advice on how to
    handle this problem?
   
    15. Berberis and Selenium are the only remedies indicated for the Adrenals.
    What can one do If they Drop again and again?

    1. There is no indication for parasites. But Crohn's disease and Colitis
    Ulcerosa are ALWAYS caused by Appendicitis Necroticans. This should be used
    solely, the chronic Appendcitis or appendicitis nosodes do not solve this
    problem. These latter nosodes should be used once the necroticans does not
    match anymore.
    But the condition leads to the absence of intestinal flora. These bacteria
    normally go to kidneys and bladder. That is where they should be treated
    even before the intestines are addressed, together with kidney supports

    3. I have no explanation for measurement inconsistencies. 

    4. The Lungs should not be treated for a while. First all the Yang organs
    should be cleared

    5. The cause for the Kidney drops is likely the Intestinal Flora. As long
    as the Intestines are not in order, the Intestinal Flora should always be
    checked on Kidneys, since the Flora will leave the Intestine as long as the
    climate there is no good.

    6. Tonsilltis/Appendcitis can affect EVERY organ.

    7. These conditions (Stones, hardening of the Blood Vessels) need up to 10
    treatments to clear after the Pituitary and Parathyroid point stay clear.
    The calcium needs to be dissolved and the body decides how much each time.
    We do not know how much calcium is deposited. If it is a little, then the
    conditions are solved quicker. We do not know how big the Stones are or how
    many there are. It makes a difference whether the Blood Vessels are blocked
    for 20% or for 90%. The maximum of 10 sessions starts when the Pituitary
    and Parathyroid Glands are showing no drops anymore.

    8. You did not treat with Appendicitis Necroticans yet, which is the nosode
    that I have found necessary in every single case of Crohn's. Appendictis
    Necroticans can show up a number of times. The Appendix is dying or already
    dead. The problem is that we do not know how much of it is dead already. It
    can be dead for 10% or for 95% or for 100%.
    If it is dead for 100%, nothing can be done since the biophoton treatment
    does not work on dead tissue. But if there is a little bit still alive, it
    can be totally regenerated. If it is 90% dead, it might take up to 6
    treatments before the matching changes to chronic appendicitis. But I have
    also seen one case where the Appendix was restored after 9 treatments. 

    In the past I have sent people to hospital after 6 sessions to have their
    Appendix removed.
    This proves often very difficult since doctors cannot find indications of
    infections since there is no increased level of leucocytes. This is caused
    by the fact that the body does not react anymore. The body has no idea that
    it is even sick and does not take action. It has been established by a
    Belgian surgeon that 70% of the population is walking around with an
    Appendicitis without any signs of infection in the blood

    9. The Intestinal Flora could match many times as long as the Intestines
    are not corrected. 

    10. Lyme has reportedly 165 possible different symptoms. In that way it is
    similar to the Epstein-Barr virus in the mid eighties. I have never found
    any indication that Borreliose is responsible for anything. Even if it is
    found in the blood, it does not mean it is responsible for symptoms. I have
    seen clients where according to blood work there is Borreliose in the
    blood, yet they have no symptoms. The symptoms that people have can be
    there because of many causes. I have always succeeded in treating the whole
    syndrome by focussing on the terrain and not on the bug. All symptoms gone
    without ever using the Lyme nosode. The main purpose is to get the
    meridians in order. 
   
    11. Yes, the Hormone System and Kidneys are the first two layers, that need
    to be corrected first. However, the Intestines can also be treated as the "
    third layer of focus" within the first Session, if there is enough space
    for the nosodes, and especially if you measure Appendicitis (Necroticans).
    Only when the Intestines are healthy the Kidneys will stay clear from
    Intestinal Flora infections.

    12. You should always rely on your hearing and not on the colour
    indications of the Chiren. The Chiren is a computer and needs certain
    parameters and tolerances. The hearing is much more direct and precise, so
    that is what you should rely on. In measurement training it is advised to
    not even look at the Chiren because normally the angle of the probe changes
    when turning the head sideways, causing an immediate drop.

    13. For the undefined points, the physical connection is simply unknown. It
    does not matter for diagnosis or treatment since the remedies often
    indicate what the problem is. Some nail points, however, are defined, and
    important. For example the Appendix point and the Adrenal point.

    14. There are only few practitioners who use the recording system because
    it is too time consuming. Because the Chiren is a computer it needs a fixed
    sequence. In sessions it is often not advisable to follow the fixed system,
    so people use paper. This takes less time, but apparently not according to
    you... 

    15. This could indicate that the Adrenals are totally exhausted. But also
    other reasons should be looked at. For example the remedies that clear the
    Kidneys could also correct the Adrenals. Or other glands or conditions like
    Tonsillitis or Appendicitis. These two conditions can affect them too.
    I suggest that you try other remedies first and keep checking if the
    Adrenals also respond, this could give valuable information.

Tinnitus and Hearing Impairment

    I was not treating a friend, but exploring with her the relationship
    between her gallbladder meridian (Gallbladder has been removed) and the
    tinnitus in her ear.

    In the slots I put the common nosode Gallbladder remedies and then measured
    them against the ear/lymph point on the right hand. The sound results
    indicated a very strong "yes." Whereas, with nothing in the slots the ear/
    lymph drop was not even registering. 

    Somehow, I believe the Gallbladder is related to my friends hearing
    problem, but we'll have to see by treating I guess with  Gallbladder
    remedies?

    For sure the Gallbladder needs to be treated according to your findings,
    but also try to find out if there are factors that might hold the
    Gallbladder back from healing. 

    For example: as long as the Large Intestine an Lymphatic system are not
    healthy they will continue to influence the Gallbladder according to the
    destruction cycle in the  Five Element teaching (Metal destroys Wood)

    Often the Ear Lymphatic point is corrected by (Chronic) Tonsillitis.

    One clients says her hearing is impaired because the tubes are swollen
    closed, not because the hearing itself doesn't work.

    I can't figure why the tubes would be swollen? I have run tonsil remedies,
    and Gallbladder. I thought of circulation, but that doesn't drop. She does
    have a de-fibulator to keep her heart from stopping.

    Probably ought to subit a proper case on her, but just wondered what you
    might think re: swollen ear tubes causing hearing loss?

    Swollen ear tubes can always be found on the Lymphatic meridian…

    Causes can be:
    *Tonsils
    * Food Poisoning
    * Strep/Staph
    * Dental/Jaw problems
    * Whiplash

    Can tinnitus and swollen ear tubes also be caused by cellphone use and EMF
    sensitivity? If so, would causticum be helpful?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    June 2014 edited June 2014 Flag
    There is a huge difference between EMF (electromagnetic field) and Cell
    Phone Radiation (high frequency radiation).

    Cellphones can cause swollen earlobes by boiling the water in the tissue,
    so in theory it can cause other tissues to swell too. However, to get this
    effect the distance between the earlobes and cell phone must be relatively
    small.

    EMF will not have this effect! The magnetic fields (EMF) that are generated
    by cell phones are too small to have such an effect.

    Causticum is a remedy to help with the physical effects of radiation, but
    will not protect against radiation.

    The only way to avoid the effects of cellphone radiation is not to use a
    cellphone anymore! Every body will be influenced by high frequency
    radiation. It has the same effects as a microwave oven and will heat up
    tissue that is exposed to it.


    Tinnitus is a physical pressure problem, caused by a narrow passage in the
    air ducts inside the ear(s).
    I do not think radiation influences/causes this symptom directly, but any
    type of stress can can make the Tinnitus worse.
    Gallbladder remedies are recommended to address all types of stress.

    Heavy metals might be involved, but I am still investigating this. The
    hypothesis is that metals within the body act as antennas for both
    radiation and magnetic fields. 
    But never treat Heavy Metals before the overall functioning of the
    elimination organs has improved enough to deal with them.

Effect Nosodes in Different Programs

    I understand now that nosodes can be used in the Standard Hand Treatment as
    well as in the Footplate Treatment.  

    Questions:
    My understanding is that the nosodes are best utilised in the >12 yrs old
    hand treatment, because of the segmented treatment in which the remedy is
    given in sequences (i.e. a 12C is given for a period of time, then a 30C
    etc.) But during the Dyslexia Treatment the potencies are given all at
    once. Is this not the case? Is my thinking incorrect?  
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    July 2015 edited July 2015 Flag
    First I want to make one distinction between giving remedies and making
    them available.

    If the Chiren would give the remedy and the body is on the receiving end,
    this means that the body will get all information that was put in the
    slots, but this is not the case.

    The Chiren does not give the remedies, it makes them available. Whether the
    body accepts them or not is up to the body. It will only take one potency
    or a remedy if there is a resonance and if it does not cause a new
    disturbance.

    Answer:
    It is true that during the Standard Hand Treatment for adults the
    availability for transfer goes gradually, while in the Footplate treatment
    the body might take all at once. But still it doesn't make a difference
    whether you offer a nosode on the Footplates or during the Hand Treatment.
    Either way, if the body needs it it will take it.

    The Standard Hand Treatment for adults opens the body up for the higher
    frequencies of the light treatment gradually, and then when the program is
    done, the body is ready to accept the light with all frequencies at the
    same time as it is given during the Footplate Treatment. So nosodes on the
    footplates will be readily accepted when needed.

    Thanks, I appreciate your distinction between 'give' and 'make available'. 
    I do understand that and it makes for a better understanding of the
    process.  My question, now, is Why then have the hand treatment in a
    gradual mode and the foot treatment in an 'all at once' mode?  What was the
    thinking behind this difference?

  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    July 2015 edited July 2015 Flag
    Adults have a less flexible energy system than children, and thus need a
    gradual preparation of the body. In a session the Hand rod treatment is
    always given before the Footplate treatment. This way the body is prepared
    to take all information at once when it is time for the Footplate
    Treatment... So there is no need to make steps in this treatment.

Question:
I have not seen him for 2 weeks now but he is planning on coming back since the
symptoms are still there. It seems after every treatment there is improvement
but it does not last. My focus has been on detoxing, parasites, miasms however,
at this point I don't know what else to look for. He is extremely hopeful and
is very excited to come back.

    What I notice is that you seem to have some trouble with measuring... 
    When you measure before the hand treatment, that the remedies you chose
    will correct all dropping points, your measurement after this first hand
    treatment should reflect that. But you seem to still find many drops on the
    same systems that you thought would be corrected...

    Further there are many reasons for foul body odor, it is very hard to
    distinguish a smell through description. But since you feel the smell gets
    worse after eating protein, this might be a clue.... At least it is a
    digestive issue...

    I don't believe that smelling badly is your client's only issue (this never
    comes alone), so please provide a complete picture with all his symptoms so
    we can provide better assistance.

    That the sweating decreases after treatment might be due to your use of
    Tuberculinum (B), this remedy is great for treating the symptom of sweating
    . But we don't just want to treat this symptom we want to get to the Cause
    of the overall condition your client experiences. 
    When there's a problem with sweating there's always a problem with the
    Kidneys too, so you should focus your treatment on the Kidneys as well as
    on the Digestive System.

    Detox will happen automatically when you assist the body to find its
    natural balance. This is done by following the measurement protocol and 
    addressing the eliminatory organs first. 
    Even if there are parasites, they can only live in Intestines (environment)
    that are not healthy at all. Try to match Appendicitis Necroticans or
    Chronic Appendicitis next time you find drops on the Large Intestines. We
    need to focus mainly on the environment and less on the bugs to treat
    effectively...

    Miasms are definitely not something we are very interested in, in
    Biontology. These remedies should be treated in the same way as other
    remedies.

    1. Yes, ideally to find that one perfect remedy to balance all drops on a
    given meridian would be great.  This is my first client and although I am
    finding drops on the same organ meridian on second measurement,  a lot of
    the time it is on a different point.  All points are balanced at the end of
    treatment.

    2. I did not measure for Appendicitis Necroticans or Chronic Appendicitis
    since he did not have many drops on Small Intestine.  I understood this to
    be the correlation for these remedies.  Am I misunderstanding?

    3. I measure/listen very carefully for the kidneys and they have not shown
    up.

    4. Symptoms:
    His Alternative Med Practitioner told him: His body produces a lot of
    mucous (not a symptom he comes up with himself)  
    Odor - since about 12 yrs of age. 
    Seizures - uses meds for this
    No other complaints mentioned, also no complaints about bowel movements.  
    Diet: Organic with fresh vegetables, exercises regularly, sleeps well
   
    On a side note, from researching on the internet, I have learned that
    enzyme deficiencies can cause foul body odor.  Is there anyway to measure
    and correct this using the Chiren?

    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    May 2013 edited May 2013 Flag
    1. Again: When after you've put Remedies in that correct all drops in your
    measurement and then you've treated with them, there should not be any drop
    after treatment if this was done correctly. 
    Very seldom there will be one or two new drops that appear..... but this is
    not common. But I understand this is your first client and measurements
    will always improve over time when you practice a lot, just don't give up ;
    -)
    Only in cases of Hidden Spin Inversion there will be the same drops to
    measure...

    2. A correlation is something that is often there, but not always... So
    never assume that a remedy is not needed in testing. 
    Sometimes even Poliomyelitis comes up a second time for example and if you
    would then assume that you've already treated it you won't be able to find
    the answers....

    3. There are two aspects in the Assessment that are equally important:
    1 = Symptoms
    2 = Measurements
    When the Measurements don't fit the Symptoms you can't just go by these,
    and in that case you'll have to treat the Organ that you know is disturbed
    anyway (although you don't measure this).
    In case of Excessive Sweating there's always a dysfunction of the Kidneys/
    Adrenals so if this doesn't show up in the measurement you still have to
    work on them.

    4. Listen to the symptoms of your client and not to diagnoses of other
    therapists, the more doctors/therapists a person has seen, the more
    diagnoses he/she has.

    Was there anything in his life that happened when he was 11-12 years old
    that made a big impact on him?

    Seizures are not a symptom to overlook! This always indicates Gallbladder
    issues.

    Men usually don't complain about their bowel movement, they think that when
    they have to go every day that that's enough. But when the feces are foul
    smelling (or sticky, or not firm), this in itself is already a sign of bad
    digestion. 

    Enzyme deficiency comes down to a failing digestive tract. You have to find
    out what is going on there. But the Gallbladder Issue alone will influence
    the secretion of Stomach Acid and Pancreatic Enzymes.....

    Did you measure for Whiplash the first time or did you just do the
    treatment? (you should never treat without measuring because you lose
    valuable information).
    In case he did have a Whiplash (for example when he was a kid right before
    his symptoms started..? ;-)) this has had a major effect on his
    Calcium-Metabolism (Kidney+Gallstones!!), his Digestion (Stomach) and his
    Adrenals... All of this would fit his symptoms, but of course it is one of
    the scenarios I can think of... You'll have to look for these answers and
    then treat in a way that deals with the consequences in his body...

    "Smells like “a rotting animal” (own words, not my experience when I see
    him), Smell seems strongest after eating (especially beef)..."
   
    One of the indication for Pyrogenium: any very offensive discharges (
    vomit, sweat, breath, menses,...)
    This nosode is prepared from decomposed beef.
    Maybe it would be worth trying it on Circulation or other meridians.
    Just some thoughts...

    Thanks Irina for your input. 
    This is a good tip, but remember that it is never one remedy that is going
    to solve the problem and that you have to assess the whole situation.
   
    Something is not right with his ability to eliminate... So the Eliminatory
    Organs should have the main focus. Kidneys first because he sweats so much.

Arcon Remedy - Useful?

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
February 2015 edited February 2015 in General Questions Flag
This discussion was created from comments split from: Headaches Associated with
Lyme.

Sandra Levarek:

I have one question concerning Arcons. What was in that remedy. We received
this in one of our very first classes, but I never found out what this remedy
contained. 
I have used it on one client who came from a family of all the women being
raped. From the Grandmother, to her mother, to herself by the grandfather and
to her daughter by her own father.
She was very depressed..She said she wanted this to stop this from happening
again in this generation . Never again to happen to any women in her family. 
And so I thought to try Arcons. We added this to her foot plate sessions. 
She called me the following week and very excitedly she described to me that
for the first time in so many years, she felt like she had the passion to live
again!!  A new lease on life!!
She didn't understand what happened! Neither did I understand exactly what
happened. So I am wondering what exactly is in ARCONS? Could this have been
from the Arcons remedy or simply the sessions she was receiving lifting up some
darkness in her psyche?
Thank you in advance for your reply.

    This is due to the normal treatment and happens all the time to people just
    being treated with the Chiren or Chikey. You cannot place any value on
    that.

    But thank you for asking the big question… "what is this remedy made of?" I
    think there are too many remedies being shared that no one even knows what
    is in it. I have for example seen "black mold" and "Aspergillus" in one
    Chiren at the same time. Aspergillus is a remedy that does come from Johan
    and is also described in the remedy book. It is in fact "black mold".

    The remedy you are writing about was never distributed officially by Johan.
    So how you received it in class I don't know. But maybe you got it from me
    directly, I believe I was present during your training, but not as a
    teacher?

    Anyway, I am the one who created this card when I worked as a flying angel
    in San Francisco, but it is quite useless. At the time I did not realize
    that things would spread like crazy. I only gave it to a few people.
    Some of my "experiments" are still showing up in other peoples' Chirens.
    This one I made because I was interested to see what it would do, since so
    much emphasis was placed on Archons and papers by some practitioners at the
    time. The ingredients are plain paper and ink and they have shown no effect
    in neither Johan's nor my treatments.

    Other useless remedies that I created back then, that I also found out were
    shared with just about anyone are:

    Colostrum => useless because created from powder
    Deer Antler => not homeopathic and I have never seen much effect from it.
    Carcinosinum => made from pellets = not very powerful, and I have found out
    that Carcinoma Mammae is exactly the same.
    Lac Maternum => made from pellets, so also not effective (I am now trying a
    liquid form)

    I would advise to erase these remedies from your Chiren if you have them,
    as they just take up valuable memory space.

    There may be others, because I was trying a lot of things at the time. I
    discarded many remedies after testing them, but it has taught me a lot.
    Johan already knew that liquid remedies that were potentized the
    traditional way were most effective, but he never really told that to
    students or to me before. At least not directly, he often said he had tried
    out many different manufacturers and that homeopathic remedies were
    definitely not all the same…. but I had never heard that remedies should be
    liquid (all that is in the Chiren is made if liquids). When I asked him why
    my "amazing remedies" did not work that well and were so different from the
    standard nosodes in the Chiren he explained it to me. I just wished I had
    known that any sooner… it would have saved me a lot of money I spent on
    homeopathic pellets.

    Right now I am experimenting with over a 100 homeopathic dilutes that are
    made the traditional way, which really does make a difference. Zincum
    Valerianicum and Radium Bromatum were ones that stood out because they gave
    quite dramatic responses in some of my clients. There is one downside to
    Zincum Valerianicum though and that is that it may give a throbbing
    headache sometimes, which happens when the body relaxes too much and then
    overcompensates to correct it. The only times I have seen this, however,
    was when I did not measure Zincum Valerianicum but used it as a support.
    When the remedy IS measured it causes people to deeply relax. Falling
    asleep during treatment, finally giving in to exhaustion and sleeping very
    long are not unusual responses.

    But also many of the dilutes I bought and created are not very useful in
    treatment. That is a real shame, because sometimes the descriptions of
    homeopathics are so poetic and seem so appealing. But well… there is just
    so much involved in finding good quality remedies…

    remedies and that it helps to save memory, too. What about the

    just an exchange between students who already had those remedies… for sure
    it was not Sophie (the teacher at the time) who passed them around. But it
    shows how important it is to ask what the exact origin is of remedies
    before adding them to your Chiren.

Alcoholism/Smoking/Habits

megan_wick
November 2014 edited December 2014 in General Questions Flag
Questions of a client:
1. Can Biontology help with alcoholism/smoking/nail biting/finger cracking.  
2. How do treatments affect bad habits or just habits in general.  
3. Does anyone know if these things are treatable or just able to be helped
through treatments?  
4. What systems would you want to focus on?

    When people are motivated to get rid of their addiction Biontology will
    make it a lot easier, because it eases physical cravings and relaxes the
    underlying tension that causes emotional craving.

    All these addictions you describe are ways to cope with tension/stress,
    which is a Gallbladder issue. Balancing the Gallbladder will relief the
    tension but will not automatically take the habit away, and also new
    tension can be created if there are lifestyle factors that cause them like
    a stressful job or family situation. 

    Often a lot of automatisms that are part of daily functioning are built
    around the addiction too. For example smoking, apart from relieving
    tension, can also create that moment alone that you would otherwise find
    difficult to create time and space for. If that is the case this needs to
    be addressed, and at the same time, other ways of creating that "alone
    time" need to be found. But smoking can also be a social thing, a way to
    give yourself a pose because otherwise you feel insecure… There are as many
    factors that play a role in the habitual side of addiction as there are
    people, and just as with everything else in Biontology, the approach needs
    to be individual and you should ask, ask and ask until your client find the
    answers to break the cycle.

    Motivation is always key. When a husband comes in because the wife has
    pushed him to get rid of his addiction, forget it! It is not going to
    happen then… even though his health and wellbeing will improve and he will
    feel more relaxed, he may want to continue the habit anyway.

    Johan had mentioned in our Basic One class that alcoholism may be due to
    emotional suppression, and that expression would help such clients. Is that
    a possibility?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    Smoking and drinking to alleviate insecurity is also emotional suppression.

    Suppression is a big "umbrella" that all emotional issues can be put under.
    Without suppression there would not be any emotional problem... But
    expression is not the only solution, one also needs to redesign ones life
    (and of course want it!), because the habits around drinking and smoking
    need to be replaced by something else in order to not fall back. Some
    people are more flexible and embrace change easier than others.

Therapy Resistance?

margit
May 2013 edited January 2014 in Therapy Resistance Flag
Client: 61 year old man with balance problems and also in between difficulty
focusing the eyes, for example, it may be necessary to keep a hand on one eye
once in a while when he is driving.

He has aneurysm in the brain which doctors think he might have had his whole
life.
Alcohol enhances his balance problems.

Medication: for urination

He has had 6 treatments and I have followed protocol.

The first time both whiplash and spin-inversion.

He feels no difference although his measurements gets better every time.
I have 2 times given him for therapy resistance.

Question: I have never tried before, that there is
no response after 5-6 treatments. What should I do?

    Hello Margit,

    Please post a proper case review to allow us to see Measurements, Symptoms,
    Remedies, Reactions, Thought Process, Questions.... 

    "following protocol" doesn't tell us anything. Because the protocol only
    shows the order of measurement and which remedies to look for in which
    order.... it doesn't tell us what you've actually been treating and what
    your assessment was.

    Most likely it is not the medication that is the problem, but you might
    have overlooked something. We can not see this if you don't allow us to
    know what you've done.

Hormonal Issues => Hormone System Keeps Dropping

Sharon Werner
September 2014 edited September 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
25 year old woman who came to me for hormonal help.

Symptoms:
Growth of dark facial hair
Weight gain =>her healthy eating and activity pattern haven't change
Periods have stopped

History:
8 years => diagnosed with precocious puberty
12 years => growth potential was reached (she is very short)

Medication:
No medication for the issues when she was young.

Biontology Sessions:
She has had 12 treatments with me.

Measurements:
Every session => almost all points on both hands drop
Half of the sessions => all the points on both feet drop
Half of the sessions => on the feet, mostly points on the Liver, Bladder,
Pancreas and Spleen drop

Treatment:
Whiplash treatment every time => up until the 10th session => it didn't change
the drops so I stopped
Spin Inversion treatment every time => followed by a 2-7 treatment with
Ozaliet, Selenium and Berberis before trying to find matching nosodes => I do
the Spin Inversion treatment after the first measurement

All vaccinations except Yellow Fever => The vaccinations would clear one maybe
two points.
Appendicitis Necroticans, Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis do not clear any
drops
What helps mostly are supports => I have used almost all the supports at least
once

Supports that helped on the Hormone System:
Viscum, Thalamus, Selenium, Berberis, Thyroidea, Procrainium, Ovarium, Hormeel,
Strumeel, Aesculus

Remedies that helped mainly on Gallbladder, Bladder and Kidney:
Cuprum, Plumbum, Mercury, Cystopyelonephritis, Staph Aureus, Chlamdia
Pneumoniae, Staphylococcen, Streptomycinum, Strep Viridans, Tuberculinum,
Amoxilline, Herpes zoster.

Thinking process:
I was thinking that maybe if I balanced her Gallbladder or Bladder, that might
make her Hormone System balance. That doesn't seem to be working either.

Last session:
I treated with Psorinum and Schwefheel not because they resonated with any drop
but because I was hoping there was some sort of therapy resistance going on and
maybe that would take care of it.

Questions:
I really don't know what else to do.
Should I go back to balancing her Hormone System with just supports or should I
try to balance other meridians with nosodes?

    Very strange that all her points drop all the time. I do not have an easy
    solution.
   
    It is imperative that I get more information about: 
    1. Her life style prior to her getting problems with her hormones
    2. A more specific time line
    3. Any reaction to the biophoton sessions (and what remedies used if there
    was a reaction)
    4. How easy is she to measure? (e.g. do you need to press hard, is the skin
    dry/wet/fatty?)
    5. Did you treat scars too?
   
    Further it is difficult to imagine that, especially in the USA, she has
    ever received any medication for the hormonal problems. Were her parents
    against it?
   
    That fact that her periods have now stopped indicates an additional
    Gallbladder problem. This might also be the original problem. 
    Remedies you used there are not the most likely remedies for the
    Gallbladder. Support remedies do not act deep enough to solve the whole
    problem..
   
    Support remedies that might help the hormone system in this situation are
    Hormeel, Gynaecoheel and Klimaktheel

    Psorinum and Schwefheel are used in situations where the drops improve, but
    not the symptoms. In this case there's something that blocks any energetic
    improvement… 

    I hope you have some more information.

    1. Life style (I know the family well)
    Eats very well (not always organically because of cost)
    Little processed foods or sugar
    Drinks a lot of water
    Father was in the military but is retired now
    They live on a small farm
    Very sporadic sleep schedule => I have talked to her about this

    2. Timeline
    * Born prematurely (29 weeks) => genetic testing showed no abnormalities (I
    don't know why they had testing done)
    * Her mother said that they chose not to mediate at age 8 because the side
    effect where too great and the chance of promoting growth too slim so
    obviously they noticed something wrong by that early age
    * No specific life changes were mentioned before or after age 17-18 to
    account for her symptoms. That is why I think it is an issue from birth.
    * Age 17-18 she began growing the facial hair and putting on weight and her
    periods became more irregular and painful
    * Right now periods have stopped all together though last month she did
    have one (which I attributed to Ovarium) => it was not painful but 2 weeks
    long with heavy bleeding
    * She has not had another period and it is now over a month since the last
    one.
    * In the last 2 years, she has graduated college, moved back home, had a
    job for a year
    * Now she is looking for another job
    * She hopes to move out though her parents don't want her to

    Other information
    She does not drive because her parents think that she might be unsafe
    though I am not sure why
    She has no developmental problems other than the above mentioned.
    She is very happy, well adjusted, confident person
    The hormone issue, I believe, is related to whatever has caused her to stop
    growing and the reason for this "precocious puberty" which must have been
    since birth.

    3. Reactions to biophoton treatment
    * Little more energy
    * Mood changes => she was more happy (noticed by her mother)
    * Heavy but painless period => lasted 2 weeks
    * Falling asleep during measurement => stopped, but happened again last
    week
    * 3 headaches over the last 2 months => very unusual for her as she never
    used to get them
    * Dizziness, soreness and tiredness after the fifth treatment => happened
    only once (I supported the Kidneys with Solidago in the 5th treatment, but
    maybe this was not enough)

    Remedies
    I am trying to give you as detailed account as possible without writing out
    every treatment. maybe that is necessary

    First 8 sessions: 
    Supports for the Hormone System
    Vaccination Nosodes
    Some Heavy Metals
    Mostly used remedies: Viscum, Thalamus, Selenium, Berberis, Strumeel,
    Thyroidea, Procranium 
    A little less used remedies: Ovarium, Hormeel, Klimaheel, Atropinum and
    Chelidonium 
    Cuprum was found 5 times on Kidneys and Gallbladder
    I also treated with Cutis
   
    Sessions 7, 8, 10 & 11:
    I measured calculi Billi  
   
    By Session 9 I kind of gave up balancing the Hormone System and started
    focusing on the Bladder and Gallbladder because of her lack of periods.  

    4. Ease of measurement
    I don't have to press too hard 
    Her skin is not dry/wet/fat 
    Her fingers and toes are very small, which makes it somewhat harder to read
    => I sometimes skip one of the first two points (the points closest to the
    nail) in her fingers because the points are just too close together
    My 7 year old has fingers and toes with more room.

    5. Scars 
    She said she had no scars

    Possible doctor's diagnosis
    I doctor friend mentioned (before 2nd to last session) that she could have
    Turner's Syndrome as he thinks she had a lot of symptoms of this syndrome.
    I looked it up and I don't think she quite fits all the symptoms, but I am
    not a medical person.  
   
    Question:
    If she really has Turner's Syndrome, would the Chiren still be able to
    balance her hormones?

    She is coming tomorrow afternoon. I will try all the Gallbladder nosodes
    again and see how her points react to them especially on the Gallbladder
    and Hormone System meridian.

    Thanks for the clarification of Psorinum and Schwefheel. It is very clear
    now to me what therapy resistance is and when to use those two.

    Thank you for helping me with this case. I really want to help her if I
    can.

    Thank you for all information.

    It is good that she has positive reactions to the biophoton treatment. This
    means she is not therapy resistant. It is curious that symptoms continue to
    improve, but almost all points keep dropping…  

    The symptoms indeed match Turners syndrome but the question is why does she
    have it? The medics say it is genetic. IF it really is, you should perhaps
    also involve her parents.

    Questions:
    1. Has she or her mother been exposed to a farm chemicals?
    In Holland it is known that a lot of people that are exposed to these
    agricultural chemicals get hormonal problems. One third of the woman become
    infertile, get miscarriages, etc.
    2. Where in her head are the headaches? Are they frontal, on the sides or
    on top of the head? The location tells you everything about the cause. 
    (look at the meridian that runs there)

    If she has been exposed to farm chemicals you can ask her if it is possible
    for her to get hold of them. Then you can make inverted remedies of them
    with the neutralization program and test them. This way you can see what
    organs they have affected. If positive you can treat with them. 
    If you don't measure them you can still treat with them => use the 2-7
    years program. But be very careful. Do not use many toxins at the same
    time.

    Thank you for your help Johan.  The more I treat people, the more I realize
    how little I know.

    Her parents know about the possibility of her having Turner's syndrome.  I
    think that my client and her parents are waiting to see what happens with
    these sessions before looking to other things.  I am not sure what I can
    say the Chiren can do if she does have Turner's.

    1.  Farm Chemicals
    No chemicals are used on or around their farm.

    2. Headaches
    I knew I should have said where the pain was - it is on the side so I
    believe that is the Gallbladder meridain.  That is one of the reasons I
    started focusing on the Gallbladder.

    Other Information:
    I forgot to mention that the last 2 sessions she has had a reaction. 
    During these 2 sessions she was given Herpes Zoster for the first time.
     
    After the 11th session (she has now had 13)
    she developed little red, itchy bumps on her hand and a dry cough 

    After the 12th session,
    the bumps were still on her hand but had also developed on her elbows. 
    they look like pimples and were obviously itchy because she kept scratching
    during the session. 
    still had cough

    She came again yesterday and the pituitary, parathyroid and 5 of the left
    hand Small Intestine points didn't drop!  The Pineal and Thyroid did,
    though, as well as almost every other point on the hand.  The feet were
    mostly dropping.  I funny thing happened, though.  I put in:

    Viscum - cleared the Pineal
    Thalamus - cleared the Thyroid
    Sutoxol and Hepar - cleared the Lymphatic System
    Ovarium - cleared the sex gland on Hormone System

    Then when I checked the feet, those supports cleared the Gallbladder,
    Bladder and Kidney!  Does that make sense?

    Question:
    1.  Could there be a connection with the herpes and bumps/cough or am I
    just not supporting her kidneys well enough (though I am sure when she
    leaves that no Kidney point is dropping)?  But maybe could it be that these
    symptoms are showing that disturbances are being addressed (by allowing
    hidden problems to come to the surface)?   I feel like I am making her
    worse with the bumps, cough and headaches and not helping because she still
    has the facial hair, weight gain and no period.

    2.  Should she be tested to see if she does have Turner's syndrome before I
    do any more treatments?  Or can the Chiren possibly help with some of the
    issues so I should just keep treating her and see how much benefit she can
    get?

    PS
    I apologize for not putting my previous post in the correct format and
    thank whoever took the time to correct my negligence.  I hope I did it
    correctly this time.

    Sharon,

    How wonderful that this young woman has you working so hard to make her
    body feel better. I can certainly see the caring and attention you are
    giving her in your work.

    I think Johann is on to something when he asks about farm chemicals.
    However, didn't you say she grew up in a military family? And did they
    travel and live from base to base?

    I'm wondering about chemicals/radiation from childhood that thwarted her
    hormonal system from childhood, even perhaps altering the epigenetics of
    her DNA?

    How could we find out about chemical/radiation exposures from her childhood
    before the farm? Would it matter to this case? Could a pathogen picked up
    in a foreign country or lab. leak cause all these problems too?

    This is a very good case Thank you for submitting it. I look forward to
    learning more. Barbara

    The appearance of "bumps" on the skin, indicates that you might have
    activated a disturbance or that the body tries to get rid of something.

    There is something we call in Holland "gall bumps", they can come up at any
    time and then disappear again. The bumps your client is experiencing might
    be those gall bumps. If they suddenly appear it would mean that there has
    been a lot of suppression that the treatment is in the process of
    eliminating the suppression. If this is the case the Gallbladder and Liver
    need to be treated.

    The bumps could also be something like chicken pox or small pox. For this
    you can try Variolinum or Varicellen. These diseases often disturb the
    hormonal glands.

    It does not seem that the bumps are an excretion.

    I think you are doing good work on your client as all kinds of things that
    were suppressed are coming to the surface. I suggest you keep treating her
    but focus more.
  • 
    Sharon Werner
    September 2014 edited October 2014 Flag
    Thank you again Johan.  I will keep working with her as long as she will
    come.  I will also tell her what you said about suppression.  That is what
    I was hoping was happening.  That gives me hope and some relief too.  Also,
    I will focus more because I do seem to be bouncing around, trying to treat
    everything at once.  I will focus on the Gallbladder since I really feel
    this is a main problem.

    Barbara - thank you for your input (and encouragement). The family never
    lived out of the states but has moved a lot.  I don't know what kind of
    chemicals a military family would be exposed to, though.  I know from her
    childhood she had surgery for ear tubes and they did other tests though I
    don't know what those are.  Therefore, I checked for Causicum but since I
    don't have my client's charts right in front of me I can't remember if it
    resonated.

    If any amazing breakthrough happens, I will give an update.  Until then we
    will keep plugging along.

    I'm back again with a question regarding this client.

    Here are my last two sessions with her:

    Session 13

    Measurement:
    almost every point dropping but not the Pituitary or Parathyroid gland

    Treatment:
    Whiplash => did not correct one point

    >12 Years Program:
    Herpes Zoster 

    Footplates:
    Lymphatic System => Tonsilla Compositum, Mercurisheel, Sutoxol, Hepar 
    Lungs => Aspergillus 
    Triple Warmer => Ovarium, Viscum (Pineal)
    Large Intestine => Diverticulose, Mucosa, Graphites (because I didn't know
    what the bumps on her 
    hands were yet)
    Small Intestine => Berberis
    Kidneys => Solidago 
    Thyroid => Thalamus 
    Gallbladder => Chelidonium 
    Syzygium

    Viscum and Thalamus - cleared Pineal and Thyroid, Galbladder, Bladder and
    Kidney

    Session 14
    Measurement:
    Almost every point dropping (also Pituitary and Parathyroid), but Cerebral
    point on arteries not dropping and she has a lot more energy so didn't do a
    Spin Inversion treatment.

    >12 Years Program: 
    Galbladder => Cholecystitis 
    Large Intestine => Appendicitis, Tonsillitis, Formaldehyde
    Bladder => Tonsillar Compositum, Hormeel, Ovarium
    Aesculus

    Footplates:
    Pituitary, Parathyroid => Thalamus, Viscum, Cerebrum 
    Pineal =>Berberis 
    Thyroid => Thyroidea 
    Galbladder => Chelidonium, Injeel Chol

    Viscum, Thalamus, Cerebrum, Berberis, Chelidonium => cleared Pituitary,
    Parathyroid and most Galbladder, Bladder and Kidney points

    Question:
    I find it funny that I have to keep using supports such as Viscum, Thalamus
    and Cerebrum and don't find nosodes.

    1. By using these support, can whatever is the problem with her Triple
    Warmer be healed or do I need to find a nosode? Could there be a
    disturbance that just needs supports to be treated?

    2. If she did have a problem such as Turner's Syndrome could supports such
    as these keep coming up as being needed by the body? Could the fact that I
    keep measuring them be an evidence to having a chromosomal abnormality? In
    other words, would you expect a person with a chromosomal admormality to
    constantly need these type of suppports?

    3. I don't understand why these supports keep clearing up the Bladder,
    Kidney and Gallbladder completely or at least mostly. What is the
    connection?

    Thank you again for any help you can give me.
    Sharon

US Chiren Problems - Break Through!

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
November 2014 edited July 2015 in H.A.A. Messages Flag
In the US we have been dealing with several Chirens that were sent to Schwab
for repair with the following issue:
The touch screen suddenly switched off and could not be restarted immediately.
So the Chiren seemed broken. However, when the Chiren arrived at the San Ramon
office or sometimes in Germany there was no problem detectable, the Chiren
switched on as normal.

After a long search for answers Schwab has finally found what the problem is
that caused the so called "back light" issue and has also found the solution.
As we already suspected, the problem lies indeed the American electricity
network, which is notoriously unstable. Because of the above ground cables it
is sensitive to all external influences.

Surge protectors won't prevent the problem, since it is not the voltage that is
the culprit. What happens in the US frequently is current interruptions of a
fraction of a second. This interruption is enough for the Chiren to shut down. 
Because it then does not have the time to properly wind down, it cannot find
the way back soon enough. Every time, when the Chiren arrives at Schwab, it
functions normally so over time it restores itself again.

To avoid these things from happening again, Schwab has found two devices that
make available an uninterrupted power supply. Both are available at Radioshack.
I strongly advise United States practitioners not to operate the Chiren without
it.

Uninterruptible power supply 1

Uninterruptible power supply 2

My husband and I both have a cold. 

Measurement:
All points dropping.

Treatment:
Spin Inversion
Ozaliet

Results:
Nothing changed after these treatments, so all points still dropped...

Questions:
I have no clients today, I can't see what's happening with other people but it
is a strange thing I never saw before.
Is there a hugh solar storm goiing on? 
Can there be an other reason?

    My experience:
    I treat all of my 6 children (both adult and younger) + spouses, whenever
    they start having some symptoms of an illness going around.
    The results are excellent over the entire winter season with remaining
    healthy or regaining their health quickly.
   
    Observation:
    Most of the time, when they are actually becoming sick or have merely been
    exposed, all or most points are disturbed and dropping. 

    Treatment:
    Different things matched at different times, when illnesses are going
    around. 
   
    But these are some of the things I have started with when they have felt
    ill: 
    Coxackie A9 & B4, Febris Wolhynica, Brucella Abortus Bang, Food Poisonings,
    all Staph & Strep, all Tonsillitis, Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Otitis Media,
    Meningococcum, Scarlatinum, Pertussis, Medorrhinum, Malaria, Morbillinum, Q
    Fever, Pfeiffer. 
   
    You can also measure for Supports: 
    Belladonna, Bryaconeel, Veratrum, Natrium Hommacord, China, Coenzyme &
    Ubichinon, Echnacea, Engystol, Galium, Lymphomyosot, Mucosa, Sinusitis,
    Phosphor, Tonsillar Comp, and Vomitusheel.

    Comments:
    Always measure for the disturbing factor to balance the points and then
    give good support. 
    Don't forget Circulation, Kidneys and Liver and drinking lots of water to
    flush everything out quickly.

    This has worked quite well for each of them and they are true believers.
    Most of the time when we have caught it soon enough, they haven't even
    gotten sick and are feeling great by the next morning, but the times that
    they have come down with something, it has cleared their bodies very
    quickly.

    When all points are dropping, I immediately look for Tonsillitis and/or
    Appendicitis 
    All Appendicitises and Tonsillitises (chronic or acute) can make all points
    drop. 

    But certain Radiation, such as Solar Storms, can have the same effect. In
    your case it is not the Solar Storms causing the problem directly, since
    this will give Aura problems  (and sometimes Spin Inversion) and Ozaliet
    will correct this.
    Radiation can also make certain Bacteria active, so indirectly it might
    have been Solar Storms that caused all points to drop by causing/
    aggravating infections.

    There can be current Solar Storms or Flares but do keep in mind that also
    the cumulative effect of Solar Radiation can at one time be too much.

    What is indicated on the spaceweather website is the Quantity.  
    The Quality can not be measured, it can only be experienced.

    For the effects of Radiation you can try Causticum.

    Also keep in mind the difference between Steep drops (energetic - can be
    Solar Flares) and Slight drops (physically manifested - can be
    infections). 

    And another comment... Sometimes when you are very exhausted/ill during
    exposure to a strong EM field it is very difficult to correct a Spin
    Inversion....

    Questions:
   
    1) So are the contagious illnesses that go around caused by the
    disturbances with EMF?

    2) Am I just symptom treating with matching the Virus or Bacteria and I
    should first try just Appendicitis, Tonsillitis or Causticum first?

    3) Should we always be checking the Solar Storm website or just be checking
    for Spin or Causticum first when clients all or almost all drops and have
    symptoms of illness?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    June 2013 Flag
    Ronda:

    1) There are always several factors in play when one gets ill... 
    If you look at a causal level, it is always ones overall condition (Energy,
    Immune System, Aura) that determines how one deals with the environmental
    factors that one is exposed to...

    These environmental factors can be:
    Parasites, Bacteria, Viruses => are opportunistic and will only cause
    illness in a weak body (can also be already latently present in the body)
    Solar Storms/EMF/Radiation => weakens the Aura and defences, seems to
    activate latent infections
    Draining Situations/People => Lack of Energy and Stress weakens the Immune
    System
    Something else....?
   
    A healthy individual will rarely be ill, whatever is "going around".

    2) When all/many points drop slightly, test with the Appendicitises and/or
    Tonsillitises first because these reflect an Underlying Chronic
    Inflammatory Condition that makes one Vulnerable for Infections.
    When all/many points drop steeply, there is an energetic (Aura) problem and
    you have to look for that. First try Ozaliet, then Spin Inversion.... 
    Causticum is low potency and deals with the physical effects of Radiation.
    So this is not the remedy to test with an energetic problem.

    3) See the answer to your second question...When you find that there's an
    Energetic problem like Spin Inversion, or weak/absent Aura it might be
    necessary to find out what is the trigger and then checking Space Weather
    is an option. If the Solar Storms are not the factor that initiated the
    Aura problem/Spin Inversion, you'll have to look at other EMF/Radiation
    factors in the Clients life.

March 2015 - Mammogram, Solar Panels, Leg Extension

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Q&A Flag
Question 1
Some women ask me how important to go for annual tests of mammogram and pap
smear.
How necessary and how often these tests need to be done?

Johan's Answer
Mammograms are painful and can actually be causal in the CREATION of tumours.
Offcial investigations have confirmed this. 
What I have seen is that pap smears are totally unreliable. I would forget
about it. The pap smear itself is not harmful, but false positives may cause a
lot of distress.

Question 2
Do solar panels on the roof of the house create any unwanted fields, and effect
the health of people indoor?

Johan's Answer
The panels themselves do create some weak fields, but not strong enough to
affect anybody. 
The batteries that are linked up to the panels could be more damaging. I have
no idea about the fields they create so cannot say more about this. I would be
careful with the location of these batteries though.

Question 3
One client has low back pain. I would like to try leg treatment protocol. It is
important to figure out what leg is shorter.
Could you please explain how exactly to measure the difference in lengths of
the legs? I find it difficult and not accurate.

Answer
1. Lay the client down on the floor. 
2. Ask them to pull up their knees a few times. 
3. Then place your hands round their ankles with the thumbs on the inner side. 
4. Now you can easily determine which leg is longer.

Question 4
Client who had number of treatments. Many points cleared, but Gallbladder
points were consistently dropping for the last three treatments.
Gallstones points never dropped.
Could we correct the other Gallbladder points with Calculi Bil, Calculi Renalis
besides the Gallstones points?
For the last sessions drops were corrected by Biliary Cirrhosis, Cholecystitis,
supported with Chelidonium, Atropinum, Berberis.
But the following visit there were again same drops on Gallbladder.
The reason I placed few times the same nosodes and supports because I was
thinking that Gallbladder (its infection/inflammation) probably requires some
healing time. Or do I have to apply different remedies if I see the same drops
in the following visit? Like in this case... try Liver nosodes?
How long each remedy (nosode/bacteria/virus) has to work? Let say Zirrohose
Hepatis fixed the drops this time. If next time the same drop will reappear
shall I use something else?
Is a single application of the remedy enough to address the suspected issue?

Answer
It all depends wat "a number of treatments" means and how many layers were
already balanced. If there is a continuous measurement of Biliary Cirrhosis,
and there are hardly any drops anymore on the other systems (especially no
drops on Hormone System and Kidneys), you might create a breakthrough by trying
to measure Zirrhose Hepatis or other Liver nosodes to see if they match. 
With the organ affection nosodes, the following visit you can still find the
same remedy but the third visit I would definitely start looking for different
nosodes.
Liver cirrhosis is a chronic condition, so it might need more treatments. Often
this nosode is followed by the Hepatitis nosodes. But whenever you focus on the
Liver you should always give it heavy support.

    Maybe Adenomyose Gallenblase will match
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    April 2015 Flag
    Adenomyose Gallenblase in itself is not a functionally disturbing factor
    that will effect many parts of the body. It will for example hardly ever
    cause the Diabetic (Insulin Low) point to drop like Cholecystitis and
    Billiary Cirrhosis will do. 

    Adenomyomatosis is more of a structural change in the Gallbladder that may
    be caused by chronic inflammation of the Gallbladder, but is not a cause
    itself. So this can never be the cause of a continued need for
    Cholecystitis/Billiary Cirrhosis nosode (the adenomyomatosis will not cause
    continued inflammation!). 

    This is also shown by the fact that this remedy is not needed (measured)
    that much and usually does not have much effect on what we call
    "Gallbladder symptoms". When Adenomyose Gallenblase actually is measured it
    is mostly on one or two drops and the other drops are corrected by Billiary
    Cirrhosis and/or Cholecystitis, which are also present.

    Liver problems, however, CAN hold the Gallbladder back from healing
    sometimes. If nothing else matches on the Gallbladder, Liver nosodes may be
    measured. 
     But only treat the Liver when the body is ready for it. If there are still
    many higher ranked layers showing drops they need attention first.

Fluid in the Lungs ..

slevarekslevarek
May 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
Young woman who I've been seeing for quite some time.. 
She is off the dialysis now and performs the dialysis now using a peristaltic
 pumps in her own home.

Symptoms: 
Kidney Failure (Dialysis.. etc) 

Current situation:
Seemed like she was doing well
Had to go to the hospital for "Fluid in the Lungs" twice in the last 3 months,
she wants to see me again for this and also for High Blood Pressure.

Questions:
1. What might be the cause of the fluid in the lungs..? 
2. How should I treat the High Blood Pressure..? 
3. Last visit all her points were up.. no drops.. her Kidney points were all
good.. her Gallbladder good, her Triple Warmer meridian.. excellent.. 
So I am kind of wondering what I am missing.. or where I should be focusing
on...

    Session
    Client:
    Woman with Fluid in her Lungs

    Medical Interventions:
    Was in hospital March of this year, because she was not able to breath, had
    fluid in the Lungs etc.
    A "tube" was put in her Heart for some reason....

    Measurement & >12 year Treatment:
    Triple Warmer - OK

    Lungs - Staphylococcus Aureus, Belladonna
    Heart
    Nervous System - Fibroma Pendulum, Engystol
    Large Intestines
    Circulation/Veins - Atropinum, Mellilotus
    Liver - Carcinoma Hepatis, Hepar

    In the manual I saw the Heart/Lung combination indicated possible Infection
    with Strep, Staph or Coxsackie. Only Staph resonated...

    After the Standard Hand Treatment all points were balanced.
   
    Footplate Treatment:
    I put kidney support remedies.. Solidago, Populus, Calm&Clear

    Why do you treat the Liver in the 1st Session? This is not recommended.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    May 2013 edited January 2014 Flag
    Peter: I don't believe this "1st session" of Sandra was a true 1st session
    since she has been treating this client for some time.....
   
    Sandra: If your client has severe Liver issues like you have measured this
    can also cause Fluid Build-Up in the Lungs (Pulmonary Edema) and the Liver
    issues can also be the cause of the High Blood Pressure. Especially since
    you measured Atropinum on the Circulation. This shows that the Cause of the
    High Blood Pressure lies in the cramping of the Vessels which correlates
    with Gallbladder/Liver problems....
   
    I feel that in this situation the Gallbladder/Liver need a lot of attention
    and support.... while at the same time you keep supporting the Kidneys too
    of course. Don't forget to treat the Organ Systems in the right order
    though.

    Kidney failure can also be caused by the High Blood Pressure. Does your
    client have Diabetes?

    To confirm:
    I have been treating this woman since last year, she got off of dialysis in
    November.. 
   
    Unfortunately she flew to Sydney, were she contracted a Staph infection
    (through the dialysis tube which was still connected to her). In the States
    she spent a week in the hospital. There they diagnosed Staph in her Heart
    and a Lung Infection. 
    Because of this experience a decision was made to change the method of
    dialysis. Now she uses a Peristalsis Pump.
    However in March she again ended up in the hospital with Fluid in her Lungs
    and Staph in the Blood.. 
   
    This last visit was 6 weeks from when I saw her last.. 
    She again had this difficulty in breathing.. 
   
    My measurements showed drops on:
    Lungs,
    Heart,
    Liver
    No other drops! (cleared in previous sessions, I was communicating much
    with Johan at that time.. he told me to keep up the Kidney support
    remedies.. which I have been doing) 
   
    Overall .. she seems very healthy.. and the points I found dropping were
    the heart, lung, liver, circulation. 
    She does not have diabetes. I will keep in mind the support remedies on the
    Liver and Gallbladder..

    The diabetes I was wondering about since the combination of Hypertension
    that is caused by Gallbladder imbalance (you have proven this by measuring
    Atropinum on the Circulation) and Kidney Disease is often seen in
    Diabetes.... 
    Johan also wonders if she is Overweight, since this alone puts a lot of
    strain on the Circulation..?

    Don't forget the Adrenals... I would use Selenium as a support every time,
    since the Potassium in this remedy will help to lower Blood Pressure and
    also help the Heart to function better.

    Client feels much better since last session where there is no the problem
    of the lungs.. breathing issues.. fluid etc.. Feels so so much better with
    energy etc.

    However, a blood test showed her Red Blood Cell count is Low.

    Answers to questions:
    She is not diabetic or overweight.
    She is slim, very fit, looks incredibly healthy.
    For the first time in a year she took a job last month that she had to quit
    after just 1 week due to her legs swelling.. from standing all day.

    Questions:
    1. What can you advise me I should focus on when I see her tomorrow?. I
    will be sure to give Support remedies.. for the Adrenals.
    2. What causes the Red Cell Count to be low? or rather what should I look
    for in Particular?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    1 & 2 The combination of Edema and Low Red Blood Cell count is a strong
    indication for Kidney trouble. Kidneys excrete the hormone EPO
    (erythropoietin) to stimulate the production of Red Blood Cells in the Bone
    Marrow. Kidney failure can cause low Red Blood Cell count.
    And then the combination with the Edema.... So you definitely have to
    continue to focus on the Kidneys and Adrenals.

    Session... June 27th

    Client:
    25 year woman who is on peristalsis dialysis. 
    She looks very healthy, and has a beautiful, slim, yet muscular body.  

    Current situation:
    Just had a test (blood count, kidneys etc.)
    Hemoglobin count = 6 (supposed to be 11-14) ==> doctor wants to give here
    Epogen 550 MG
    Kidney Function (glomerular filtration rate) = 27%
    High Blood Pressure
    She gives herself 1 dialysis per day (3-4 is suggested)
    She was supposed to go into the hospital yesterday for blood transfusions..
    but didn't go.

    Symptoms:
    Self administered dialysis results in "fluid in the lungs", and inability
    to sleep all night. So she tries to do it in the morning.
    Client suspects the fluid in her lungs is caused by the "dextrose" in the
    fluid used for dialysis.
    She is bruising a lot these days. 
    She mainly feels well except when she had a bad night sleep because of the
    dialysis (dextrose?) and then she's tired.

    Measurement:
    No Spin Inversion or Whiplash (never measured either one in the last 5
    months)

    Drops on:
    Gallbladder
    Kidney
    Liver
    Lungs

    >12 Year Program:
    Billary
    Cirrhosis, Galium, Reneel, Ubichinon, Populus, Solidago, Melilotus, Coenzyme

    Footplate Treatment:
    Ozaliet, Thalmus, Viscum, Selinium, Belladonna

    No drops after treatment.

    Results:
    After every treatment she sleeps well and feels great.
    Then after a dialysis her sleeps gets disrupted again and her lungs act up.
    It is a vicious cycle.

    Questions:
    1. When would it be good to stop dialysis?
    She is ready to quit her dialysis, but her tests are showing that the
    Kidneys are not functioning totally up to the level they should be. 
   
    2. She doesn't want to use Epogen since the side effects are exactly what
    she experiences.
    What can we do to get the low Red Blood Cell count back to normal?

    3. Am I missing something?

    I think you are not getting to the Cause. My guess is that there is an
    Infection involved. What about the Lymphatic System?

    I see that you only used 1 Nosode (Billiary Cirrhosis) in total and
    that you have addressed neither Lungs nor Liver.
   
    I think you need more focus on the Gallbladder.

    Have you tested Strep-Staph on Kidneys? 

    I would have given Berberis as a Support too.

    Infections on the Lung ==> she measured for Staph several times over the
    past year. The recurring Staph started when she began dialysis. This last
    session it was not a match however.

    Belladonna did match (drops gone) 

    Galium matched on the Liver, so I did address that.

    I will keep Berberis in mind for the next session.... and test again for
    infections on the kidney and Gallbladder.

    No other drops than what I mentioned above were found.

    Have you tried Chlamydia Pneumoniae on the Lungs (or Kidneys)? Sometimes
    this is the underlying cause for recurring Staph-Strep infections.

    Belladonna is a Support for inflammation in general, but it doesn't treat
    the Cause.

    What about Teeth problems? Especially her 2x4 incisors?

    Client:
    Young woman 24 yrs old, first started treatment a year ago when she started
    Dialysis. Her goal is to get off dialysis and she believes she can do it.. 
    I help her without charging as she does not have the money, and I am
    learning so much from working with her. 
    After many sessions she appeared pretty healthy.. and I have not seen her
    in a while. 
   
    Rachel came to me again when extreme swelling happened with legs.. 

    Symptoms:
    She looks healthy and most of the time she feels healthy..
    Urinated 4oz per day => now it is approximately 6-8 oz per day (normal is
    about 4 cups a day) 
    High blood pressure => since last session, over the last year
    Fast Heartbeat at night
    Coughing,
    Spitting phlegm,
    Hard to breath, Tightness in chest (at night)
    In January she did not menstruate => Cycle was regular before Blood
    Transfusion

    Medical History:
    We got her off the dialysis in 2012..
    Then a tube in the chest => caused Staph infection of Lungs and Heart =>
    dialysis was started again.
    Presently using "Peritoneal" dialysis => home dialysis
    Blood Test (December) => Low Hemoglobin (always low) => Blood Transfusion
    => values afterward were perfect => Now her counts are low again => she
    needs another Transfusion...
    Blood Test (December) => Parathyroid (Calcium) levels too high => Doctor
    wants to remove the Parathyroid => but the Parathyroid never drops in my
    measurements….
    Blood Test (December) => Potassium too low, Phosphorus too high = Kidney
    dysfunction
    TB shot last week =>1 every year is required they say!!

    Medication:
    Uses "LOSARTAN" on and off (to avoid dependency) => prescribed for High
    Blood Pressure => right now she doesn't use it or any other prescription
    drugs

    LOTARSAN side effects:
    - Potassium Imbalance (she has these, and they are the big concern of her
    doctors)
    - Kidney issues, including Kidney failure! => I am just amazed...

    Neutralization Program with LOSARTAN => helped with the swelling => Lung
    issue begins once again => doctor told her to take the medication again, so
    she did.

    Measurements:
    No Spin Inversion => She never had one during a visit.
    No drops on the Hormone System
    No drops on the Kidneys

    >12 year Program:
    Circulation => Atropium, Mellitosus, Circulo
    Lungs => Chlamydia Pneumoniae
    Bladder => Cantharis
    Liver => Biliary Cirrhosis
    Support => Albumoheel, Belladona

    2nd Measurement:
    No drops

    Footplates:
    Berberis, Ozaliet, Aesculus, Populus, Solidago, Apis

    3rd Measurement:
    No drops

    Observation and Questions:
    1. The blood test indicates Parathyroid dysfunction, but Parathyroid does
    not drop, however her Circulation does and shows Calcium issues

    2. The blood test indicates Kidney failure (high phosphorus, low
    Potassium), but the Kidneys never drop

    3. The Meridians that I continue to measure drops on are: 
    Gallbladder, Circulation, Liver, and Lungs..

    4. What am I missing here?  I welcome any advice as I feel somewhat at loss
    to getting her off the dialysis.. 
    I just believe there must be a way we can get her off the dialysis...
    Thanks in advance for any feedback.

    5. Could the required TB vaccination be the cause of her Lung issues?

    Answers:

    1. & 2. When Measurements do not give drops, this indicates that on the
    Information/Biophoton level the organs are in good functioning order again.
    Or that there's suppression.
   
    * There seems to be suppression, since the blood tests still show hormonal
    issues and in your measurements they don't drop. There must be
    malfunctioning of the Hormonal Glands. 

    * When on the other hand the Information level is corrected, but the
    Physical Organ does not respond this can mean that:
    a. There's a therapeutic block => treat with Psorinum and Schwefheel
    b. If I use the analogy of a car => the car is perfect, but has no gas

    Kidney disease is often caused by Adrenal insufficiency.
    Potassium is like the gas of the car, and the blood work shows a lack of
    it.
    However, in Kidney diseases the use of Potassium is normally
    contra-indicated.

    There might be an absorption issue of Potassium by the body. The Potassium
    might be bio-unavailable, which means that the body can not get to the
    Potassium although it is there => this is typical for Spin Inversion

    The elevated Calcium level => the Calcium in the Blood might take up to 8
    treatments to be cleared after the Parathyroid function is corrected.

    4. The Hormonal Glands still have issues.Your measurements of the Hormonal
    System show no drops => since there are still hormonal issues, you cannot
    trust your measurement.
   
    Did you treat the Vaccinations in the beginning? Sometimes the Vaccinations
    are not cleared after one treatment because:
    * the right order of treatment was not followed, 
    * there was an overdose of Treatments/Remedies, 
    * other modalities were used at the same time, 
    * or issues like Scars and Spin Inversion were overlooked.
   
    The rest of the Symptoms indicate Gallbladder issues.

    5. The TB vaccination might be the cause of her Lung issues, but I think it
    is more the Gallbladder. The vaccination might have aggravated the
    Gallbladder issue though.

    February 2014 edited February 2014 Flag
    3. You continue to measure: Liver, Gallbladder, Circulation, and Lungs

    * The Liver and Gallbladder problem might very well be the underlying cause
    of the Kidney issue, since the Kidneys themselves don't show up in
    measurement anymore. 

    * In dialysis the Circulation is always a problem, since pressure is put on
    the Veins and Arteries by this procedure. So Circulatory issues are more of
    a Consequence than a Cause, so I would just run some support to assist
    their healing, but focus on Liver and Gallbladder.

    * Fluid in the Lungs is also a common side effect of dialysis.

Treating patients that are on Cortison

We were taught that when clients are on Cortison it masks the body and must be

    No, this doesn't make sense if they're still taking it.

    I never neutralize medication that clients are still using (and never
    did). 

    You can just treat through Cortison with good results. It only takes
    longer: Cortison impaires the regulation system of the body and what we
    need for treatment to work is good regulation. 
    You have to multiply the amount of treatments needed by 3 if a client uses
    Cortison.
    (Neutralizing Cortison in the treatments won't reduce the amount of
    treatments needed!)
   
    Sometimes the body can be blocked because of many drugs for a long time.
    Cortison won't do this by itself.
    (Neutralizing drugs to get rid of a block like this doesn't work either,
    the physical is just not capable anymore to react on the energetic
    change). 
   
    Another thing is that medication almost never masks. The only medication
    that I know of that masks is Morphine. Other medication can have
    side-effects or delay effects, but they don't masks things.

    The advise with medication is first to get rid of the cause of the
    symptoms, that the drug is taken for, and then to reduce it and see if it
    can be stopped.

    Never advise to stop Cortison if it is used for a severe infection.
    Cortison is always used to relief symptoms and you have to get rid of the
    underlying cause of these symptoms first before you reduce the Cortison,
    otherwise you can create very severe flare ups.

    As a qualified Naturopath I know what cortison does to the body, cortison
    should never be stopped without medical control.

    Hi Johan
    Would you look for Appendicitis (Acute, Chronic, Necroticans) on Large
    Intestines, Small Intestines, Pancreas Gallbladder and Liver ?

    Hi

    If there are many points dropping, then the first indication is
    Appendicitis and/or Tonsillitis. I first try Appendicitis Necroticans. If
    it does not match or does not match all the points on the Large Intestine,
    then I also try Chronic Appendicitis to see if it brings balance to the
    rest of the intestinal points. if points on the Lymph meridian are
    dropping, I first would try the Chronic Tonsillitis

    I do the support remedies not instead of the Tonsillitis/Appendicitis, but
    in addition after I have treated with the nosodes. I do not test with the
    support remedies. I put in the support in the Dyslexia treatments, when all
    points have balanced during the standard treatment. If the standard
    treatment does not balance out all points, I still use one or two nosodes
    in the Dyslexia treatment. The rest of the slots I then use for support for
    those organs that need it.

    This is really helpful in that it directs us to where to begin when there
    are so many drops.  Thank you Johan for your response with specific
    directions as to which nosodes are checked for which meridians.

    Johan,

    I'm trying to unlearn/relearn some things here & use the best approach, so,
    for clarification, would you say that in most cases, you now only select &
    treat with one (Appendicitis Nec, Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicitis)?
   
    However, "sometimes" treating with both Appendicitis Nec & Chronic
    Appendicitis is okay as in your example above, is that right?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    February 2013 Flag
    You only treat what you measure. Chronic Appendicitis is the only
    exception. Then I put in acute Appendicitis to prevent a flare up. 
    Sometimes you measure the need for two Appendicitis remedies but usually
    not.

    Hi Johan,

    So correct me if I'm wrong, when one measures appedicitis necroticans, that
    is the only one to put in the slot?
    One does not add chronic app. and app. with the together in de treament
    when you measure app. necroticans?

    Hi Johan,

    Just to clarify. When we measure Appendicitis Necroticans, we treat with it
    and no other Appendicitis. But if we measure a match with Chronic
    Appendicitis then we could put in Appendicitis Necroticans??

    Maybe you should rewrite the Appendix / Tonsils protocol in another
    discussion? As Robin says to better un/relearn.... as we've had another
    protocol about this in the course. 
    It is all about clearing up and put things right, as you intend to do,
    Johan. Thanks.

    Hi Jennifer,

    If you measure Chronic Appendicitis and it matches this means that you
    don't need Appendicitis Necroticans, but might need Acute Appendicitis. I
    always put this in to prevent the chronic condition from becoming acute.

    hi Johan,

    I would like to know more about what you said about "to prevent the chronic
    condition from becoming acute"with Appendicitis. Does this mean we always
    have to put that after measering a chronic appendicitis? is this the same
    for tonsillitis? I would like to have some information about prevention or
    at least to understand how the chiren can work on the body so we know that
    old complains/pains/etc. can come back for a short period? is this within
    the 3 days after treatment, or can endure longer.? Thanks

    Hi Mariette,

    Acute appendicitis can be life threatening and may show up as Chronic
    Appendicitis begins to clear.

    Hello Mariette,

    The light treatment will "work" for 3 days. This is when the information
    you offered to the body is integrated and the body acts on it. However when
    suppression is lifted by the treatment, this is (hopefully) something that
    doesn't come back. So there's always a chance that an old infection might
    flare up and gives symptoms past the 3 days of action. 
   
    Because it is not the treatment itself that causes these reactions (not
    directly), but the body that is now able to fight infections again, you
    can't say anything about how long they are going to last. Just like you
    can't predict how long a cold is going to last when you catch it.
     
    Suppression that's lifted and an immune function that starts functioning
    again, of course, can have many expressions and it is good to be aware of
    what you're treating and to support in a way that eases the healing
    afterward. 

    Sometimes in a chronic condition, when the suppression is gone,
    inflammation might flare up as a healing reaction of the body. But usually
    the body deals with this in a couple of days. Only in case of Chronic
    Appendicitis Johan takes the precaution of putting Appendicitis in at the
    same time. Tonsillitis he just allows to flare up if it happens... 
    It is not the case that a chronic condition will always create acute
    reactions when it is treated though.

    Hi Johan & Karolina,
    I have noticed there are times when appendicitis shows up on the TESTING
    but not tonsillitis. However, I also notice that many times after I have
    found the remedy to use to clear the appendicitis, that the tonsillitis
    point then drops and I have to treat the tonsillitis. What is the
    connection between finding a remedy for something and then the body
    revealing a new thing? Is this an example of a layer do dis-ease in the
    body and the body needs to clear one thing at a time? Or, how would you
    speak about this.
    Thanks,
    Rich

ADHD - Lots of Medications

sallydyer
February 2014 edited February 2014 in Medication Flag
Client: 
A potential new client- 9 yr old boy. The mom works in administration at the
hospital and continues to work with western medicine but the dad wants to start
looking elsewhere for help.

Symptoms:
Uncontrollable talking 
Excessive behavior issues 

Medical Diagnoses: 
ADHD and twice exceptional (intellectually gifted) => diagnosed age 4
"PANDAS" (Strep in the brain + immune system over drive) => recently diagnosed
=> mom feels like there is finally an answer to all their problems.

Medication:
Sertraline (once a day) => treats depression and OCD 
Methylphenidate (twice a day) => for ADHD 
Clonindine (twice a day) => treats high blood pressure and ADHD
Iron tablets 
Trazo-Done (one a bedtime) => to help intimate sleep 
Montelukast (one at bedtime) => to prevent Asthma attacks
Fluticasone Proppionate (nasal spray) => stuffy nose and allergies. 

Questions: 
1. I know to follow protocol and start to clean up the thus heavily drugged
system but at what point do I ask the parents to start weaning this child off
of all of these medications? 
2. The Fluticasone is a corticosteriod so does every 3 treatments count as 1?
This Is so heart breaking to think a 9 year old is on so much medication!

    You have not seen this client as yet so I can only go on a few of the
    symptoms that are described…

    * The Asthma might have a few causes. One being a Whiplash and two being
    sensitivity of the Mucous Membranes, which is most likely caused by a Staph
    /Strep infection on the Lungs.
   
    * I need to have a time line. When did the individual symptoms appear?
   
    * The talking could be a sign that the child is not being heard, that there
    is insufficient time spent on the child
   
    * ADHD and OCD as well as High Blood Pressure are all Gallbladder issues
    caused by something. 
    Spin Inversion, Infections, Vaccination, Medication could all be a cause
    but you need to measure in order to get answers. 
   
    * I have also one question: why is he on Iron supplements?

    Answers:
    1 & 2 I have no idea how this medication works so I do not know if it also
    blocks treatment results and if they need to be stopped (they might even
    cause the symptoms…). 
    When medication is an issue I would suggest to look them up on the
    internet, see how they work and what side effects they have.
    Usually I just treat and see how things improve before I discuss tapering
    down or stopping medication.
   
    I suggest you do not ask the parents to reduce anything until the
    measurements are better.

    Considering PANDAS follows an infection with Streptococcus Haemolyticus,
    this nosode of course should be kept in mind… 

    Scarlatinum, being a consequence of of Strep infection is another remedy
    that might be useful.

    And of course (Chronic) Tonsillitis

    But apart from this Cause there are probably other things that created his
    susceptibility for the infection to become PANDAS…

    Thank you for all your advice! have looked up the medication on the
    internet and I will keep it in mind if the child starts treatments. It is
    helpful to have your clarity on how to handle medications for clients. I am
    sure the child was susceptible to Pandas because of the Strep infection and
    years of shots and medications and concussions.

Increased Eye Pressure (Glaucoma) - Can Biontology Help?

TorilJelterTorilJelter
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Symptoms Flag
Client: Artist with family history of increased eye pressure (became curious
when his wife improved significantly with treatment)

His vision improved significantly during the first session. He sleeps better
and handles stress better. Life flows better.

So he sees his eye doctor this week. The eye pressure has increased to
borderline high (20) since his last visit with the eye doctor 6-12 months ago
but his vision is still better after the biophoton treatments and continues to
be good. He also has a cold now.

My thoughts are that the eye pressure was higher than 20 when we started
sessions (about 5 so far) or his vision getting better has nothing to do with
glaucoma. I think he is nervous now because he wonders if biophoton therapy can
make eye pressure worse.

Feedback I may share with him from those that have treated glaucoma would be
appreciated.

    I have no recent feedback from those people. I have not treated anyone with
    glaucoma in the US. It has been a long time since I had a client with
    glaucoma.

    The rise in pressure might be caused by the removal of suppression that the
    Chiren always does.
    You need to treat the Circulation and the cause which are Gallbladder or
    Calcification issues

    Glaucoma is a pressure problem (Gallbladder) and I have seen both blood
    pressure and eye pressure rise after treatment because of the suppression
    that is lifted. 

    But then, when you continue to treat (Gallbladder, Calcification,
    Circulation), things will improve again. 

    Have you seen him more than once?

    Johan,
    So you think suppression can keep the eye pressure down? I think maybe his
    eye pressure was higher when we started sessions and now it came down to 20
    (borderline high) after 7 sessions. (6-12 months ago it was 13) or maybe
    having a cold could increase it? 

    But I'll never know since we didn't have a measurement shortly before
    starting sessions. Have you ever had someone with glaucoma that got worse?
    His vision improved remarkably during the first session and stayed better.
    (He was in Spin Inversion) 

    Yes you are right we worked on Circulation, Calcification and Gallbladder.
    The Gallbladder showed 5 drops at the last visit last week (7th) but this
    time I had been using Gallbladder remedies for other things earlier.

    QUESTION: Have you ever had anyone with glaucoma get worse?

What Everyone Needs To Know - The Second Part Of The Q&A

Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
October 2014 edited November 2014 in H.A.A. Messages Flag
We are at the end of our questions but I want to discuss another issue that has
bothered me a lot for quite a long time now. From a professional stand we all
believed it was better to not stoop to the level of people who spread malicious
gossip about us, but in view of current events there is no other way to
confront things directly especially since the gossip seems to have come from,
and has been supported by people who used to work for me.

What has come to my attention is that false rumours have been spread about
IABS, Karolina and I. We thought that these stories would easily be revealed
for what they are, which is that they are all just too RIDICULOUS to be true.
However, discernment did not happen and these stories have caused a very
hostile climate that even prevented anyone from verifying any of these
assumptions. What has been happening is beyond my comprehension, because
Biontology is all about finding the truth by never assuming anything, doubting
information and checking its truth and relevance before accepting it. This has
caused a disease inside the Biontology community that is now so widespread that
I can only hope that there are enough unaffected practitioners with common
sense left to make it healthy again.

I cannot go into every single story, but will at another time if need be.
The most important and influential lies that have been told are that Biontology
has changed, and that there is secret knowledge that I used to teach and do not
anymore, and that Karolina caused flower essences and notes to been abandoned
by me. In fact there are many things that have been blamed on Karolina that are
not true at all.

The truth is that Karolina has been with me or in communication with me almost
every single day for the last 4 years, and has been my voice when expressing
anything about Biontology. We have been a team from day one. Something I have
never experienced before. Others have tried to change Biontology to fit their
ego-trips, but Karolina never did. She helped me to restore the integrity of
Biontology teachings before it was too late. To hear people are turning things
around and claiming that Karolina changed my ways is very painful.

What you all need to know is that I have always felt very alone in my
understanding about Biontology until I met Karolina. She asked me the right
questions, has a natural capacity for synthesis thinking and could connect the
dots as to translate them in a way that maybe more people will start to
understand Biontology.

Karolina also got me involved in the basic trainings again. In the past I hired
other teachers to do this for me, but it all went wrong because I lost touch
with the students and what they were actually doing. This created the
opportunity for my former teachers to misrepresent me and to almost take over.
By using my name, my trust in them and my reputation, they have built their
credibility, but what they are in fact teaching has little to do with
Biontology as I developed it. The problem was that I used to hear that the
courses were excellent, and Karolina and I were under the impression that Nora
was in fact a good teacher. I did not realise, however, that the content of the
courses was not accurate or outside of protocol.

Unfortunately I had the illusion that Sophie, who I personally taught,
understood Biontology and I trusted her to teach it. I did not check this
enough. Whenever I was present in her classes she appeared to speak about the
basic techniques and knowledge that new students need to learn, but just before
I came to the US in 2012 I started to see that she taught something else when I
was not present. I asked her many times to stick to the basics and leave all of
her ideas out of it, but she did not want to do it. She made the decision to
stop teaching after I approached her with evidence that she was not following
the basic principles of Biontology.

What I would like to emphasise, is that Nora was not taught by me personally! I
have heard that she claims this but it is not true. She was taught by Sophie.
Before I hired Nora to teach I clearly instructed her in WHAT she should teach,
but she taught her own version and continues to do so. Nora claims to have
secret knowledge that she received through me. I can assure you that Nora did
not get any special insights in the very short time she spent with me.

In my very brief relationship with Nora there was no room for Biontology. I
never saw her in her practice, she hardly ever saw me practice, she hardly ever
asked me questions, she only saw me teach a couple of times as to prepare her
to teach basic classes. There is no foundation for her claim to have advanced
knowledge at all, and I can tell you our new teachers are already more
knowledgeable on the subject of Biontology than she is.

The fact that Nora lacks basic understanding about client safety, has become
painfully clear as she has damaged clients and even has a threat of lawsuit
hanging over her head in Norway. Not only have people become very ill due to
over treatment, Nora has also blamed them for not getting well so she does not
have to take the responsibility for her lack of success.

Karolina and I have been together almost every day since we met and all
therapeutic questions are always answered in cooperation with me. She has
learned Biontology first hand like no one else. The person who has spread the
idea that Karolina has changed my way of assessment and treatment, has not
understood me in the first place.

I do understand that the atmosphere of suspicion may block openness to receive
the truth behind all of this, but at least I have tried. We have been so busy
constructing the business that we couldn’t step outside of the business to
reach practitioners and be visible. Unfortunately this has given people plenty
of time to manipulate opinions.

I want to end this Q&A with a big warning not to follow any of the suggestions
Nora teaches. I want to make clear that she has lost all my respect and belief
in her and that I do not support anything she does. Nora thinks she will become
the main teacher of Biontology, but she is not allowed to even call herself a
Biontologist and she never will be allowed in the future either. Everyone who
is affiliated with her cannot be a Biontologist since she goes against protocol
and hurts people. Any further training you engage in needs to be approved by
Health Angel Academy otherwise you won't be considered for certifications.

This is not a game this is reality. Nora has seriously injured a fellow
practitioner with her actions and severely traumatized her emotionally.
Biontology is not a cult that needs a cult-leader like Nora tries to be. It
needs common sense and self-reflection. It needs a healthy support network
where people share in a positive way and can help each other grow and point
each other’s mistakes in order to improve.

You all do not need Nora's help or teachings. Her help has damaged people
emotionally, physically and financially. As many of you know, she was
hospitalised for Kidney failure after over treating herself, which clearly
exemplifies her lack of understanding of Biontology. I cannot make you do
anything you do not want, because the Chiren is yours, but to protect future
clients from the travesty of Biontology she spreads, my conscience requires me
to urge you to not follow Nora’s classes, don’t seek out her treatments, and in
any case do not believe she is psychic or is in some way more evolved than you.
(she uses this to project her own problems onto others in an abusive way)

You are the future of Biontology!

    I'm glad to hear that not everyone got involved in these rumours.
   
    The negative atmosphere that we are dealing with is caused by manipulative
    abuse of the social network of practitioners. People who are most affected
    are the ones who have sought out support and community, which in essence of
    course is a good thing. The main "tool" that is being used is distorting my
    words about professionalism, respect for clients and consciousness about
    risks, and presenting them as a "lack of freedom."

    Nora wrote recently in an email to solicit students for her class:
    "I hold nothing against you if you do not sign up, no warnings, no
    punishment, Im living in a free world."

    I read between the lines: 
    "They (I or people who work for me) are oppressive and allow you no
    freedom. They (we) punish you if you think for yourself. If you follow IABS
    advises and adhere to protocols you are allowing yourself to be suppressed
    and are not free."
   
    Her words -also the ones in between lines- are just words, but to find the
    truth you have to look at actions and their consequences. Her actions show
    a lack of concern for the client's physical and emotional wellbeing. Some
    cases we know of are truly heartbreaking. If personal freedom goes without
    respect and responsibility it is worth nothing.
   
    I do hope that the people who were brave enough to come to me with their
    stories will also have the courage to, at one point, share them publicly.
    Please be open when someone shows their vulnerability by sharing their
    traumatic story.

    I, too, was completely unaware of any of this and it is devastating to hear
    that the practice of Biontology has been so abused and disrespected. As
    little as I know and as inexperienced as I personally am, during classes
    and Q & A's I have often been confounded by repeated questions about how to
    treat this disease or that, and would practically scream at the computer
    "Follow protocol! The answer is always to follow protocol! You're not
    treating diseases, you are reading and treating the client. Period!" Am I
    naive in this thinking? My husband and I have received great improvements
    from an excellent practitioner, Ember Rose, who does just that-- she
    FOLLOWS PROTOCOL. A session takes an hour and a half because she is
    thorough and complete and follows the procedure exactly as Johan did when
    he gave me my first treatment in class. ; Ember does so each and every time
    as if we were walking in as new people. No assumptions are made. The
    procedure is followed to the letter. She does not claim any quick fixes or
    attempt to adapt or pare down the process for her convenience. I wonder if
    people aren't trying to find shortcuts to save time and energy, because
    from what I was taught, there are no shortcuts. And I wonder if this isn't
    a big cause of mistreatment--people thinking they can find a "better,
    easier way" than the man who spent his lifetime developing and perfecting
    this.We have all been privileged to have had the course of our lives lead
    us to Biontology, and it is shameful that the light of it has been tainted
    in this way by what I can only hope is a small minority. I recall Johan
    saying several times that he wants to hear from us--hear if something new
    may have revealed itself through our experiences. He is open to new
    knowledge, but that knowledge needs to come about through the use of the
    methods as he taught them, not from reckless experimentation. 

    To Johan and Karolina: I am so sorry to hear of this, and of your feeling
    forced to leave the US, though I understand completely considering the
    position in which you've been placed. I'd like to express my appreciation,
    support and hopes for a brighter future for Biontology and for you both
    personally. Sincerely, Connie Gombert. (GomBert)

    Thank you for your support Connie. I think that you are very right in your

    this idea of speeding things up by finding shortcuts, is that it will do
    exactly the opposite. Yes one will be able to see 10 people a day instead
    of 5, but they will have to be treated many times more and may have
    undesirable reactions. Making a thorough assessment is key to the
    effectiveness and safety of Biontology. 

    About this whole mess that was created outside of our sphere of influence:
    Damage done by smear campaigns is almost impossible to repair, because most
    people find it difficult to accept that they have fallen for utter lies and
    because sometimes they even have supported the liar whom they mistakenly
    believed was the victim..

    LINK

    I can only say I have fallen for this victim game too in the past, and have
    "protected" Nora against two men who Johan and I were starting to develop a
    good friendship with. This friendship is now lost, and I am very ashamed to
    have to admit I have fallen for these malicious lies. Nora's lies follow
    the same pattern always, she talks about others being users, abusers,
    liars, opportunists, greedy, jealous etc. ALL projections of course when
    you look at the facts. We were blissfully unaware of anything going on
    until Nora put Johan on the spot DEMANDING she wanted her salary to be
    doubled. At that time, because she taught almost all classes, she made
    10.000 dollar on average a month.

    What I hope to achieve by writing this down is that those of you who have
    supported Nora don't feel as stupid by having been fooled by her as I feel.
    My inner motivation is to be truthful and sincere, but by believing Nora's
    lies about these men I was manipulated in becoming untruthful myself in a
    way. It feels like having been violated in my core values… I blamed one of
    these men of being narcissistic and of lying about Nora. He was in fact
    pinpointing exactly the issues we are now confronted with. He told us she
    was unprofessional, seductive and manipulative. At the time I was set up by
    Nora to believe he was smearing her...

    I just want you to know that all of you who believed Nora, have just been
    played for your good qualities, which are empathy and a desire to help
    someone in need. Nora however is not someone in need. She was never fired,
    but decided that 10.000 dollar a month on average (500 euros per [online]
    teaching day) was not enough for her and that she was "worth far more" than
    that. She wanted to have this salary doubled and there was no negotiation
    possible. Apart from that she has received a lot of financial support from
    Johan over the years. 

    Johan nor I have ever received anything else but "niceness" from Nora
    (during the brief encounters we had, there really was not that much
    contact) until she all of a sudden wanted to double her salary. The
    unconditional love she proclaimed to have for Johan disappeared the moment
    she did not get what she demanded materially, proving that her whole
    "friendship" with us was solely based on opportunism. We now know that even
    when she was acting as a friend, she already was preparing the stage for
    her dramatic exit by spreading many of the lies she is still telling
    people. 

    At first I believed it was better to let it all go, but as we were
    confronted with the severe emotional and physical abuse of a fellow
    practitioner there was no other way than to share the truth. This person
    who was victimised by Nora is very weak right now and emotionally
    vulnerable and we hoped to make it easier for her to open up about what
    happened in Norway, as she is very afraid of being judged. Sadly she feels
    there is still little openness to the truth.

    Hi Johann and Karolina
    I usually do not involve myself with dramas and gossip much
    However reading your email make me share my insight now......
    When I first met you Johann I knew what a genuine human being you were
    I believe in your heart and in your mission to bring healing and "Light" in
    this world
    The Chiren is a great instrument that you have given as a means to achive
    that light work
    I have had amazing amazing results with my client and my own family members
    This is truly and wonderful gift to the world
    I love the protocol and your straight forward instructions
    You always said use your intuition as well
    I love that
    But
    Johann im so sorry that you and your work here is being compromised this
    way.....by petty human egos.....
    So sad!!!
    And....
    I'm not surprised !
    Where ever there is light....the darkness through human ego want to attack
    it and dim it.....
    It's alway been this way in this luciferic world
    I pray that you be strong and not be maligned by their egos

    In time this too shall pass
    I support you one thousand present and so do all the angels above
    Forgive them(and stand up for your self as well) for they know not
    The Chiren is the testimony of your Truth!
    God bless
    Namaste'

    I am new here. I have read this discussion, and though it makes me sad, I
    can't say I'm surprised. Such self-centered and outlandish behavior seems
    to be virtually inevitable, a pattern that has occurred in many modalities,
    and in academia as well.

    It would seem that whenever there is a sincere effort to do something good
    for humanity, to bring forth more Light, whether literally or figuratively,
    some individual's self-interest goes crazy. This has happened frequently in
    human history, and for that matter even God has experienced a much-loved
    close associate who refused to follow protocol and caused much trouble,
    when you consider the little problem He has had with Lucifer.

    I am a Guild Certified Feldenkrais Practitioner. The Feldenkrais Guild of
    North America was almost destroyed by the legal costs of warring
    practitioners after the death of Moshe Feldenkrais. My friends who practice
    Rolfing have told me similar tales about battles after Ida Rolf's death,
    and Rolfing sites speak of "the inevitable fractures and resultant legal
    battles which followed Dr. Rolf's death". And there are so many similar
    stories!

    Biontology is very lucky in one key way. Johan is right here. Fortunately,
    all this insanity has happened during his life. He can make his wishes
    known about anything and everything, explicitly, and he can answer our
    questions directly. If we polish our skills, follow protocol, and just do
    our work, Biontology will thrive. We can't change human nature, (unless
    Johan can find a remedy for stupidity or ignorance!), so it would seem to
    me, as a beginning practitioner, that the only reasonable response to this
    situation is simply to do our work, as well as we can.

Symptoms:
Little bumps on my chest = I have them for probably 10 years. 
They aren't pimples or blackheads but just little bumps all over between my
chest.  
The bumps never go away and they aren't able to be popped.

Question:
Does anyone know anything about this? Thank you!

    What I need to know:
    Which Intestine (Large or Small?, Left or Right?)
    Which points on Stomach and Lymph drop?
    On what remedies do the points react?
    What do you experience after treatment? Any improvement?
    How often do you treat yourself?

    History:
    Mononucleosis (Pfeiffer) =>  2 1/2 years ago => Tonsils have been a problem
    ever since 

    Doctor's advise:
    Remove tonsils, but I didn't

    Typically measurement picture:
    Small Intestine (L)
    Lymphatic System - 3rd and 4th point 
    Stomach - 4th and 5th point
   
    Remedies that show up:
    Food poisoning nosodes
    Chronic Tonsillitis
    Strep/Staph
   
    Reactions after treatment:
    I have recently been treating myself weekly due to the fact that I have had
    a cold for 3 weeks.
    I rarely ever see improvement in myself.

    Questions/Comments:
    1. From what direction do you calculate the number of points? If you say
    Stomach 4 & 5, do you mean the most distal or most proximal points? Same
    question for the Lymphatic points?
   
    2. What Food Poisonings and where do they match? Food poisonings could
    match on all points

    3. If Food Poisonings regularly are measured, are they the same Food
    Poisonings? 

    4. Did you ever clean your fridge completely and throw everything away? It
    could be in the fridge and everything in the fridge would be affected every
    time you put anything in... That would be one possible cause for not
    getting better.
   
    5. Strep and Staph are most likely on your Lymphatic points or on your
    Stomach points IF it is a Jaw issue.
    I am wondering about your Jaw, this may be another cause. 

    6. If you rarely see an improvement in yourself, I suggest that you check
    all possible actions that you take.
    Eating for example: what did you eat and what kind of food poisoning do you
    measure afterwards?

    Point 6 would be right by the nail, so starting from the bottom knuckle
    being 1. I usually have all food poisonings match on the small intestine
    and lymphatic systems with all points out of balance.  I've never cleaned
    out my fridge of everything but I will definitely give it a try! I haven't
    had any significant jaw issues before but I have had my wisdom teeth
    removed in 2012 so maybe there could have been an acute infection??  I
    don't recall eating anything in particular and then measuring food
    poisoning. I haven't tested myself right after eating.

Colitis Ulcerosa for which she received a lot of medication. Without
Antibiotics (didn't want to take this anymore).
Stopped taking the drugs 5 weeks before first treatment.

Treatment:
I've treated her last year for 6 Sessions.
All Vaccinations, many Heavy Metals, 3x Whiplash (last time with gel-pads) were
treated.
I can't recall whether we did all the child's diseases. We didn't work with
protocoll at that time.
All Problems were gone after the 6th Session.
The last Session only one Hormonal point dropped that was OK in earlier
treatments.

Recent situation:
Suffers from the same problems again: Diarrhea with Blood in the Stool.

1st Session:
Measurement:
No Spin Inversion or Whiplash

Hormonal System (L-1point)
Circulation (L-1point)
Veins (L-1point)
Large Intestines (L-2points + R-1point)
Small Intestines (R-2points)
Lungs (R-1point)

Bladder (L-1point)
Gallbladder (R-3points)

>12 Years Program:
Chronic Appendicitis, Appendicites, Chronic Tonsillitis, Tonsilitis,
Cholecystitis, Platinum 

Footplates:
Atropinum, Plumbum Metallicum, Aletris

2nd Session:
Measurement:
Small Intestines (L-1point + R-1point)
Organ Degeneration (L-1point
Circulation (L-1point + R-1point)
Lungs (L-1point)
Veins (R-2points)

No drops on Feet

>12 Year Program:

Results:
After the first session her symptoms improved, but now she doesn't feel almost
no progression and suffers again from the diarrhea.

Question:
Do you have any advice?

    Your case provides exactly the information of what went wrong.... do you
    see the difference between the session that did work and the one that
    didn't? 

    Which remedies are always needed in Colitis Ulcerosa?

    Maybe other practitioners can help you with this one...

    chronic appendicitis!! (necrotic), appendicitis and also chronic
    tonsillitis if you measure it- because it is the same tissue .Good  support
    remedy is anginheel, tonsilla comp.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel

    Yes!
    And none of these remedies were used in the second Session. Usually they
    need to be used more than once to allow the body to heal this condition
    properly. 

    It is also important to focus the used support on the Intestines and
    Tonsils. Anginheel and Tonsilla Compositum are very good supports to help
    the Appendix and Tonsils heal. Mucosa could be another one. And when things
    start to improve the Intestinal Flora Bacteria.

    Another remedy that is very good in Colitis Ulcerosa is Carcinoma Coli.

    I measured a lady yesterday with some magnet jewellery, I guess that were
    weak ones since drops was showing.

    She had deep and long scar across her tummy, which I treated with
    blu-orange dots no remedy.
    After that I used glass rods with Procranium and treated horizontally all
    the front .
    Neck same without remedy.

    Thereafter I measured, and drops were showing, though seem a few masking.
    (I knew this so I kept the remedies in the slots and measured once).

    Measured again before the Footplates, ( perfect balance) where I had two
    spots kept opening for nosodes, and the rest for support.

    Yes and then I balanced the rest of the Hormonal System with the Nosodes.
    I was totally focused on protocol, but kept an eye to her Stomach.

    I have no experience with the magnets other then this, in combi with
    Chiren. Thank you.

    You must remember first to treat the Scars after a Full Measuring, else you
    wont be able to see the changes. 

    Why do you use Brass instead of Glass Rods first? 
    Did you remember to take 7 cm at a time, if the Scar was long? Procranium
    is used for Internal Scars.

    Hello Peter, thanks for your questions.
    I cuztomize scar treatments sometimes where my gut feeling tells me this is
    to be done as in this case.
    I used in this case the blue/orange dots to open the field across her tummy
    with Procarinum.

    The distance should not exeed 7 cm, as far as I remember from my training,
    but I use 4 cm between.

    Yes Procarinum is used for internal scars which this lady had gotten during
    several operations back then in South Africa.

    If you read I use the Brass instead of Glass, read again, please :) I used
    the Glass Rods vertically.
    That means I treated horizontall and vertically....no Procarinum in the
    neck area.

    Peter is right in that the Scar Treatment should never be done before
     measurement. Because you really need to know what was corrected by it.

    You mention somewhere:

    "...then I balanced the rest of the Hormonal System with the Nosodes" after
    the Footplates...

    But before that you said that everything was balanced... after the hand
    treatment. Did new drops show up (only after the Footplates!!) on the
    Hormonal System that you had to correct? If this is what happened there
    must have been a lot of suppression (endorphins).

    You also write:

    "..... used the blue/orange dots to open the field across her tummy with
    Procarinum"

    This doesn't make sense. Both Glass and Brass restore the energetic
    blockage of a Scar, but Brass seems to have a more physically healing
    effect (cosmetic) on the Scar and Glass allows all frequencies through
    (which in Scar treatment is not most important). This is the only
    difference. Nothing to do with opening up fields... both will do this and
    since Glass allows a wider range of frequencies, it would even make more
    sense the other way around.

    But this is only talk about understanding what you do. Since of course, you
    will have good results.... you did a very thorough Scar Treatment ;-).

    Karolina, I try to reconstruct my writing again :)

    When I measure I am more focused on the sound than the red or green or the
    diagram on Chiren. A point for me is not always " balanced" by green light,
    it is the quality of the sound that I find more valid.

    After the first treatment "ok " balanced more or less everything, my main
    focus was the Triple Warmer. However I had my radar out....and preparing
    for Foot Treatment .(use support remedies mostly since no filter ).
    Now I caught the Bladder and Kidneys and Stomach and even Liver and
    Pancreas and Gallbladder measure improvement.

    Herpes Simplex and Zoster adressed it and made the rest fall into place.
    Plus 6 Support Remedies .
    Yes, also the Hormonal System got a better measurement quality after this.

    PS.

    Measured more "solid green " readings after the Fooplates is what I tried
    say in my privious presentation.:) I am so useless in writing, I get very
    focused and drown into the measurement there and then, and afterwards no
    easy to recall the energy in the situation....And really, I am not so keen
    either. I step out of that "room".....

    The last two spots for for the nosodes, Herpes Zoster and Herpes Zoster
    supported the Hormonal System with a more solid result in the end. ( I am
    so qurious so I measured again).

    Hope this answer your question. If not just chop my head off :)

    Karolina support your feedback to me about to :

    " You must remember first to treat the Scars after a Full Measuring, else
    you wont be able to see the changes...... "

    Do you mean it is the client that need to see this and or me? Or do you
    mean it is " masking" of some kind, that I must know before treating
    .....which will only show
    then?

    I might be totally wrong in my thinking, but it has worked when I most
    often treat the Scar before Measurement.

    May be my results gets even better if I do as u say. I will try :)

    1.That you could have more space between the Glass Rods during the Whiplash

    2.That we treat with Variolinum instead of Herpes Nosodes? Would be nice to

    April 2013 edited April 2013 Flag
    Full measuring is necessary for you to see what systems have been blocked
    as far as the measurements are concerned. 
    Then you need to treat the Scars and Measure the Points again. You can
    limit your remeasuring to the meridians that did not drop, or Measure only
    the Meridians that were Cut (where the Scar runs). 
   
    You need to know the exact Locations of the Meridians. The restoration of
    the Flow of one Meridian, might also influence the Flow of the other
    Meridians so treatment of a Scar might influence all your readings.

    We have to remember that the body always heals itself. This healing process
    will only start if the Hormonal System is corrected, this must always be
    our first objective, every session, whatever the Readings or Symptoms.

    Stay Objective and Structured. If your "radar" is focused for example on
    the Stomach, you have already lost your Objectivity.

    Most people write down the points that are dropping after their Initial
    Measurement and go on these.
    But if you have corrected the Hormonal System or any other point, other
    points might have come right and do not need further assistance. 

    So, before you start measuring remedies on a point, first check if the
    point is still dropping. This is the idea: to get Maximum Effect with a
    Minimum Number of Remedies.

    That is why one needs to measure first all points and try to figure out if
    there are any conditions that affect more than one organ. It also makes a
    difference if the points drop on the Left Hand or the Right Hand.
    Both hands represent different parts of the organs and are indicating
    different things.

    One can only do this by Continuously Monitoring the Measurements and the
    Reactions of the Body.

    Example: 
    Any Food Poisoning can trigger Appendicitis to come back.
    Observation: "If I do this, then this happens with other systems, these and
    these remedies affect these and these organs or points." 
   
    If you do this real investigative work all the time you start to see
    Patterns. But do not get distracted by "Side Paths". You need to stay on
    your Main Path. You might investigate a Side Path, but you need to come
    back to the Main Path. Otherwise it all gets very Chaotic and you loose the
    Overview. But the main thing is to stay Objective.

    Johan:
    I have read this several times now, and I need to be more systematic in my
    activities. It is difficult, because I get new ideas as go along. 
    Even when the Hormonal System is straightened out, which I always do, I am
    still not quite happy.....

    My thinking is: "It can be done better". And I look to reduce the Nosodes/
    Remedies to find the ones that correct more Meridians.That is the fun part
    for me.
    Often this is very easy to do. Less is more.... 

    But, here is where I need to stop, but unfortunately I do not resist the
    temptation to add in extra Support Remedies..... because then it seems
    there are "empty spots". So I fill in with a bit Support....(very stupid).

    Your reply is  valuable for me, and this last part especially is about what
    is vital.

    '' You need to stay on your main path. You might investigate a side path,
    but you need to come back to the main path. Otherwise it all gets very
    chaotic and you loose the overview. But the main thing is to stay
    objective."

    Liselotte: 
    1 Physical Scars have a Maximum of 7 CM between the Rods, Energetic Scars
    (e.g. Whiplash) are allowed more distance between the Rods. 
    2. Yes, Variolinum has a bigger effect than the Herpes Nosodes on the
    condition Herpes...

    Beate: 
    I think Johan gave you all the answers ;-) 
    It is not about the results of the Scar Treatment, they will be fine no
    matter when in your session you are going to address them. But it is all
    about losing valuable Information... that is needed to see Patterns and
    develop Understanding.

    You can also get sidetracked by "drops" or "no drops", since there's so
    much more to an effective Biontology treatment than that. Some remedies
    will solve drops without giving the results you need..... objective
    observation will allow you to see connections and to understand what is
    really effective and what's not.

    Don't forget that Support is also very valuable. I don't know how much you
    think is too much... but Systems that are out of balance, need both Nosodes
    and Support. 

    And also remember that when you take a Remedy out after a successful
    Measurement, to replace it with another one, the drops that were corrected
    might stay corrected for a couple of minutes. So you might get a false
    positive read for those points (since you took the corrective Remedy out)
    and after treatment they will drop again... 
    Or if they are masked by a small correction made just by the Light
    Treatment or by other Remedies that you used in the Hand Treatment that are
    not most effective, a System might not get a strong enough Informational
    impulse to heal. 
    So usually it is best, that when you measure something is effective, you
    leave it in. The right order of testing Remedies as suggested in the
    Protocol will allow you to test the most potent Remedies for an Organ
    System first.

    Hi karolina,

    I have a question about your advice; when you measure that some remedie
    (nosode or composita) is effective, you leave it into the slots.
    Sometimes when I am at step 3 (circulation) from the protocol all my slots
    are full.....
    Usualy I go to the next steps and removed composita/support for example
    selenium, berberis, atropine, barijodeel and aurumheel.
    So I have slots to measure what is needed there. After I have looked and
    what is needed for all points I make choices witch remedies I choose for
    the first >12 year program. I write down witch remedies are left and after
    the first program I measure if there is still a need for using them.

    QUESTION:
    Is this wrong? Is it better to do the first program with the first 8
    remedies? So I have to accept that the other meridians are 'left overs' for
    the next dyslexia program are worse for next appointment.......

    Thanks for your attention :-)

    No perfectly fine.... as long as you use those Support Remedies on the
    Footplates.

    Karolina,

    This question was well worded and your answer helps me enormously with the
    circulation issue that I already entered on the forum under 'Circulation".
    This means that you can address the meridian in the correct order, but
    substitute much needed nosodes on the first 12> treatment. Then, after
    measuring, if needed, put them back in on the footplates. I like it!

Dear Johan and Karolina
I have a lady who would like me to treat her, but she had surgery 4/24/10 and
had a Cow's Aortic Valve put into her and mesh (doesn't know which kind)
wrapped around her Aortic Artery.

In my notes, I have Johan saying it's OK if the transplant was a long time ago
(no exact time stated) ...the discussion started with Breast Implants but then
went on to include other transplants.....but in more recent discussions, I
heard we are never to treat someone with these things.

Would you please clarify?

ALSO......what about new lenses surgically attached to the eyes?

    I would not treat this lady.
    In your notes you have a remark that does not refer to these kind of cases.

    If it has been a long time ago, then you could treat if it concerns a:
    Blood Transfusion, 
    Bone Marrow Transplant 
    Bone Replacement by a Cadaver Bone. 

    But not with Veins like this case, this is foreign tissue in a critical
    location and that's always a big NO.

    Thank you for clarification on my client.

    Questions: 
    1. Can you be more specific.....what do you mean by "if it has been a long
    time ago"? 6 months? a year?
   
    2. What about surgical lenses? Yes or no if they've had retinal lenses? I
    have a few people who had cataract surgery who would like treatment....

    3. This cam up in discussions with Rich....  
    Prosthesis (e.g. denture, bone), he heard, is a contraindication... why?
     Does that apply to Dental Implants and Crowns?  I thought the body didn't
    reject Metal...so if it's Porcelain is that a problem? only if it's
    connected to the Jaw?

    4. What about prescription Anti-Acids?  Is that a Contra-Indication or will
    it just take more sessions to see results?

    I'm re-doing my in-take form and would like to have all of this clear.Thank
    you for your time and attention.

    1. With a long time I meant 6-12 months

    2. Surgical lenses are not a contra-indication

    3. Prothesis are no contra-indication for treatments, neither are oral
    implants
   
    4. With Proton Pump Inhibitors we do not see any results. Medication that
    doesn't block acid production but only neutralizes the acid in the Stomach
    is different and does allow healing.

Big Bags under Eyes

What organs are involved in this Symptom (bags under the eyes)

Kidney/Liver problems?

    To come to an answer to your question, you'll have to ask yourself what
    those bags under the eyes are...

    Question:
    What do you think they are and how do you see that the organs you mention
    might be involved?
  •

    I have tried to find correlations on baggy eyes by reading into Chinese
    Medicine Teachings, and I wondered if in Biontology there are insights
    about the Cause.

    I don't have bags under my eyes, but Spanish people, alcoholics and people
    who use a lot of (medical) drugs often get them when they are still quite
    young. 

    Anyway I have been wondering about this all year. Because in Spain the high
    voltage, electricity cables are not far from the ground and it is said that
    Spanish people often die of too many Toxins causing the Liver to explode.
    Doctors say this is usually caused by Alcohol consumption, but I feel there
    might be other causes too.

    Another issue is that many Old Couples die at almost the same time of
    Cancer. 
    My suspicion is that all these things have a Connection to the Radiation. 

    I love living her. But if this can be the case....

    (Somethimes we wake up with bags under The eyes. Appendix treatment
    together with solidago and plantago takes The bags away.)

    Stress (and Radiation causes Stress to the body!!!), Alcohol and Drugs are
    all Toxins that affect the Liver/Gallbladder... The "explosion" part sounds
    really dramatic to me.. how does that work?

    Usually the Liver will start to create Scar/Fibrous Tissue, which is called
    Liver Cirrhosis when there are too many Toxins coming in. It might
    "explode" in size.. But I think what is meant is acute Liver Failure, which
    can happen after binge drinking or an overdose of Toxins.

    My question was intended to help you with the Biontology, "helicopter
    view", way of thinking. Bags under the eyes ==> Bags of Fluid ==> Bad
    Circulation/Stagnation of Lymph Flow ==> Cause can be in the Adrenals (Lack
    of Circulatory Energy), Liver/Gallbladder (Cramping of Bloodvessels, too
    many Toxins in the Blood) or maybe even Calcification in the Circulatory
    System... 
    Or in weakened ability of the Kidneys to excrete...

    When Radiation is the main Cause, this will be reflected in your
    Measurement as: 
    A Lack of Aura (measurement of Ozaliet), 
    Weakened Adrenals (Selenium/Berberis), and 
    Liver/Gallbladder Stress...

    Appendicitis for Radiation Problems (or baggy eyes) is something that
    hasn't been found to be a correlation... 

    At the same time that your exposure to Radiation increased by the move,
    there was most likely also a change in diet. Spain has a completely
    different lifestyle and diet than the one that is known in Norway... Maybe
    this caused a change in your gut that caused Appendicitis....( just
    guessing...)
   
    Have you also tried the Solidago and Plantago by themselves without
    Appendicitis? It is likely that stimulating the Kidneys to excrete will by
    itself help to get rid of the bags...
  • 
    CecilieCecilie
    May 2013 edited May 2013 Flag
    Yes, You are right... 
    Solidago and Plantago do help, but it the next morning the effect is gone. 
    Causticum does help too, but I only use that when I measure it on the
    Triple Warmer.
    Solidago and Plantago are Remedies I use after each Treatment as Support.

    I have been thinking about the diet change...
    The Spanish people here have an unhealthy diet. The people I see at the
    Norwegian school of my children, look much healthier than the Spanish
    people.
    We didn't change they way we eat, but of course the Bacteria and Toxins in
    the food and water are different than back in Norway.

    I thought that the Radiation was the main Cause, because when we were
    sleeping in Spiral Beds we couldn't get up in the morning, were tired all
    day, and could not hold our eyes open after 9pm. We were in Spin Inversion
    all the time. Often we had big bags under our eyes in the morning....
    At this time there were drops at all point Hand and Feet. My 3 year old was
    crying when he had to go to the toilet.
    Causticum, Plantago, and Solidago made us feel better, but only for a day.
    Treating Bacteria and other Toxins didn't help. When we changed the beds
    things improved and the Triple Warmer was mostly fine.  

    But then I found the Appendicitis problem and we all had Stomach Pain. I
    can't seem to get it right. The treatments help, but not in the same way
    they did in Norway.
    I tougth that the Radiation was causing problems for the Kidneys and
    Bladder, giving it too much to handle and because of this blocking the
    healing. 
   
    But There is something missing out like you say.... I can't figure out
    what.

    Can it be the water? There is a lot of Calcium in the Spanish water. We
    have to use Anti-Calcium for everything. Norwegian water is know to be very
    pure. And this also would explain the baby being less affected, since I'm
    still breast feeding.
    I do not know how much Calcium there is in the drinking water, and I don't
    know what it might do to the body...
   
    Questions:
    Can the Calcium cause all these drops? 
    Do we have a Remedy for this?  
  • 
    CecilieCecilie
    May 2013 edited May 2013 Flag
    I have thought about the Calcium and put some of our Drinking Water in the
    Cup. There were no drops before measuring since I have treated myself
    yesterday.
    Now with the water in the Cup, all the same drops that we usually have
    appear!!!

    Question:
    1. Do you think it is the Calcium or something else in the water? With the
    cleansing system we have the water should be free of Calcium.. but maybe it
    needs more cleaning?
    2. Can I treat the water before drinking it?
    3. Do you have other suggestions? 
    4. Reading about Calcium in the blood I find that it can cause: Cancer,
    Kidney Problems, and problems with going to the toilet (appendix..). It has
    to be the Calcium.... do we have treatment for this?
    5. I also read that it can give problems with the Nervous System. Spanish
    people are have temper. Spain is the country in Europe with most violence
    against woman.... Any comments?

    May 2013 edited May 2013 Flag
    I was working editing your post..... but wanted to comment on your last
    remark first.... since this is curious... Calcoheel has low potency Calcium
    in it, so not the opposite information of Calcium.... It won't neutralize
    any Calcium in the water.

    I think that it is mainly the light treatment itself that has corrected
    something.... but what????? It is good that you found out it is the water
    though, and I would continue to treat it since it seems to be an effective
    antidote to the harmful effect you experience....
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    May 2013 edited May 2013 Flag

    What water cleaning system do you use? I have found that in Calcoheel
    there's the opposite information of Charcoal!!!! And I know for sure
    Charcoal is causing Constipation...

    To get back to your questions above....

    1. Most water has Calcium in it and for something to create that many
    drops, I would think the Calcium is not the factor in the water that is
    harmful. If the Para-Thyroid is working correctly (and you don't measure
    otherwise) the Calcium that is ingested will be distributed to the right
    places in the body.
    2. Yes water can be treated. Even without Remedies it will change in
    quality. 
    3. You've already done what I would suggest... measure the water again with
    a Remedy in the Slots (I would have gone for Heavy Metals, Insecticides,
    other Toxins... but if it is the Charcoal... you made the right choice!)
    4. The Para-Thyroid carefully monitors the right Calcium level in the
    Blood. This is independent of the amount of Calcium ingested. It is
    dependent of the functioning of the Parathyroid.... but you haven't
    measured any problems there.
    5. High Calcium levels in the Blood affect the Nervous System, but in a
    different way than you suspect. It leads to muscle weakness, decreased
    reflexes and mentally to confusion and with extreme high Calcium Levels to
    coma.

    I've measured again, and now found:
    Chlorinum, Aluminum ==> take away one slight drop on Large Intestines (so
    less of a disturbance than Dioxine and Charcoal)
    Dioxine, Charcoal ==> Take away all, more severe, drops, many on the
    Gallbladder

    I have been reading this link....

    On the website of the water company I read that Charcoal is used to reduce
    Carbon Dioxide in the environment.
    I don't see anything about Charcoal being harmful, since it is also given
    to people with food poisoning. 
   
    I have also been reading about Dioxine. It can be found all over the world
    and is related to Hyperactivity (ADHD), Impaired/Delayed Speech and Brain
    Development. I never found it a big problem in bømlo Norway. Small
    population maybe. 
   
    Question:
    What do you think? Can you tell me what might be the problem with Charcoal?

    Does Charcoal cause constipation with the Dioxin in the body maybe? When I
    put in Dioxin first when I start measuring, the Large Intense (nail point),
    Lymphatic System and Veins/Circulation are dropping...

    How many treatments for getting it out if it is the Cause? And how big is
    the problem in Europe? And for us Biontologists? If you dont have Chiren we
    will just get it all over again... ???
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    May 2013 edited May 2013 Flag
    I mentioned Charcoal since it is the only element in Calcoheel that would
    neutralize something because of it's higher potency, and it is often found
    in water cleaning systems...... It is just creative thinking from my side
    to find an explanation, but this doesn't mean that you have been measuring
    Calcoheel for exactly this reason... 

    However, what I know from Johan about Charcoal (I used to have a Charcoal
    filter), is that it often causes Constipation. It does this all by itself,
    so it doesn't need the help of Dioxin to cause Constipation like you
    suggest....! ;-)

    It is true that Dioxin is everywhere, but it is very rare that this remedy
    is needed to help a Client restore their Health and Self Regulation. 
    Probably when the body functions correctly and the intake is not too high
    it doesn't experience too big an imbalance from Dioxin and just starts
    Detoxing it on its own as it does with most Toxins... 

    In your case it might be that you are exposed to very high levels of Dioxin
    through highly contaminated food and/or water... But since Dioxin is an
    acknowledged poison and a world wide issue, levels are usually monitored by
    law. This is why sometimes there's a "Dioxin Scandal" = meat or dairy has
    been sold with too high levels of Dioxin.....

    About Dioxin Awareness...

    Maybe you are revealing a Dioxin Scandal in Spain ;-) 
    But after your post about your flowers dying, the source of Dioxin might be
    Exhaust of a nearby Factory that falls down with the Rain.
   
    Yet another possibility. Bottled water.... PCB, Bisphenol and Dioxin are
    all related chemically so with the homeopathic similarity principle in
    mind....

    Measurements are still OK after three days... there's only one drop! We got

    Now I'll try it on a cousin and his mother, with whom I have tried
    everything. 
    They both live in Norway/Stavanger.

    The mother has CFS/ME and the boy ADHD. 
    Dioxin seems to fit perfectly with both of them... so we have to see.
    I have never tried it, because I didn't think it could do all of this.

    I also have been treating the food we eat all week with the same remedies.

    Irina:
    I still haven't had the time to thoroughly investigate water filters,
    although I want to.... I'm a prisoner of this forum LOL
    At the moment we don't use anything and I just drink glass bottled spring
    water.

    But I would go for a filter that doesn't bring anything new into the water.
    Ceramic sounds OK... 
    There must be other practitioners who are more knowledgable about this....

    Cecilie:
    I can understand your enthusiasm, but don't forget we don't work with
    recipes since there's never a fit-for-all answer. If boy and mother live in
    the same area and have the same food and exposure as your family, I can
    understand that you would want to try the same remedies.... but Dioxin is
    definitely not a remedy that is often the Cause that needs to be addressed,
    although it seems to be a very important one to use for your family.

    If Dioxin is truly the cause of the health problems in your family that is
    quite a discovery, and not a very nice one. Because this means you're
    probably living in a severely polluted area, or have at least one food
    source that is highly contaminated with Dioxin... It is very important to
    find that source and not eat it anymore, since even if you can help the
    body excrete Dioxin, the Toxin still has to go through the Liver,
    Gallbladder, Bowels and Kidneys.... and in this way burden the system.

    They are family, but we haven't lived in same town for ten years. 
    The summer house (Costa Blanca Spain) is shared by the whole family though
    and we all come there. 
    I just moved to live in that area (Costa Blanca/Alfaz del Pi).

    no drops, but overall low energy measurement
    Treatment:
    Dioxin again (1st treatment was 4 days ago)

    Results:
    Says she doesn't feel much difference yet. But she feels better in her
    head. We shall see if she continues to feel better...

    CecilieCecilie
    May 2013 edited May 2013 Flag
    What I have learned:

    * It takes 72 hours before points start dropping again
    * 5 days in between treatments is recommended to allow the body to heal.
    * The less remedies are needed the closer you are to the cause...

    What I haven't learned in class....

    * Dioxin can be measured on the Triple Warmer (new manual). I did not have
    that information before and missed this completly... 
   
    Questions: 
    1. Might the lack of knowledge about Dioxin be the cause of why I never got
    my clients well in 4-8 sesions... ? 
    2. Does Johan often use Dioxin in the first Session with his clients? 
   
    I'm still a student, helping people around me for free. I just have to see
    for the next year how many treatments my clients will have to have.

    Many Students of Biontology/Practitioners in Norway doubt that that it is
    possible to get grown ups all well in 6 treatments... Especially the
    Appendix they consider to heal very slow. Much slower than Johan Claims is
    possible. So there must be a missing link.....
   
    It took me a year to get healthy without any drops and I did treatments
    once a week. I was treated by another Practitioner before taking the course
    and don't know what I was treated with.

    # First answer:
    No... a client should not always feel worse when you choose the right
    remedy. If you treat in the right order and support well, usually people
    feel better instead of worse. The healing becomes more gentle when you know
    better what you're doing. Although there will always be clients who are
    very sensitive and react with heavy detox.... 
    I always warn clients upfront that they might have detox, but often I see
    them the next time and they are disappointed because they felt actually
    better!

    And yes... less remedies to correct all points is closer to the Cause, but
    treating with only that one remedy will not be as effective as treating
    along with the right Support Remedies. 
    Also, always be aware of the symptoms a client has.... if these don't
    correlate with what you've measured, there's a measurement problem... It
    can be endorphins, it can be related to the conductivity of the skin (too
    much moisture), it can be pressing to hard on the points etc...

    Answers to the other questions:
    1. No, it is not about the Dioxin, there's just still a lot to learn... you
    can find a wealth of information on this forum. Start with the oldest
    posts... they are very elaborate and explain a lot about the basics and
    misconceptions that were taught.

    2. What I tried to make clear, also in other reactions to your posts about
    Dioxin, is that this is not a remedy that is often needed. It is put under
    the Triple Warmer in the measurement protocol, because it is sometimes
    measured on the Pituitary Gland or even less frequently the Pineal Gland...
    It is one of the last remedies to measure there.... the order of remedies
    is an important part of the measurement protocol.

    The Measurement Protocol and everything I am integrating into my answers is
    in line with Johan's insights and treatments. So to answer your question
    more directly: No Johan doesn't need this remedy frequently and especially
    not in the first treatment....


    About the comments of the Norwegian Practitioners:
    The only thing I can say is that even when I was already together with
    Johan for a year, I still had to unlearn things and then learned ways to
    improve the effectiveness of my work with the Chiren.... until now nobody
    had access to a lot of the knowledge about Biontology that Johan has (he
    was not teaching or only very little) and so everyone started developing
    their own ways...
    (There seems to even be a Norwegian practitioner who only uses one remedy
    per Session and then works on people for years! This is not Biontology at
    all....)
    I have been treated by several practitioners myself before I could buy a
    Starlight and follow the course, and apart from the first Session that
    dealt with Vaccinations, Whiplash & Spin Inversion, which always give big
    changes (huge improvement in my condition!), they were not very effective
    Sessions... My first treatment from Johan was completely different...

    About Appendicitis not Clearing:
    When something keeps coming back, continuing to do the same thing can keep
    you busy for years.... This is a point where you start to search for a
    cause...

    What is holding this Inflammation in place...?
    What is showing up in your measurements...?
    What environmental circumstances are there...? 
    How do all the symptoms fit together....?
   
    And many more questions..... depending on what you've measured, the
    symptoms etc..

    * For some the answer is another Infection holding the Appendicitis in
    place (I have personally found that Tonsillitis, Kieferostitis,
    Diphteria.... can do this, but there are more possibilities)

    * For others the answer lies in their fridge (they maybe should put the
    Chikey in there...haha) or eating habits. They get Food Poisoning over and
    over again. Of course then the Intestines (Appendix) won't heal!!!

    * Then there is also Constipation itself that can keep Appendicitis in
    place...decaying Food in the Intestines that can't get out will not create
    healthy bowels. Sometimes I get Appendicitis back in my measurements when
    due to irregular lifestyle and lack of movement (Travelling, Airplanes,
    Jetlag) I get constipated for a couple of days. 

    * A major factor that holds every disease in place and blocks healing, is
    recurrent Spin Inversion (all healing stops - so treatment becomes
    ineffective from the moment the Spin Inversion is there), but sometimes
    also EMF influence without the resulting Spin can block healing... 

    * And then we have another big one that actually can cause Inflammation by
    itself.... STRESS... and the resulting exhaustion. This will too make
    healing less effective. Johan always makes clients aware of his 40%-60%
    Rule => "Spend only 40% of the energy that you have and keep 60% for
    recovery and healing!" 

    * And many more.....

    So you see, that again there is not just one answer. You have to look very
    closely to every individual case and find the right key. Johan is a very
    good detective, and you have to become one to get the quick results he
    has...

    Ok, i just had to cross Check. And i do understand that There is not one
    remedie for all.
    But......

    If it is tru what stands about dioxin, i can not understand that it is not
    To see offen. When i Google i can see that after 40 years children are
    still born with deffekts after they let out millons gallons with dioxin.

    http://www.ghorganics.com/Dioxin Contamination in Vietnam.htm

    I also know that people workin at platforms, have 4 times as high risk of
    dying of cancer....

    I also did see a program on The tv about dioxins in fabrics making jeans
    and The farmers around could not grow anything...... And The workers could
    not sleep and so on.

    So i keep on thinking why is it not offen a problem? I can. Also read This:
    seams like it is hard to Get it out of The kidnys......?

    The same features causing persistence of dioxins in the environment, also
    cause very slow elimination in humans and animals. Because of low water
    solubility, kidneys are not able to secrete them in urine as such. They
    should be metabolised to more water-soluble metabolites, but also
    metabolism especially in humans is extremely slow. This results in
    biological half-lives of several years for all dioxins. That of TCDD is
    estimated to be 7 to 8 years, and for other PCDD/Fs from 1.4 to 13 years,
    PCDFs on average slightly shorter than PCDDs.[1][50]

    I will leave it at This.

    Sleep well :-)

    Yes.... you are right. When you read about certain toxins you become a true
    believer in them, and are tempted to give them too much emphasis in
    Biontology.... I can go there myself...

    But the thing is, that ultimately you'll have to look at what in treatment
    gives the biggest results. And the fast track to recovery is treating the
    Overall Condition (Terrain) instead of addressing every single Toxin
    separately. That is just what experience has shown... Only when a Toxin is
    holding back recovery, it will be needed in Treatment. Usually only one
    time though.

    So the information you have read about Dioxin is not wrong and it is a big
    problem, however in the Biontology assessment/treatment it is one of those
    remedies to keep in the back in your mind....  If a client's ability to
    detox is improving though (shown in better function of eliminatory organs)
    after a couple of Sessions, you could add it once to assist the body to get
    rid of this specific Toxin and everything that is similar to it
    (homeopathic similarity). If it keeps showing up in measurement, there's
    likely a continuing source of exposure to a lot of Dioxin.

    Keep in mind that we are exposed to so many extremely harmful chemicals
    every day in the polluted environment we live in. It is hard to address
    them all.... and luckily it is not needed in Biontology.

    Yes, but unlike most of the toxins Dioxin is fat soluble. So it is a
    difficult toxin for the kidneys. 

    Spanish food has the highest levels of Dioxin and the Netherlands the
    lowest.... 
    Fish and Seafood, which Scandinavians eat a lot, has the highest level of
    Dioxin.
    I don't eat fish, so at home this was not a problem for me, but in Spain
    the level of Dioxin is high in everything.

    We have been using these Remedies once a week, because they gave more
    energy and because our concern about the Radiation...
    Plantago, Solidago, Selenium, Calculi Billiaris, Calculi Renales, Injeel
    Chol, Berberis, Sabal Homaccord
    After this combination of remedies, my daughter didn't wet her bed. But
    this only worked for a day. It continues to work every time though.
    I've observed her to have a problem with bedwetting every time when Kidney/
    Bladder are overloaded.
    Whenever there's a meal with a lot of Bacteria, she will pee in bed ;-)

    I will see if treating the food in the fridge will work.

    Also a friend from Norway with Arthritis, who went to the Senter for
    Rheumatism in Spain, felt a lot worse after
    I thought this was because of the Radiation back then...
    He had Kidney stones removed some years ago. 

    I have treated him aroud 12 times, without result. I followed some tips of
    Johan, but they did not do anything...

    On Google I found that environments that are polluted by Dioxin have the
    highest rates of Rheumatism, Cancer etc. 
    I think that because it is not water soluble it is more important then
    other toxins.

    Fat soluble Toxins are mainly detoxed through the Liver, dumped with the
    Bile in the Intestines, and then expelled with the Feces. Hardly nothing of
    the fat soluble toxins reaches the Kidneys. Kidneys expel water soluble
    Toxins mainly, some of which are first made water soluble by the Liver....
    but almost no Dioxin.

    There are more fat soluble Toxins then Dioxin (e.g. PCB, Parabens, Benzene,
    Heavy Metals, DDT, Bromine, Pesticides, Byphenil, Bisphenol.... and many,
    many more). If you would read up on any of these toxins, you would find a
    similar story in disease causing properties.... very scary for the
    hypochondriac, since we live in such a polluted world.

    So this doesn't give Dioxin a higher status....

    When there's a problem with Fat Soluble toxins, working on the function of
    Liver and Gallbladder is key. When they start to detoxify properly again
    the Fatty Tissues will clear of all their Toxins...

    Eating a diet without enough fat or with unhealthy/trans-fats (plastic!)
    can cause the Bile to stagnate, and the exit channel to block. So limiting
    fat because of a fear of fat soluble toxins is also not a good idea... 

    Your daughter's bedwetting, when I read your comment about her, reacts
    clearly more on Food Poisoning (Bacteria) then on the Dioxin in the
    food.... It is very likely that she has a Chronically Inflamed Gut
    (Appendicitis) due to recurrent Food Poisonings, that causes Intestinal
    Flora Bacteria to travel toward her Bladder to Infect it... 

    I do hope the "Chikey in the fridge" idea will help you prevent future Food
    Poisonings.

    Cholesterol is a sterol (subclass of steroids) which is synthesized by the
    Liver. It is an important building block of all cell membranes and
    precursor of sex hormones, adrenocortical hormones, bile salts and vitamin
    d.... 

    And what do you reduce to get the cholesterol better? Fat from food!!! And
    guess what cholesterol is also not a water-soluble, it is ldl that the body
    produce that pack it up and transport it.

    As long as the message is not fully heard... I'll try to keep everyone on
    track (If I don't this forum won't be any better then the old one, it is a
    teaching tool!!).... please read. I don't say that Dioxin is not an issue.
    I only explain how to address it properly in Biontology.... don't fixate
    too much on the one Toxin... I believe Dioxin is very bad... you'll have to
    avoid it. I am conscious of what I eat.... studied every diet in the book
    from when I was 8. Ask me anything...
     
    But In Biontology we treat the underlying cause, why does one person get
    sick eating the same amount of Dioxin that his neighbour has no problem
    with...?

    A lot of myths about Cholesterol.... But eating fat has no influence on
    Cholesterol, Liver function has. People who don't eat enough healthy fats
    get a lot of digestive problems....  but it is a balance, too much is not
    good either of course (but this is not about cholesterol).

    What does cause bad Cholesterol to rise?

    Yes that is my point.... And fat has Dioxin stored in it......This is the
    worst for the Liver..... So that is why it seems to work for them...

    Question:
    How offen has it been your first slot? Just try and then we will see......
    Easiest way there is

    Ah... I didn't fully understand your previous post. So you did mean that
    Dioxin needs a lot of animal fat to detox, but then there's Dioxin in it?
     Yes that is a concern...

    Dioxin is probably a big factor for your problems as I already
    mentioned.... just like other toxins often are. And they do influence the
    Liver... there is a certain threshold of what it can take... Treating in
    Biontology to best get rid of it is to first treat the Liver, then use
    Dioxin once and get rid of the source!

    I am trying to teach you the Biontology way, not to argue with you wether
    Dioxin is bad.... I do believe that. 

    But to answer your question. I have experimented with the toxins a lot at
    first because I had to find out many things for myself. I have tried Dioxin
    a lot.... Johan has too.... we both don't find it a big problem solver. I
    actually recently tried it on my whole family (I always have to treat them
    all when I come to the Netherlands...nothing..).

    Try it without anything else for some time (no support either and then see
    what it does). Best way to see what it does by itself.... but like you
    said, in Spain there is a bigger issue with Dioxin and neither Johan or I
    have worked there (but also in Japan it doesn't seem to be a big all
    solving remedy and people eat a lot of fish there..)

    Yes I can understand that if you give the baby Dioxin to detox.. did you
    support the Liver and Gallbladder? Or did he get Food Poisoning too?
    Salmonella can affect the Gallbladder too.

    But I do believe that is because you live in Netherlands? This is just a
    good conversation making thinking go on. 

    What I meant is that high Cholesterol might be caused by too much Dioxin in
    fat food.

    The observation about the baby waking up at Liver time, yesterday also
    makes me wonder if it was because of Dioxin in the breast milk (I did
    measure this). I have no drops myself, but am still detoxing...

    Doesn't the body need help?

    Well Johan and I just moved to California...

    When I really want to see what the effect is of a single remedy, I always
    take myself as test case.... I don't mind if something gives a little bit
    of detox. Just to see what a remedy does by itself (for true healing of
    course you need support too)... You should be fine since you already have
    reached a certain level of health through the treatments for a year...
    better organ condition. 

    Keep supporting the Children of course.

    And while you are detoxing, are you going to continue breastfeeding then?
    That might not be a good idea...?

    I really think you should listen to Karolina about how to treat. Your
    addiction to Dioxin isn't good. When a Biontologist start to think in the
    way you do, there is a very good chance you project your own things to the
    client and don´t solve the real problem.

    Just an advice, I don´t think Dioxin is a nosode. I think you need to be
    exposed to a very great amount of Dioxin like Treviso Itali before it will
    be a real serious problem that is causal.

    Your drops all over doesn't give us any chance to help you. Look at other
    cases in forum and describe very carefully what you measure else you can't
    get the help you need.

    From what you have described so far in forum I think you have to look at
    you own personal situation and see if there are any hints there.

    Liselotte:
    Instead of making lists, I try to teach the Biontology way of working and
    assessing, so that you might find the right answers in individual cases
    with your clients. 
    When you understand Spin Inversion is a combination of Low Energy of the
    client, and exposure to an Electro Magnetic Source... you can make a list
    of all the probable causes.....  (When the EMF wins from the Client's
    Energetic Resistance.... then there's Spin Inversion). 
   
    The list of things affecting Appendicitis, is something you could have
    created yourself from understanding what Appendicitis is, how the Immune
    System Functions, what Spin Inversion does etc... This is the true research
    a Biontologist has to do. Look at things from all different angles, gain
    understanding and integrate... this is Synthesis Thinking. My list can
    never be complete.... so I don't wan't to mislead anyone with it. I already
    gave a short list of important examples.
    Even Dioxin might be one in a rare case... ;-)

    Cecilie:
    I have deleted all five of your last comments... couldn't do it anymore.
    I'm sorry.. far too chaotic.

    Please next time put everything in one post in a structured way, and make
    it about Biontology. You lose sight of what the Biontology way of working
    is and are very chaotic in putting things together. 

    I do like your enthusiasm, but it costs me hours a day to make your
    comments, first of all readable, then through the chaos understand what
    route your thinking took, and then to formulate another answer that says
    the same.... since you don't really absorb what I write. I have never
    written that Dioxin isn't bad (actually you haven't written anything about
    it I didn't know, since I do have a background in Chemistry, Nutrition and
    Physiology)... read again and you'll see what I do say. 
    But maybe I'm not expressing myself clearly enough.... I have lost my
    energy and creativity to explain it to you in yet another way.
    I'm not here because I'm enjoying spoiling your fun, but because there's a
    real need to improve the understanding of Biontology amongst students and
    practitioners. 

    You might not like Peter's comment, but he is right. When you start to see
    the same problem in every single person you measure, projection is the most
    likely cause (and that does show up in measurements!). I have never seen
    two clients with exactly the same problems and causes. There might be
    patterns that are similar, but there's never a panacea... never the same
    remedy that cures everyone and everything.

    Posting Norwegian links is also not very considerate towards me or anyone
    who doesn't understand this language. I easily found the English version
    and replaced it in another post where you did the same. But instead of
    seeing all the work I put in there, you don't adapt your style of
    posting.... 

    http://www.biontology.com/forum/use-of-the-forum/

    http://www.biontology.com/vanilla/index.php?p=/discussion/21/
    how-to-use-the-forum#Item_16

    Also you can bring in whatever discoveries you have made or insights you
    have gained, but they should be solidly grounded in Biontology. First this
    understanding has to be in place... 
    Do you think Johan put Biontology together over night with a lot of
    assumptions, and there it was...? 30 years of experience.... behind every
    answer he has there are stories on how he found something out... how he
    tested it and how some assumptions he made at first were not valid.... 

    Many assumptions have proven not to lead anywhere. Biontology is something
    that evolved during treatments of thousands of people, Johan started out 
    without making any remedy more special then the other and then by testing
    with an empty head, he found out which remedies were most effective in
    treatment. When something didn't have much of an effect (although in theory
    -stems from thinking!- it might have seemed very important) Johan discarded
    it. He kept using what worked the best. Dioxin, or any poison is never the
    key in Biontology, but it can sometimes be necessary to treat them, just as
    it is necessary to support well, while it is the Nosodes that hold the real
    key to recovery. 
    There's a very good reason for introducing the Objectivity Class from dr.
    Elizabeth Thornton as part of the Biontology courses.

    So before you make your assumption into a fact, it needs so much more. Just
    continue to test for some time. Document what you measure (I haven't seen
    any measurement like other practitioners give from their clients, all
    dropping points written down, with the remedy next to the points it
    corrected). Through your complete measurement and assessment during
    different sessions, we can truly see how you work and if all makes sense.
    For now I advise to just see how things work out with your Dioxin adventure
    (don't lose your enthusiasm, but also don't lose your ability to
    distinguish truth from untruth and be critical in your analysis) in the
    long run, and then bring a good, coherent story that doesn't come from the
    internet... You might very well make a big difference with this for the
    people who live where you live! 

    Another Biontology insight: We are not helpless victims in a Toxic world!
    The stronger and more Coherent the Light, the less effect Toxins have on us
    .

Providing Structural Support

DennisOwensDennisOwens
August 2014 edited August 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client (male 28) 

I have been treating this man very successfully for vertigo after serious
digestive issue which he acquired while living in India. 

An unrelated issue which he is is trying to heal is a problem with a painful
bunion on his right foot. He wants to know if biontology can help.
He has had the bunion since childhood but it has now become painful.  I look at
a bunion as a structural issue which we, as biontologists, are unable to
correct. Nonetheless, I am curious to know if supporting structural change with
biontology can assist or speed up structural change. 

He is wearing a type of silicone toe spreader to try to alleviate the problem
but feels he needs to do more to correct the bunion.

Although we are in California, he has been speaking with a natural doctor that
he found on the internet in Colorado who has healed bunions using a regime of
the following:

 1. adjustments using chiropractic
 2. microvolt therapy
 3. topical anti-inflammation
 4. night and day splint 
 5. foot exercises
 6. works on gait and posture
 7. Acupuncture

He is trying to handle the problem in a similar manner in California and
without traveling to Colorado.

Questions: 

 1. Could biontology be used as the microvolt therapy portion of the treatment
    using perhaps the metal connectors with the scar treatment protocol?
 2. Would using a topical anti-inflammmatory present any conflict/
    contraindications to using the Chiren or Chikey in this way?
 3. I assume acupuncture would be a contraindication if biontology is
    recommended. Correct?
 4. Would you recommend using remedies such as Osteoheel, Calcoheel, Discus,
    Kalmia, and possibly Neuralgo Rheum Injeel either locally or on hand rod
    treatments? Any others?
 5. Any other ideas/ suggesstions?

    I would try all of this following first without doing anything else:

    A. The cause of any bunions is too much pressure on the foot, normally
    caused by shoes that are too tight. So the first action to take is to wear
    sandals or whatever that put no pressure on the foot.

    B. I have successfully used the scar protocol in the past with torn
    ligaments. So you can do this also on the bunion. 

    C. Further you can use remedies like Belladonna, Lymphomyosot, Arnica in
    the hand treatment to eliminate the pain and the irritation of the tissue.

    From the point of view of TCM, the 'bunion' is a result of a spleen/liver
    meridian energetic imbalances, the spleen is weak and the liver is 'tight' 
    so the big toe is pulled laterally....

What do you think was the biggest break through / insight?

Which interpretations made during the whole course of treatments would you
consider accurate?

Which interpretations did you have to let go because they proved not to be
effective?

Knowing what you know now would you have done anything different?

Did you learn something new?

Restless Leg Syndrome

DaphnaDaphna
November 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Symptoms:
High blood pressure
Restless leg syndrome

Medication:
Diuretics for many years (for high blood pressure)

Questions:
1. I'm wondering if anyone is familiar treating restless leg syndrome and their
findings?
2. I'd imagine there is a connection between the use of diuretics for high
blood pressure for many years and the restless leg syndrome?

    Yes, diuretics can lead to restless legs due to mineral loss (esp.
    magnesium). Does your client still uses the diuretics?

    You'll need to find the cause of the high blood pressure and treat it so
    the diuretics are not needed anymore.

    Most likely you will need to treat the Gallbladder (and when it shows the
    Liver). 
    Spascupreel has magnesium in it, and might be good as a support.

    Measurements:
    Kidneys often drop + need a lot of support
    Gallbladder drops
    Circulation => Barijodeel
   
    So all these stresses are adding to her high blood pressure...
   
    I'll look further to see if the kidneys have an underlying stress that i've
    missed. 

    Emotionally she has a lot of grief which I think is why her Gallbladder
    shows so much stress.

    For treatment on the emotional level you could use Metro Adnex, which
    contains high potency Pulsatilla, which is helpful in sensitive women who
    cry easily and frequently.

    Question:
    1. What about losing weight (she carries 100lbs extra)?. Are there good
    remedies to support weight loss? Or a weight loss protocol?
    2. I know the thyroid would be very important. overall I'm not seeing too
    many thyroids stay balanced with the Chiren. Any suggestions there?
  •

    Answers:

    1. To answer this question, you need to know the cause of the overweight,
    which could be:

    1) Fluid retention
    2) Faulty fat metabolism
    3) Faulty carbohydrate metabolism
    4) Thyroid, too slow metabolism
    5) Lack of Intestinal Flora
    6) Eating at the wrong times
    7) Too many Toxins
    8) Eating unhealthy
    9) Food addiction
    10) Female hormonal imbalance
    11) Not being able to let go, accumulating attitude
    12) ....

    2. I have never seen a Thyroid holding on to its problems. But you need to
    find the underlying cause.

    Thyroids are often affected by
    1) Pituitary
    2) Pineal
    3) Tonsils + Appendix
    4) Iodine
    5) Whiplash
    6) ....

    Sometimes you need to address the Thyroid at the same time as the other
    Organ Systems, otherwise they keep affecting each other. 
    This is true for many issues, which is why your assessment is so
    important.. integrating all aspects (measurement, symptoms, environment,
    lifestyle, reactions to the treatment....)
    When a problem keeps coming back you need a different approach.

    November 2013 edited November 2013 Flag
    I think her weight issue is related to ALL those points you mentioned
    above. 

    Questions:
    1. What corrects faulty carbohydrate metabolism? 
    2. Does working on the Gallbladder help to balance faulty fat metabolism?
    If so are there certain remedies for this? 
    3. Regarding the Thyroid: do you test with Iodine to see if they should add
    it as a supplement?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    November 2013 edited November 2013 Flag
    It is unlikely that all suggested points apply. However, IF this were true,
    you'll have to find the main cause...
    You will of course need to follow protocol to correct the whole metabolism.

    Answers:
    1. Faulty carbohydrate metabolism will show on the Pancreas meridian (right
    foot).
    For remedies, see the measurement protocol.

    2. Faulty fat metabolism is caused by Gallbladder/Liver problems.
    For remedies, see the measurement protocol.

    3. If Strumeel matches on the Thyroid, there is something wrong with the
    iodine metabolism. This is what you'll need to treat. When the Thyroid
    function is corrected the body might metabolise iodine better so
    supplementation is not necessary anymore.
    When after correcting the metabolism there are still indications of iodine
    deficiency, you might try to supplement. But be always be very careful.

    Question:
    Iodine metabolism can be corrected using? 

    I've had a few clients who's thyroid or iodine metabolism would not
    correct...

    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel

    Answer:
    Strumeel can correct Iodine metabolism.

    How to approach Thyroid imbalance:

    1. When the Para-Thyroid drops too => Whiplash treatment

    2. What I usually do when the Thyroid drops and it is not Whiplash, is that
    I measure the Pineal first. When this is the case and I find a remedy that
    corrects the Pineal gland, this normally corrects the Thyroid too.

    3. When the Pineal gland does not drop, but the Tonsil points on the
    Lymphatic system drop, then I look for (Chronic) Tonsillitis, Polyp
    Larynges.
   
    4. When this does not match I look if the Pituitary and/or Para-Thyroid
    drop. In this case Varicellen, Variolinum, Measles, Mumps, Diphteria can
    match.
   
    5. When this does not match I look for Toxins.
   
    6. When I don't find Toxins, then I'm going to look for "out of the
    ordinary" solutions like Appendicitis, which can influence the whole body.
   
    Note: not every possibility is mentioned! You'll need to be "holistic" and
    find answers through synthesis thinking, I can't provide you with all the
    answers. What I can try to teach is how you should approach a treatment.
    The steps have to make sense. Your assessment and reasoning are very
    important in order to be successful.
    The right order of treatment and the most common remedies used, are
    described in the measurement protocol.

March 2015 - Room Clearing

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
March 2015 edited March 2015 in Q&A Flag
Question
You have mentioned in the past that the rods can be placed on a desk with
Ozaliet, Space Clearing, Calm & Clear and others, to energetically clean a
room. How far do remedies travel when doing that?

Answer
I personally would not clean a room with Ozaliet. Ozaliet is a remedy that
strengthens the aura. It seems strange to apply that to a room. Also the bush
remedies are created to clear ones personal space and calm the personal energy
system down. A room is not a person and would need other remedies. Since I have
never experimented with clearing of spaces with the Chiren I cannot say much
about it.

But your main question is about how far the information would travel. In theory
the information would travel as far as the light can travel, so it would stop
where the light of a light bulb would stop. So walls would stop it. And all
dark spots in your room would not be reached.

Only when you use a photograph of the room as a witness you can treat the whole
room. Then there is no distance, and you can also treat the room when you are
not physically there.

    Practitioners of other modalities clear their room between clients with
    sage, Tibetan bells, prayers, incense, etc.

    Would it be advisable for Chiren practitioners to clean the room's energy
    with a photograph and 2-7 containing no remedies between clients? 

    If so, would it be best to do it once with a photo taken from one direction
    of the room and again with a photo from the other direction to get the
    entire room?

    Besides checking the treatment space and making healthy adjustments to
    minimize electric dirt etc. I wouldn't worry about energy impressions a
    client might leave behind.

    When the next client comes, we have our Measurement Pen, so we can already
    start clearing whatever is disturbing that client's light. I don't see why
    we would have to worry about clearing the space between clients, since they
    all just came from outside (and will go back there on their way out), a
    place full of other energy fields, unless we live in a bubble, so one more
    surely doesn't make much of a difference for your treatment.

    It's more logic to me to just focus on the body's own ability to heal, the
    client's energy field, so that this light is coherent and stronger to not
    be so quickly thrown off by other energy fields.

    If it was a concern like the importance of washing hands before an
    operation on a living being, endangering their wellbeing, then I would
    understand the greatness of this idea but in this case clearing the room
    with pictures in between sessions feels to me more like soaping your car
    right before you drive it into an fully equipped carwash?
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    March 2015 edited March 2015 Flag
    Agreed. The danger of Johan or me making any encouraging statement about
    this, is that it may lead to the assumption that this procedure is needed,
    and then will be adopted as part of the protocol, while it is not. 

    What I do like to say about this, is that you may experiment with it
    yourself as it will do no harm to anyone, but when you are teaching others
    I suggest not to make this part of these teachings. It will only lead to
    distraction from what is important and feed the illusion that it is
    essential. 

    Therapists of other modalities who clean their rooms, usually work with the
    energy of the clients, which might leave some "pieces" or "impressions'
    behind. Treatment with the Chiren is much cleaner. The moment a disturbance
    comes up in the energy field it is neutralized immediately, thus there will
    be no residues left in the room.

Enlarged Pituitary Gland

m3pollack
February 2013 edited February 2014 in Symptoms Flag
Client:
15 year old daughter of a friend 

Medical Interventions:
Tumor removal from her Thyroid 
Tumor removal from her Parathyroid => last summer  

Symptoms:
Enlarged Pituitary => 3 times higher than normal, twice as deep and twice as
wide as normal. 
Parathyroid lies in her chest => 16% of Parathyroids are found in the chest 
Acute abdominal pain and has lost 60 pounds (somewhat overweight before) =>
after excision of the Parathyroid

Medical Diagnosis:
The doctors tell the mother she simply has "a generous" Pituitary and there is
nothing they can do about it.  

After doing a lot of research her mother found:
Pituitary not functioning => no Cortisol release => causes sodium deficit =>
causes chronic dehydration.  

Question:
I'd very much appreciate your perspective and suggestions.

    * Did you already treat her? It would be helpful to have more details in
    this case.

    * What were her symptoms before the surgery and after the surgery? 

    * The Pituitary gland, controls the Cortisol levels of the body by hormonal
    communication with the Adrenals, and I can imagine that a lack of
    communication might play a big part in this like her mother suspects. 

    * Are there any scars either physical or energetic on the Hormonal axis
    (conception vessel / governor vessel or in other words central axis of the
    body)? 
    Many hormonal glands seem to have a problem since they grow tumours….

    * Might the body be creating extra glandular tissue to compensate for the
    lack of effect their hormonal signals have? And why is this…? 
    I think first we have to know more details before we can make sense out of
    this.

    * It is interesting that she has low Cortisol (has that been established or
    is it just something the mother suspects?), because usually if the
    Pituitary has a tumour this means there's more activity and a high Cortisol
    level.

    * Is it maybe possible that the Stomach meridian was damaged by the
    Parathyroid surgery, resulting in abdominal pain?  

    * This is a very interesting case and I do hope that you can give more
    information about her and also feedback when you start treating. 

    * Of course you first have to start with the vaccination damage that you
    measure like with everybody else and see if there's Whiplash or Spin
    Inversion.... Whiplash might also be an explanation for the disturbed
    communication between the Pituitary and the rest of the body...

Herpes Outbreak after Chiren Treatment

slevarekslevarek
May 2013 edited January 2014 in Measurement Flag
Client:
Woman of 52 years old, Has not had a Herpes outbreak for years.. After our last
session however (2nd session) she had an outbreak.
I haven't treated anything related to Herpes in the first 2 treatments.. I did
follow the protocol for the first 2 sessions..

Symptoms: Knee Issue (swollen + aches), since a past surgery, Lack of Energy,
Problems Sleeping, Extreme EMF sensitivity (doesn't use cell phones or wifi in
house, but work place (restaurant) has lots of WIFI. Feels the cell phones
everybody is using.)

History:
Repeated Tonsillitis and Ear Infections (lots of Antibiotics)
Scarlet Fever 
Frequent FLU (every year)
Fibroids in the Uterus (surgical removal at age 19 and 25) 


1st Session: 
measured, drops on both hands, gave Whiplash, measured again.. drops still..
did Spin-Inversion treatment)


Remedies:
Tetanus, Polio, Hepatitis A non B, Chronic Appendicitis, Plumbum, Metro adnex /
Myom Uteri, (drops on Bladder Meridian)

Footplates: Cerbrum, Viscum Thalmus, Selenium

Measure again.. 

Support:
Short 2nd: Ozaliet, Formaldyhyde, Osteoheel

2nd Session 
measured, drops on both hands, gave Whiplash, measured again.. drops still..
did Spin-Inversion treatment

This time.. she tells me she has felt more energy since the week before,
clearer head..

Measurement: 
no drops on Triple Warmer

Hand Treatment:
Nervous System - Aluminum, Fibroma Pendulum 
Gallbladder - Caluli Bil, Injeel Chol
Barijodeel, Chronic Appendicitis, Calculi Renales

Footplates: 
Berberis, Atropium, Apis (Circulation for knee), Selenium for her energy
All points were up.. so 

Second Short: 
cleaning of her AURA - Ozaliet, Electro Essence, Space Cleaning Essence, Crab
Apple, Causticum
This because she is so so sensitive.. and because both times now she is in a
Spin Inversion even after giving her Whiplash treatment..


Question:
After yesterday's visit.. she tells me about this Herpes-breakout.. where it
just has been years since she has had any kind of an outbreak.. Could the
treatment of her Bladder Meridian.. be the trigger of this??
She mentioned to me in her youth in our first visit that she use to get these
outbreaks.. but has not had one in 10 years.. So I am curious..based off what I
treated with her.. is there anything that could have triggered this??

    I believe with Herpes one need to deal with deep emotional issues.......
    Also the outbreak is a good sign...... It is breaking the dam and all the
    emotions are being released
    You could question her if she had a build up of stress. 
    May I also suggest that if you are close to her have a conversation on her
    resistance with intimacy if the Herpes symptoms are in her genitals
    I would look into flower remedies for self esteem
    Hope that helps as I have someone with the same situation
    Bringing light to the hidden fear is one of the causes to these kinds of
    ruptures.

    Herpes is also weakness of Liver So lets check what could have weekened her
    Liver?

    Many people have Herpes hidden within their systems and then in case of
    Stress or Exhaustion it surfaces. This is not necessarily only caused by
    situations of Emotional Stress, but also by Physical Exhaustion/Stress...
    or Stress due to EMF...

    When I overview your treatment you didn't follow protocol... You treated
    the Liver in the first Session!!! This is something you should never do. It
    is far too stressful to the body.. it is not the right order of healing and
    then it is not that surprising, that one gets an outbreak of Herpes or
    Shingles. 
    Also the first treatment you should measure very carefully on the Hormonal
    System, because often a need for Variolinum or Varicellen does show...
    Johan feels you might have overlooked it in your measurements.

    I'm also missing the proper support for the Organ Systems that needed it.
    Where is you Liver and Gallbladder support? Since you did choose to treat
    the Liver (don't do that again in the first couple of treatments...) at
    least you should have properly supported it.

    Flower Remedies are not the Remedies that are going to solve this problem
    (neither physical nor emotional..).

    Some other pointers:

    Short treatment at the end of the Session should be an exception and only
    done when you failed to correct the Hormonal System or Kidneys after you've
    done both Hand Treatment and Footplates.

    At the beginning of the Session, measure both hands and feet.... especially
    in the first Session to get a complete picture of the condition of your
    client. Before you do any treatment (also Whiplash everything should have
    been measured)

    If next time the Herpes is not dealt with by the body itself, use
    Variolinum. It might seem to make more sense to use Herpes or Varicellen,
    but Variolinum is far more effective as a Remedy to deal with a Herpes
    outbreak.

    Maybe there is a misunderstanding.. I never treated the liver in the first
    session.. please explain what makes you say this.. 
    I did treat GB,  Caluli Bil, Injeel Chol  Barijodeel, Calculi Renales 

    Since she has not had a herpes out break.. I never was focused on treating
    the herpes.. until much later.. I only mentioned this because it had come
    up after such treatment.. I did follow measuring all points prior whiplash
    or spin inversion.
    I did not do these automatically. I measured on both hands and feet all
    points, then came back and gave a whiplash treatment.. still points
    dropped.. then I did the spin inversion. And both sessions I had to do the
    same.

    I did measure for vaccines on TW both hands..  the Hep A non B.. simply
    showed to work on the drops of the TW.  But I am not sure I am
    understanding where you understood I had treated the Liver on the first
    session.. please advise.

    That second short session was on Standard >2 for the EMF sensitivity she
    was experiencing.. not the typical short session of 12.  This combination
    of remedies I understood was good for clearing the aura for someone as
    sensitive as she is when she is around cell phone, wifi.. at work.

    My goal was not to treat herpes at all as it was not issue for her.. Her
    issues were the swollen knee, sensitivity to EMF.., being tired and the
    uterus.. fibroids that she had in the past.. the bladder meridian was
    dropping.. and those 2 remedies (Metro adnex / Myom Uteri)  did bring the
    points up.. 

    Thanks for your feedback.

    You've treated with Hepatitis A non B --- of course this is treating the
    Liver, since it is a Liver Nosode! But I now understand your confusion
    about that.... so to clarify... don't use Liver Nosodes in the first
    session…. 

    It is extremely rare to find Hep A non B on the Hormone System, but if it
    was indeed needed, a Liver Support Remedy would have likely also corrected
    the drops. This is a temporary way around having to use the nosode and
    still balance the Hormone System. If the deeper issue of Hep A non B
    remains (which is likely) it can be addressed at a point where the body is
    already in a better condition.

    The second short session is even not necessary for the Aura, since you can
    put those remedies on the Footplates..... but I saw you also used "Ozaliet,
    Formaldyhyde, Osteoheel" in a short session....

    Variolinum and Varicellen do often show up in a first or second Session in
    the measurements....  just something to be aware of. 
    We have gotten several reports of practitioners (only in the US) who got
    similar experiences with a Herpes outbreak after a treatment.... Johan says
    he has never experienced this (neither have I), but he has measured a need
    for Variolinum or Varicellen often..

    I hope this helps to prevent this in the future... I have made the
    "Liver-mistake" myself in the past and can tell you I regret not knowing
    about it at that time. It can cause so much Stress that Blood Pressure can
    go through the roof or it can cause bad side-effects for the client, like
    you experienced....

    OK.. I understand now.. I am still unsure why this person would have an

    what I did?? you think it was the Hepatitis ?
    I will test again next week on here and will try Variolinum again. 

    So just so I understand..
     I can use Ozaliet on the footplate?  For some reason I remember someone
    saying not to use it on the footplate.. 

    thanks for your advice .. I have another person same experience.. I have to
    look over where or what could have triggered it as well.

    Margit:
    Even if there's Liver Cancer, you can't treat the Liver first. This is not
    the right order for the body to heal.... it is at least very unwise to try
    and do this.... it is very dangerous, especially when the Liver has such a
    big problem in the first place. 
    Just follow the normal order of treatment in these cases. This will give
    the best results and the least burden to the body when healing.

    Sandra:
    Chiren treatment does lift suppression... so this alone can trigger
    something that was in slumber for many years to surface. And then with a
    Lower Immunity due to too much Stress on the system (caused by Liver
    treatment in an early stage) an outbreak is not too surprising.... The good
    news is that this will be temporary and that with the Chiren you can assist
    your client to overcome the outbreak again...
   
    Ozaliet (like any other remedy) can just be used on the Footplates... it is
    strange that something else was suggested, since the Dyslexia Program is
    nothing else then an extended 2-7 years Program, that is delivered through
    the feet instead of through the hands.

    Yes, it is more a matter of not using too many Nosodes/Toxins/Heavy Metals,

Severe Internal Injuries

March 2013 edited February 2014 in General Questions Flag

Client: 14 year old girl, inner and outer strength but recently had an outdoor 
accident a few weeks ago and got a wooden stick into the anus, through the 
uterus, intestine perforated several places, through a kidney, and out of a
rib. She pulled out the stick itself. It was glazed with ice.

The hospital (2) said it was a miracle that she has survived.
Her aunt (a spiritual therapist) has given her a lot of healing and I have been
asked to help the girl.
The girl has little energy and struggling with infections. (Maybe intestinal
contents remains in the abdominal cavity?)


a) Can the Chiren do something with internal scar tissue and prevent layers
that grow together?

b) I have not Measured here yet. I think it is the best two give energy
treatment first, and Triple Warmer-remedies and Infections / Bacteria (or what 
I measure)

c) How can I pay attention to the organs to heal from injuries? Is it possible 
to do something that makes her worse?

    It is always good to really be aware of what has happened. Does the story
    make sense? I always ask myself that.  (because sometimes clients forget to
    tell you the whole story, diagnoses sometimes make no sense, details get
    twisted in communication etc.)

    In this case I think the route that the stick has taken, is very strange.
    Through the Anus, the Uterus and a Kidney?
    I think the Anus and the Uterus, yes, that is possible. The Anus and a
    Kidney, yes, that is possible. But through all three of them, that seems a
    physical impossibility. But .... who knows what happened. 

    How do you know that there are infections and where are the infections?
    Where and how was surgery done? External scars might represent internal
    scars but I need to know where operations were done, both internally and
    externally

    You write she had this trauma recently. How recently?

    The accident was in middle of february.

    She was operated at two hospitals, I do not know details.
    She has a poor appetite, much disgusted and intestines laid out on her
    stomach. She has low energy. She is afraid of be alone
    She had pain and went to the hospital again.
    I have not heard more from them, but  I'd love to hear your opinion on what
    kind of help Chiren may give people in this situation.

    Generally how long should we wait after surgery before a person can be
    treated?

    As long as you do not know the details I cannot give any advice.
    You can treat one minute after surgery without problems. You do not have to
    wait.

calmer at end of the week, hormone points get better each time. She is sleeping
well now, headaches have gone away mostly, skin has gotten much worse, almost
unbearable.

Questions
1. We keep measuring and treating salmonella, should this have been cleared by
now, 5 treatments? Is there something else that salmonella would be masking?

2. How can we get the eczema to start clearing up and not getting worse each
time. What am I missing?

    It is unlikely that Selenium and Berberis corrected the Thyroid and
    Parathyroid (2nd Session). Was there a reason to suspect a whiplash (fall,
    accident etc.)? Otherwise it may also be something like Chronic
    Tonsillitis.

    The drops on the Hormone System are obviously not corrected by the remedies
    you put in. The same drops appear over and over again. This could be caused
    if there was a Whiplash that was not treated. Otherwise you should look for
    different nosodes.

    Appendicitis Necroticans cannot disappear just like that. I believe there
    should still be issues in the Large and Small Instestine. This also means
    that there should still be bacterial issues on the Kidneys, but there might
    be other issues on the Kidneys too. The Kidneys are an excretion organ that
    could not be functioning well, the Skin is another excretion organ that
    normally gets upset when too many toxins are being eliminated through it.
    This is an additional indication that the treatments on the Kidneys are not
    working. Calculi don't correct that many points, and in the 6th session
    there was no treatment of the Kidney at all.

    Why did you use Strep/Staph on the footplates in the 6th session? They are
    no support remedies but nosodes, and there are also no indications in your
    measurements or symptoms that they could be helpful at all.

    There has been too little focus and too little looking back. You always
    need to reflect on previous sessions and their effect. If certain remedies
    do not solve the problem, you need to look elsewhere.

    Some of the measurements are not possible, so you still need to improve on
    your measurement skills.
    For example: the Diabetes point cannot come right with Little Flannel
    Flower. This point is always, without exception, only reaction to
    Gallbladder issues.

    Kidney and Bladder are also still not in order. This indicates Intestinal
    Flora, since the Large and Small Intestine are also still out.

    So my advice is to focus on the Kidneys, Bladder and Hormonal system. Then
    you should address the Intestines. Try for example Chronic Tonsillitis on
    the Hormone System.

    Do not treat the Circulation and Veins at this stage, they are not in a
    very bad condition and it is relatively unimportant now.

    Also, test the Skin points before and after a session, but do not treat
    them. You just want to see what happens when other systems are treated.

The Quality of Chiren How does one Know it's Working when not Yearly Serviced?

Beate
February 2013 edited February 2013 in Questions for the H.A.A. Flag
A customer of mine, a dentist has asked about the certification and follow up
on my Chiren. She is pleased with her treatments, it is not that.

Her husband , also a dentist, is more then negative toward Chiren , and he asks
about the quality of the item.for certification of regular service.

He also would like to know if the Chiren is etterprøvd (norwegian) I am not
sure of the english word.....but in German I will say  nachgepruft TUV  every

and from whom.

Then they would like to know if the weak signals from the body can tell the
real picture of the problem of heavy disease?

Their Dr. Med daughter has had many treatments with Chiren in another town in
Norway. She did believe in Chiren, but not any longer.

Unfortunately I discovered, the doctor daughter, is in TOTAL  spinn, once she
called me since her biontologin was not present.

 She also emailed, sms, and phoned me like crazy and was not able to listenat
all. Heavy spinn and emotional pain.

Anyway I needed to fill all this in to give a picture of the consequences of
the answer I give my client, since they belong to the established medical

system here . Norway is a small country :)

    Hi Beate, 
    we measure on photons and the family you refer to, dont trust the technique
    we operate by because they have not seen the result they want. Thats a
    pitty but also sometimes the case. Thats why Johan is putting a lot of
    effort to structure protocols and information given, to ensure even more
    result among therapists.

    Chiren reads the bodys own signals / photons when we measure the meridians.
    Their question on weak signals can read heavy problems, yes!
   
    The Family you argue with  have not understood the principle we work after
    and therefore confusing the discussion with mixing of arguments -weak and
    strong, heavy and light. 

    Every second 100,000 biochemical reactions take place in every cell. It is
    known and proven that this process is steered by electromagnetic signals.
    The light signals (Biophotons) that pulsate from the center of the cell are
    the origin of these electromagnetic signals and chemical reactions.
    If we want to change  the bodys chemistry, we must change the informational
    impulses of the light. 
    If we change only the chemical reactions for example with conventional
    drugs, then the cause of a problem may not be solved, Thats why we work on
    the information in the cells. Biophotons are the information. 

    If Chiren is opereated with good measurements, syntese thinking, and
    treated according to the guidelines of your protocol, the body will during
    measurements (more than one session) reveal the real problem.  

    If the woman has spin, and constant spin (every time you measure her?) find
    out why to be able to help.  Chiren treats spin with blood and in one or
    two treatments.
     It will be an outside factor that gives her spin constantly, on an
    unbalanced body.
    Are you going to treat her? 
    if so let us know  her drops so we can guide better. 
    Look at her environment and especially where she sleeps. Treat her
    according to the protocol and have a good look at her Gallbladder/ Liver
    when it drops..
     

    I dont think Chiren is registered as german  TUV. It is not Technically
    approved in Norway either, but: 
   
    In Norway Biophoton therapy and Chiren as equipment, is registered in
    Brønnøysund registeret. We did the work of  registrating and documenting
    our method of treatment, and then applying for national approval of our
    therapy with the government and then we registered Chiren and Biophoton
    Therapy in the  NLH (Norsk Landsforbund for Homeopraktikere Organisation)
    where all therapists who qualify with anatomy, ethics and Norwegian law of
    healing, can seek membership with yearly maintainance requirements to stay
    member. 
   
    This rises the level of our work into National standard approved. Our
    treatment is registered and approved by the Government as Complimentary
    health care. 
   
    Nora

    You know how some people like to ask questions....I like that.

    Just to make this right. My client, the dentist is female  (70years), she
    is more than pleased with my biophoton treatments for more then a year now.
    She has got a new life she says.

    Her husband whants the technical TUV . He is not the onely one who wonder
    what is inside the Chiren and how we  get technically serviced. He even
    question if the treatmend can be dangerous. He also ask for proof and
    research done.

    I have been a member of NLH for almost two years now.

     I will foreward your information and hope at least to clear something for
    my clients husband and their

    daughter (the spinn). 

    Also my client ask today :

     What if a tumor is measured, how sure can we be that this is the right
    tumor and nothing else?

    I have no problems, Nora, with the layers and the body diagnosing itself.

    I do indeed find it complicated to say something that I do not know about.
    Get my point:)

    I am very pleased Nora too see your quick respond on my request on the
    forum.

    Hello Beate,

    The technique of the Chiren consists of two parts. 

    * One is the measurement part that works with electricity and
    skin-resistance. This is used in other technologies as well. It gives a 
    reflection of the coherence of biophoton-emission, but is not the emission
    itself.

    * So the only thing we can assess is which meridian (connected to an organ)
    shows photon incoherence and thus  imbalance and which "information" (a
    concept that your client probably won't understand) will make that light
    coherent again. The remedy needed does not necessarily reflect the real
    physical condition. It works according to the homeopathic principle that
    "like cures like". 
    So if you would measure a nosode for a certain bacteria it doesn't tell you
    whether that exact bacteria is really present, but it is likely that a
    bacteria (same as the remedy or different) or disease causing factor is
    present in the body that causes the same symptoms. 

    * The kind of assessment that a Biontologist makes is not the same as the
    diagnosis a doctor makes. We combine the client's symptoms, life situation,
    environment and background, with measurements, knowledge of the energetic
    body, knowledge about anatomy and physiology, knowledge about homeopathy,
    insight in emotional patterns etc... This is something completely different
    then putting people in a box and then administering a recipe that fits that
    box. We can never tell clients that they either have or don't have cancer.
    That is just not possible by the measurements alone. If you have experience
    with certain medical conditions and recognise the symptoms you can combine
    that with measurements and can get closer to the truth, but since a medical
    diagnosis doesn't make your therapy more effective in any way (it causes
    projecting, since the focus might narrow down on this one issue) the
    protocol is not to diagnose.  

    So that's one question answered: The ultra weak biophoton emission is not
    measured itself, but since the quality of the body's own light has an
    effect on the skin resistance in an acupuncture point we can measure it
    indirectly through Voll's measurement system. This is scientifically proven
    by Popp.
    Diagnosis is not possible with the Chiren, we only assess which organs are
    malfunctioning and what remedy resonates with that condition. This doesn't
    mean that that condition has to be present, it can just be energetic. 

    * The other part is the biophoton treatment system. Since most sceptics
    don't believe in the possibility of light having any effect at all on the
    body anyway, how can they even think that there's any danger in it or in
    this case that you need to have quality control of the instrument (or that
    it is even possible at all)? 
    The dogma in the scientific world is that a photon is a photon (and no
    information is contained in it). It can act within a certain frequency and
    very high frequency radiation would be cancer causing. 
    But our own light emission has a frequency within the measurable spectrum,
    in their understanding this can never be harmful except if there's a very
    high concentration of same frequency photons like laser light cutting
    through something. You can't even see the light we're working with... To
    identify this light Popp needed an extremely light sensitive camera.
    Since nothing is generated by the Chiren itself and the light that is
    filtered, amplified and given back to the body is the body's own light
    (that no scientist would consider harmful anyway) no quality control for
    this is needed or even possible. Another thing is that the technical parts
    can have malfunctions which you will notice immediately.
    It is impossible to have variations in the therapeutic effectiveness of
    different Chirens. So if it works it works completely. There can only be
    variations in effect of Chiren treatment because of the skills of the
    practitioner working it. This is why we are now implementing quality
    control at that level.

    So to answer to the question: The technical parts might be subject to
    malfunction, but this will be noticed and then the Chiren can be repaired. 
    The light filtering and transmission function will always function as long
    as the Chiren works technically (starts up and runs it's programs). 
    If there's still any doubt, you'll notice pretty fast if a Chiren doesn't
    function anymore since then you won't have any of the remarkable effects
    anymore that you're used to as a Biontologist.

    I really hope that this Forum and the Certification Program will help all
    practitioners to become more effective in their assessment and treatment so
    less clients will be dissatisfied.

    There is no test program in the Chiren... what do you mean by this?

    I think the dentist husband, is more concerned about effectiveness of every
    instrument in treating and this can't be tested apart from having results.
    All Chirens function the same, it is the practitioners that make the
    difference. 

    The frustration that the therapy didn't work for the daughter probably
    plays a role in the questions he asks. But this is a quality matter of the
    practitioner and not the Chiren.
  • 
    Beate
    February 2013 Flag
    Yes I agree.

    The husband dentist would like to know how we monitor, update the technical
    parts in  Chiren, that they are not damaged and can cause any harm in the
    treatment. May be he thinks about his dental practice and how they need
    service on their equipment......and so on.

    His wife, also a dentist was very ill when she first saw me. Now she is
    well and happy, but still now and then in her mercury state.
    I think I have got the best response possible from the forum, and there is
    nothing more to say.

Adult Dyslexia Protocol

madelynlevy
February 2013 edited February 2014 in Programs Flag
I am anticipating treating a new client who says she has Dyslexia (diagnosed in
childhood).

Questions:
1. How does treatment for an adult with Dyslexia differ from the Children's
Program?  

2. After correcting any Spin Inversion or Whiplash if present and applying
remedies for any measured drops until those are clear, does one use the
Footplate/Dyslexia program from the beginning with Thalamus, Viscum and
Cerebrum as well as any other supports?  

3. Or does one wait until all drops are cleared and then deliver the Dyslexia
Program every day for a period of time with the Cerebrum, Viscum, Thalamus.
 For what period of time?

    The protocol for treating adults with Dyslexia is the same. 

    Dyslexia Protocol:
    1. First you do normal sessions to clean all other problems

    2. Then you use the Dyslexia Program daily with Viscum, Thalamus and
    Cerebrum for 10 days
   
    3. Then a break to see how things work out. Do reading exercises for
    dyslexia to observe progress.
   
    4. Then again 10 days, if necessary and so on.

Radiation Effects

Colby Borden
October 2015 edited October 2015 in Case Discussions - Student Flag
Client:
Woman Age 50. Hodgkins Lymphoma cancer survivor, who has effects from the
radiation treatments she was given at the time. First session scheduled for
next week. 

History:

  • 1984 Spleenectomy
  • 1984 Hodgkins Lymphoma
  • 1997 Herpes
  • 2015 Skin Cancer (scar)- on side of the neck



Post Radiation Conditions:

  • "Torturous Colon"
  • Digestive issues => swallowing
  • Hardening left carotid artery and possibly heart arteries => shown in tests
  • Pelvic and Bladder pain => Cystitis


Medications:

  • Zoloft (daily)
  • Acyclovir (as needed for herpes outbreaks)
  • Neurontin (daily for nerve pain)
  • Protonix (stomach)
  • Baby aspirin 
  • Aleve (as needed)


Question
I was wondering if there was any general information or insights on this case
before I start.  I know that I should follow the protocol regardless...
Any guidance is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

    The radiation was given 20 years ago. Do the conditions that were caused by
    the radiation still exist after all this time? Did they remain the same or
    did they evolve/change?

    The list of symptoms and history seems limited to what you/she think(s) is
    most important, but I need to know a complete time line and I need to know
    ALL the present symptoms. The medication she is receiving gives some clues,
    but likely there is much more...  

    On which part of the body was she radiated?

    Information after further inquiry:

    * Cancer diagnosis (October 1984) 
     
    * Major abdominal surgery (November 1984) => Spleen removed, Ovaries moved
    to Stomach wall => led to scarring and infertility

    * Radiation therapy => 2 six week courses of radiation => remission
    achieved in March 1985

    * Radiated areas => top of the neck to the pelvic area (front and back)

    * The symptoms (e.g. pelvic pain, hardening of the arteries) are chronic
    and ongoing side effects of the radiation received in 1984/85. Radiation
    was much stronger back then, thus the long term damage. It is typical for
    long term effects to show up 23-24 years post radiation.

    * The Bladder and pelvic pain began in 2007) => finally diagnosed as
    radiation cystitis (2014) 

    * Pain management => Gabapentin, Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy, Acupuncture

    * Residual anxiety and depression is the only additional symptom => managed
    by Zoloft since 1995

    * Sober for 21 years

    Were the Ovaries moved to the Stomach wall or did she mean the abdominal
    wall? I do not understand this part of the surgery.
    What is missing is the time line and symptoms BEFORE NOVEMBER 1984. 

    Advice
    1. Check with the radiation remedies if they match to any point. This will
    reveal if radiation is still a dominant factor
    2. The depression is probably caused by exhausted Adrenals
    3. Hardening of the Arteries is caused by the Parathyroid 

    I suggest that you check these things, but you have to take into
    consideration that she was already seriously sick when your time line
    starts, in 1984. The CAUSES have never been solved. So her problems all
    date back to the time before.

    Radiation can have an effect anywhere in the body. So you can test on all
    points, but of course especially on those points that represent the areas
    of her body that are most affected...

    From the time line I consider that the Large Intestine was faulty in the
    beginning, resulting in Kidney/Bladder infections. This was not treated
    correctly, therefore needing multiple antibiotics that only suppressed the
    whole issue and caused even more Intestinal imbalance. The Colon issues
    that she has/had post radiation were possibly the original conditions that
    were suppressed/never corrected.

    This Large Intestine condition has led to everything else, Kidney/Bladder
    problems, PMS/ mono (Gallbladder/ Liver conditions), etc, etc

    With this client I would follow the protocol, keeping in mind what the
    original cause is. Focus on the Intestinal Flora in the beginning followed
    by the Large Intestine.

    When at one point you treat with Penicillin all her original conditions
    will come back. The antibiotics are likely to be still in her system. But
    you should not use this nosode before the Kidneys and Hormone System are
    corrected and also the yang organs are in relatively good condition.

    Hi Karolina :-D

    I haven't had a chance yet to compare Chiren remedies with the ones in the
    book but I feel like some might be missing. I know only about one of them -
    Aspen. I can't find it in the remedy book. Can you explain what Aspen is?
    Is it really missing from the remedy book or is it just me and I can't find
    it?

    Hi Maggie,

    Aspen is a Bach flower remedy and is described on page 180 of the remedy
    book. Thank you for pointing out to me that something went wrong with the
    creation of the index. The person who did this for me forgot to include the
    flower remedies (Bush and Bach). I overlooked it when I did the final
    check.

    So if you find names in your Chiren that are not in the index I would go to
    the chapters about these remedies. Page 179 -193

Acute Bronchitis

Question
How do you treat someone with an acute bronchitis issue?

    Answer
    I would first treat Whiplash and/or Spin Inversion, and then follow the
    protocol as normal. 

    First address the Hormone System, then the Kidneys. Skip the Circulation,
    and look at the Intestines. It may very well be that, for example, TB
    matches on the Intestines and also corrects the Lungs.

    The coughing might be caused by the Lungs but could also by the
    Gallbladder, especially if the coughing is spasmodic. Sometimes bronchitis
    is caused by exhausted Adrenals. Also in this case there is no immediate
    reason to divert from the protocol.

Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus

joellegoldmanjoellegoldman
November 2013 edited January 2014 in Measurement Flag
1st Session

Symptoms:
Lack of energy (burn-out)
Carbohydrates make her tired (esp. bread and beer)
Inflammatory skin break-out on face => reacts on stress
Respiratory allergies (pollen, dust etc.)
Cold feet => sometimes blue or yellow.

Medication:
Antihistamine for respiratory allergies

Measurements:
Matched her symptoms. 
No steep energetic drops.. 
The very bad drops, the ones making hardly any sound, where:

Lymphatic system
Bladder
Adrenal
Kidney 
Peripheral circulation/veins.

Pineal + Thyroid => pertussis

I did treat with Poliomyelitis, Anti-Tetanus and Selenium 

Insulin/Thymus point (R) => gave me an idea why sugars make her so tired.

Questions:
1. I did give her poliomyelitis and anti-tetanus even though her pituitary
gland and para-thyroid didn't drop. Is this normal? Can I conclude something
from this?

2. When I keep treating her and her meridians become balanced again, can I tell
her to stop taking the Anti-Hhistamine? Is the fact that she is taking this in
any way blocking my treatment for her health and her allergies.

3. She takes birth control pill named 'jazz', this also helps for her skin and
heavy menstruations. Is this in any way effecting treatment or in the long run
her health/hormonal system.

    Hi Joelle,

    Thank you for the additional measurements. It is very important to be
    complete, because this gives a completely different picture.

    Comments:
    Low measurements are not necessarily "the worst points". Sometimes when
    there's bad circulation, which your client definitely has, the skin becomes
    dry easily and you'll have to make sure to wet the brass rod (and probe)
    regularly. But dry thick skin/callous can give measurement problems like
    this too.
   
    (Not directly related to your case: 
    Only in very degenerative conditions like cancer, low measurement of a
    point can have significance. But then only the point(s) of the cancerous
    organ(s) measure very low in comparison to all other points, and without
    there being any dry patch, scar or callous skin over that point. This
    usually means that you'll find 1 or 2 points and not many points on many
    organ systems like you have measured. 
    Never diagnose cancer this way though! We can only find clues that might
    point to a certain condition. When you find more of these clues, at the
    same time, pointing in the direction of cancer, this means that the chance
    of there being cancer grows. Another clue for cancer is measuring a Cancer
    Nosode on the Organ Degeneration meridian. But you can never know for
    sure!)
   
    It seems like there was indeed a Whiplash, since treating it cleared
    Stomach and Liver points. So the Para-Thyroid must have been unbalanced too
    while you didn't measure it.. So either the measurement was not correct for
    some reason (note that it is very hard to measure correctly when there's
    not a lot of Skin conduction, maybe the sounds were to low to be able to
    distinguish a drop correctly), or Endorphins were masking drops. Good to
    see that you treated with Poliomyelitis and Anti-Tetanus anyway.
   
    Support Remedies should be directed to the main issues you have addressed:
    * Because of likely Endorphin production and a clearly stressed Pituitary
    Gland I would have also used Viscum as a support.
    * When you encounter the very common pattern of Tonsillitis and
    Appendicitis (in any stage) it is good to at least support with Tonsilla
    Compositum and Anginheel. Chelidonium is also an important support for
    this, since it contains Belladonna (inflammation!) and Chelidonium + Fel
    Tauri for the Gallbladder/Liver.
    * When the normal detoxification pathways, especially Kidneys, are not
    optimal, the body often tries to detoxify through the Skin, which causes
    out-breaks. So the Kidneys definitely have to be treated. Because of this
    and since you want to address the underlying cause, you rather should have
    used Kidney Remedies as support on the Footplates than Skin Remedies.
    * Berberis is a very good choice since it is supportive to Kidneys,
    Adrenals and Gallbladder... all systems that need to be addressed.

    Answer to your questions:
    1. "I did give her poliomyelitis and anti-tetanus even though her pituitary
    gland and para-thyroid didn't drop. Is this normal? Can I conclude
    something from this?"
    This is not uncommon. You can only conclude that there is a lot of stress
    in the body, especially in the brain. (Medication, Toxins, Marihuana,
    Whiplash, hidden Spin Inversion...) 

    2. "When I keep treating her and her meridians become balanced again, can I
    tell her to stop taking the Anti-Histamine? Is the fact that she is taking
    this in any way blocking my treatment for her health and her allergies."
    Anti-Histamine is usually not a big "therapy blocker", so as long as
    there's a need for it she can continue to take it. Usually this type of
    medication is used to suppress symptoms when they appear.. When the cause
    has been treated and symptoms become less, there will probably less and
    less need to use the Anti-Histamine. 
    When the Whiplash your client had was causal in her allergies, which is a
    possibility, she might not need the Anti-Histamine anymore. But you'll have
    to find out how she responded on your first treatment.
   
    Another way that might help her to stop the Anti-Histamine is to loan her a
    Chikey with an "Anti-Histamine" Chikey card with Causticum (contains
    Histamine), Atropinum, Cutis Compositum, Chelidonium, and Mucosa.
    She could use a short program when she has a flare up...
   
    3. "She takes birth control pill named 'jazz', this also helps for her skin
    and heavy menstruations. Is this in any way effecting treatment or in the
    long run her health/hormonal system."
    The pill does not affect treatments. Since it is interfering with the
    natural functioning of the female body, it might lead to later problems,
    but that is uncertain. It is similar to other lifestyle choices... they are
    not healthy to the body but won't necessarily block the Chiren therapy.

    Thank you Karolina for taking the time to answer my questions so
    thoroughly, it's very helpful.

    Question:
    If the Pituitary Gland and Parathyroid where not showing drops because of E
    ndorphin production, should I have put Viscum/Plumbum/Atropinum to see if
    drops would start to show? Because I feel if this was the case, that I
    idn't have a good view of her situtation. Or maybe other points that seemed
    not dropping, where actually in a bad situation and I was not able to see
    this because of Endorphin production.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    November 2013 edited November 2013 Flag
    An Endorphin Mask is caused by a highly stressful situation to the body,
    when you address the cause the mask will drop. 

    Using the combination Viscum/Plumbum/Atropinum is a generalistic approach
    to lower Endorphins, but it might not be needed when the mask for example
    was caused by the Whiplash. Did you measure the Pituitary again after the
    Whiplash treatment? 
    Another reason for Endorphin production might be Spin Inversion.. in this
    case the Spin Inversion is not measurable as such. Yet another reason is a
    more extreme reaction to the vaccinations than usual, when you then put
    Poliomyelitis or Anti-Tetanus in for measurement or give short treatment
    with these remedies (2-7yrs) often suppression is lifted too. 
    Gallbladder Nosodes (Gallbladder problems cause/reflect stress) might also
    lift suppression. 

    The Endorphin "recipe" was created by the following reasoning:
    Viscum => To balance the Pituitary, which is the gland that controls
    Endorphin production.
    Atropinum => To relax the body, since stress (all kinds of stress!) is the
    cause for Endorphin production
    Plumbum => Because of the homeopathic principle "cure like with like". Lead
    poisoning causes suppression by effecting the nerves in a way that they
    release high levels of Endorphins.

    The Pituitary didn't drop after the whiplash treatment. But the appendix
    point was first not dropping and after the whiplash it did drop.
  • 
    Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
    November 2013 edited November 2013 Flag
    So the Whiplash treatment has relieved some pressure and lowered
    Endorphins, but not enough to relax the Pituitary completely... 
    Next time when you encounter a situation like this you'll have more tools
    and insight ;-)

    Thank you very much! One last question:

    Since I didn't measure a Spin-Inversion, if next time I wouldn't see a
    change in my measurements, could it be she has this hidden spin and is it
    wise then to run it to be sure?
  •

    When I go over your session I don't see a Hidden Spin Inversion, since the
    points did correct after the Hand and Foot treatment.

    When there's Hidden Spin Inversion, exactly the same points that you
    measured before treatment will drop after... You will notice this within
    the same session.

    I don't see any issues with the Lungs, so why should she have support for
    the Lungs?

    December 2013 Flag
    I may have missed something when I first read Karolna's post.  It's
    possible that she
    was supporting the Large Intestine rather than the Lungs.  This being due
    to the link with gut mucosa and respiratory issues. 
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    December 2013 Flag
    The respiratory issues in this case are allergies, and these have nothing
    to do with the Lungs (sometimes Strep or Staph infections can be causal,
    but there is no measurement that raises the suspicion that Lungs are
    involved..)

    I'm sorry for not responding sooner to your case… it has been overlooked.

    This man obviously has gone through a lot of stress and suppression and his
    body is still doing this.
    It has become a pattern allover his life.

    Answers:
    1.You could have tried the Spin Inversion program. Spin Inversion can be
    the cause for endorphins. Because of the endorphins you cannot measure the
    Spin Inversion.
    I would also treat for Whiplash
    2. Possibly
    3. These remedies are used for therapy resistance.
    4. You should have run these remedies anyway after you first ran the Spin
    Inversion program and done the Whiplash treatment.

    I have been working with this man for several months now and am seeing
    progress,
    however he is still experiencing symptoms of lower back pain and erectile
    dysfunction.

    At this point all meridians have been testing clear except for
    circulation. I have been working on circulation 
    along with other angles including the psychological. When fear was
    mentioned he said that his grandfather had died of Syphillis and that he
    believes that his biological grandmother was a prostitute. He often feared
    that Syphilis could have carried through to him. Thus far, I tested and
    treated Luesinum twice. 

    He claims that after taking a drug, "Flomax' for an enlarged prostate, the
    erectile dysfunction began ( a known side effect)
    Although he stopped the drug a few years ago, he still has the dysfunction.

    I would like to run a Neutralization for the drug.

    Questions:
     1. Since he no longer has the actual drug, Is it feasible to create a
        neutralized remedy of the drug from the name of the drug alone written
        on paper or perhaps a picture of it from the internet?
     2. If this is suggested, could you direct me to the correct link for
        making such a neutralization?
     3. Is it likely that the Syphillis is still present? Should I continue to
        run it repeatedly?
     4. Should I be pursuing other possible Psychological avenues or remedies?

    Answers:
    1. This has never worked for the detoxification of anything, so I would
    suggest to find another way. Best is to look at the action of the drug
    itself. 
    Flomax is alpha1-blocker, that blocks the receptors for adrenalin and
    noradrenalin. It thus has a relaxing effect and is used for conditions that
    we would say are due to Gallbladder disorders (cramping of blood vessels,
    anxiety, stress, impulsiveness, aggression…). It is more than likely that
    the residue effect of the medication suppresses and masks the real
    condition of the Gallbladder.
    I would start to treat with all Gallbladder Nosodes and Supports and than
    see what happens.

    3. When you continue to measure the same drops and the same remedy matches
    you should look for something else that does improve the drops.
   
    4. I would wait for the results of your focussed treatment of the
    Gallbladder meridian. This might also lift suppression of old feelings, and
    when then every thing comes to the surface almost spontaneously (just by
    asking open questions) you can direct more attention to it. 
    People who are traumatised to the extent that you can imagine your client
    is, have so many defences built around the real pains and fears, that it

    Thank you Karolina,

    During client's last treatment, even though there was nothing showing on
    the gallbladder, (and the fact that he doesn't have one)
    Only one drop on the nervous system. 
    Nonetheless I ran gallbladder remedies along with nerve remedies

    >12 yr program
    Not measured:
    Cal Bili
    Cal Renales
    Biliary Cirrhosis
    Cholysystitis

    Measured on Nervous System:
    Aluminum 
    Cuprum
    Plumbum 
    Mercury

    Footplates
    Populous
    Atropinum 
    Calcoheel
    Galium
    Neuralgo Rheum
    Neuro Injeel
    Gelsemium

    Report
    Client has been away for the last week so no recent treatment.
    Received an email today letting me know that he has developed Bromodrosis
    or smelly feet which he says he has never had before.
    Wondering what the cause / possible remedy for this may be. This client is
    always impeccably clean and well groomed
    I'm assuming some sort of bacteria or perhaps a reaction to clearing the
    metals..
    I am thinking about testing using 
    Psorinum
    Graphites
    Belladonna
    Mercurious Heel
    perhaps 
    Naglemycose

    Any suggestions would be appreciated.

    You have used  a LOT of Heavy Metal remedies for one treatment, and all
    these heavy metals need to be eliminated by the Kidneys. When the Kidneys
    get into trouble, the skin starts to take over elimination tasks and I
    think that that is where the smelly feet come from. Also when heavy metals
    leave through the skin, like you mentioned you can develop dysbiosis of the
    skin.

    The person has arthritis which means he already had weak Kidneys to begin
    with. This is far to much detoxification for his condition.

    Advise him to at least drink a lot. The next treatment I would be very
    careful with the Kidneys and support them well.

Vibrating Sound when Measuring

During Measurement Program.

    I have also experienced the problem with no sound and having to go back out
    of the present screen. It seems as though going back "resets" the Chiren to
    then be able to measure. I was not experiencing this when I first started
    using the Chiren. This seemed to have developed later.

    Has anyone had any problem with the sounding board (or whatever it is that
    makes the tone) within their Chiren? My Chiren just started to make a
    vibrating noise along with the tone and after that I am usually unable to
    continue measuring because the sound gets so distracting. Sometimes it
    sounds as if the tone is losing power and gets softer along with the
    vibrating after noise also. 
   
    I have tried the different cords, shut it off and restarted it, unplugged
    and replugged in all the cords, but it doesn't seem to make the tone less
    distorted. It will usually starts this awhile after I start measuring
    someone (as though it is being used or overused and getting tired). 
   
    Thankfully I have been mostly working with family and close friends, but I
    am afraid to take on anyone outside until I have confidence that this isn't
    going to continue to happen. And of course, I can't expect them to refer
    anyone with a negative experience either. This has been very distracting
    and gives the clients the feeling that the session isn't effective. 
   
    I have only been using the Chiren since November and it has remained set-up
    in one spot -not moved and carried around as some Biontologists do- so
    there has been no damage on my part. I don't want to give it up for
    repairs, but I don't know what else to do. Has anyone else experienced
    anything like this? Thank you for any insight in this matter.

    Hello Ronda,

    The vibrating sound can originate from static electricity in your treatment
    room, but also the floor. You can check if this is the case by measuring
    yourself and if it gives the vibrating sound lift your legs and measure
    again. You might find that with your legs lifted the sound is good again.

    I suspect that later on in the measurement, your clients takes their shoes
    of and then the sound changes because of the floor. You can use a rubber
    mat for this.

April 2015 - Itch All Over The Body

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
April 2015 in Q&A Flag
Question
A client I am seeing has itch all over the body that started in childhood. He
has no eczema or other visible skin abnormalities.
Other members of the family (all men) have the same symptoms. 
His sons of 3 and 6 years old also get this itch => only when they are tired.
The father experiences the itch mainly in the arms and legs => mainly when he
is tired, upon waking just before getting out of bed, and after drinking
alcohol
What do you think about this?

Answer
This appears to be a Circulation problem caused by the Adrenals and/or the
Liver.
Itch upon waking and when tired both suggest a Circulatory problem caused by
lack of Circulatory energy, probably caused by the Adrenals. The fact that the
itch also comes up after drinking alcohol indicates that the Liver might be
involved too. One of the symptoms of Liver disease is itch all over the body,
but then there is usually also a yellowish tone of the skin.
Another reason for itching skin could be allergy to something with which the
skin is in contact, like a detergent. This detergent can still be present on
the sheets and could be responsible for the itch upon waking.

    This is very interesting. 
    My daughter used to have that itch too ... no visible rash - just itch all
    over her body (but mostly on her arms and legs) usually at night or
    morning. She didn't test positive for any allergies. We didn't change any
    lotions or detergents.
    About 5-6 years ago I would get a terrible hand itch in my hands usually in
    the evening. The itch was very deep and unbearable. Also no visible rash.
    Just hands a bit swollen. 
    Is anyone familiar with my hand issue? Seems like it might be different
    from my daughter's and the one described above.

    I suffered from debilitating dermatitis for over a decade. When I wore
    shielding Silverell gloves at work and treated myself with the Chiren for a
    few months, the itch and scars disappeared. They are resurfacing a bit now
    but I was clear for seven months (have not been treated with standard
    Biontology treatments since late October). Take notice of what the skin
    comes into contact with. Wireless mice and keyboards seemed to cause
    problems for me.

    My hand itch was very random. The only thing that was consistent was the
    timing - late evening. It very much resembled the feeling of your hands
    warming up after being exposed to freezing temperatures for a while. When
    your blood vessels start to warm up and open up and blood starts floating
    it and it makes it itch from inside. But anyway... I haven't had that in
    few years. And daughter's all over itch has stopped too without me doing
    any changes.

    Twenty six years ago when I was pregnant, I had severe itching all over my
    body. I would often scratch my legs and ankles until they bled. Mostly at
    night. (horrible!) It went away after I gave birth. The same thing happened
    with my third pregnancy (strangely, not my second child). I had no
    yellowing of the skin. But it turned out years later that I had Hepatitis
    C, so liver can obviously be a major indicator.

Losing Consciousness

Sylvia
April 2013 edited January 2014 in Symptoms Flag
New Client: 42 y/o woman, who had 4 whiplashes in the past. (horse kick in the
head - adolescent years, car accident and two in recent years)
I saw her on Monday for the first treatment.

Symptoms: sore neck and shoulders (main complaint), 5 episodes in last 3 years
of suddenly losing consciousness (got hurt significantly because of this),
before falling she feels strange, loss of consciousness only lasts a few
seconds and then she is fine except for whatever bone/muscle she hurt upon
fall.

Medical Diagnoses: Allopathic doctors have no idea what is wrong. It is not a
seizure and it is not low blood pressure. If she has a chance to sit down or
lie down she still loses consciousness. There is a history in her family of
heart related problems.

Measurement:
Whiplash Treatment was needed (measured) 
No Spin Inversion. 

Veins
Circulation
Para-Thyroid 
Pituitary 
Pancreas 
Gallbladder
Organ Degeneration 
Lung 

Treatment:
Anti-Tetanus, Poliomyelitis, Atropinum, Bronchialis, Syzgium and Glyoxal.

Footplates:
Hamamelis, Aesculus, Mellilotus, Gelsenium, Neuralgo-Rheum, Osteoheel, 
Selenium, Cerebrum

I will be seeing her tomorrow for her second treatment.

Questions:
Any idea what could be causing the loss of consciousness. It is a major concern
since she gets hurt and it is very dangerous if it occurs while driving. She
says she is "about due for one." I am following the Protocol for now, but
anything in particular that I should focus on?

    Is there any pattern in where she is when she faints? Non-ionizing
    radiation might do this. It can also increase seizures and effect
    circulation. Is she sitting between 2 smart meters that are talking to each
    other thru her head for example when it happens OR in a WiFi hot spot
    (cafe)?

    IF this is part of it biophoton therapy can make her stronger so it takes
    more to trigger her fainting. She may need to avoid or limit exposures for
    a time IF this is a contributing factor. See EMFSafetyNetwork website for
    more.

    She is a dog trainer and most of these have happened in her home or
    outdoors. She lives and works in the country. There does not seem to be a
    connection with outdoor or outside influences. 

    I saw her yesterday and she still has drops in the cerebral arteries point.
    I am using the remedies that Johan suggested. She has improved 100% with
    her neck pain, stomach issues and allergies. She still has some shoulder
    pain but no longer has drops in her intestines.

    Client is doing much better.

    Symptom she had not mentioned before:
    Blurry Eyesight that suddenly comes up, followed by a Headache on the lower
    part of the neck (backside). 

    Measurements:
    Often Gallbladder, Several Whiplashes

    Question:
    Can the Whiplash be the cause in combination with the Gallbladder issue?
    I remember Johan saying that the reason Hillary needed those glasses after
    her concussion was because of Whiplash. 

    The good thing is that the client says it is the only treatment she has had
    so far that holds and that she feels much better after years of pain.

    May 2013 edited May 2013 Flag

    The Whiplash can definitely be the cause of the Eye Problems. 

    Whiplash can also be the cause of the Lack of Expression => Emotional
    Suppression => Gallbladder and Liver Issues => your Client's Symptoms

    Especially people that work with animals often have a problem communicating
    with people.

    Blurry vision can also be a Pancreatic problem

    Johan, you are absolutely amazing! 

    I looked all over what I've written but nowhere did I write that there is a
    total lack of expression but somehow you knew that. I had mentioned to her
    that you had said that "suppression is as bad as Cyanide" and she said that
    she was in trouble because she had inherited the lack of expression from
    her father. 

    Thank you for all your feedback. If you were able to connect the dots
    somehow and then come to the conclusion that you did about her lack of
    expression please let us know what the process your mind went through so we
    can learn to do the same.

    The Centre of Expression is located in the throat area, so when there's
    Whiplash expression is automatically blocked...

    Sometimes it also works the other way around... a Blockage in Expression
    can cause Whiplash.

Hearing Loss

Irina
March 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client: Woman 61 years old. I have seen her today for second time. She came to
be treated for her acute cough.

Medical History: Gall bladder removed (15 years ago) found a big stone. She
believes it is hereditary, since her both parents had Gall Bladder removed.
Lost her hearing on one ear (age 14). She does not know why, but thinks maybe
due to fear. The day before it happened there was a big earthquake in a place
where she lived at that time. The doctors told her that the nerve probably got
damaged.

Kidneys are definitely her weakest spot, even though she never had any problems
with Bladder or Kidneys (according to her).
She has so many fears: fear of flying, fear of thunder, fear of hight, fear of
dogs....

Question: I wonder if her hearing loss could be restored, since she didn't have
any physical damage to her ears.
Yes, she has calcification on Gall Bladder and Kidneys.(on 1-st and 2-nd
treatment).

    Kidneys are the Yin Organs that are related to the sense of hearing and
    also the fear fits in the Water Element. I think the cause of it all lies
    in the Adrenals.

    Good Adrenals will give enough power to the Heart and Kidneys to function.
    When her Heart increases in strength, she will get more self confidence and
    therefore less fear.

    Lack of Adrenal Power makes the brain work overtime and then the brain
    creates all these fears.

    Her adrenals were dropping at first session and good at second. I used
    Berberis and Selenium in both sessions.
    I would be curious to see if her hearing could be restored. She personally
    doesn't care much for it, since she lost hearing long ago, and all the
    doctors told her it can't be reversed.
    Her cough is gone..., that was her goal. I hope she will come again.

Local Symptom Treatment - Misunderstandings

Karolina BoswinkelKarolina Boswinkel
May 2014 edited November 2014 in H.A.A. Messages Flag
For some reason a message is put out there that a "new invention" has been done
about localised Treatment to alleviate symptoms, and that we are against that.

Why is this a false assumption?
Johan himself has taught localised Treatment long before coming to the US. So
how some practitioners have come to think they invented this whole new thing,
and especially how we are against it puzzles me. It has however always been
taught with an emphasis on it's proper position within the protocol, namely as
just an additional treatment, which can be done after the fundamental
measurement and treatment, and without remedies in there. It is symptom
treatment, and as such there's no problem with it. I often use localised
treatment myself to temporarily alleviate the symptoms while the underlying
Cause is healing. But it should never overshadow looking for the Cause.

I urge everyone to read the reasoning behind some of things we teach, instead
of assuming there's an authoritarian motive. Our main motive is that we are
just very careful with our Clients, who we believe -as probably all of you
believe- should be number 1 in our treatments and should be treated with all
the possible care and awareness possible.


So why do some people belief they are restricted by us in doing localised Scar
Treatment?

We have urged Caution!
1. Remedies that are offered to the body in a local treatment will affect the
whole body just as well as when you put them in the hand/foot-treatment, so
there will be no extra advantage as to putting them there instead of in the
supportive footplate treatment, but they will add up on the total of remedies
used. LINK

2. What several practitioners have been doing is that the remedies are offered
to the body as an EXTRA. Overdosing on remedies is a serious matter, which in
some people might form a risk for the wellbeing of the client. It is reckless
just to add another 8 remedies on top of the 16 given in the hand and footplate
treatment.
So yes we did warn for this. Overdosing will 99 times out of 100 not lead to
any serious side-effects, but you don't want to have that one serious problem
(e.g. Kidney failure due to too much detox, blood vessel rupture due to too
much stress driving blood pressure up in someone with weak vessels). 
When following the protocol there is no such danger, and that is why we urge to
do so and that is also why we want to dissociate ourself from people who are
willingly creating a risk for clients and indirectly for their fellow
practitioners. We want everyone to safely call themselves a Biontologist and
also be safe when they visit a Biontologist.

3. If a series of (support)remedies is offered to the body before searching for
nosodes, these remedies might mask all drops, and hence the underlying Cause.
Since it is the Cause we are after and we want to permanently free clients of
their symptoms this is detrimental to the effectiveness of the Biontology
session. Biontology is developed to solve the disease at it's root, not to hide
symptoms.

4. Since we try to optimise effectiveness of treatment, we need focus. Putting
in random remedies will disperse the body's healing energy.

I understand that it is normal that many things will get twisted when they pass
on from person to person, so please come to us if you don't understand why we
keep things outside of the Biontology protocol. Our aim is always to teach what
is most effective and safe, and there will usually be a good explanation
available as to the why? of things.

    Also I would like to emphasise that the Light is the main healer always. 
   
    Localized symptom treatment gives AMAZING alleviation without any need for
    remedies.

    Someone I know who has a Chikey, but no cards, uses it on her joints
    whenever they swell up and are painful. She uses the Scar Treatment with
    rods on both sides and the symptoms are gone almost immediately.

    So my question is why in your Biontology treatment waste all that space
    with needless remedies, while you can also use the slots to focus on the
    real Cause (in this case the Kidneys)?

    We, the therapists, are making the difference between a Chikey-treatment
    and a Chiren-treatment. If you really want to be a musician you need to
    understand how to play the instrument, right now it breaks my heart to see
    the Chiren is often used as a CD-player (recipes). 

    The Chiren is the instrument, the Chikey the CD-player (not to
    underestimate the power of it's effectiveness of course but just as an
    analogy to make aware how important therapeutic skills and understanding
    are).

Hypothyroidism - Dyslexia Program - Update Procedure

Questions:
1. What remedies or treatment do you recommend for hyperthyroidism?
2. I remember that one needs to correct the Parathyroid first and then the
Thyroid.
Is this also true for elevated metabolism?
3. The Dyslexia treatment was designed for dyslexia, what is it in the program
that helps during normal treatment?
4. I can't figure out how to update the Chiren with the last two updates. Were
there more updates that should have been installed first? Please advise.

    Hello Merete,

    I have edited your questions and forwarded the question about Q&A
    invitations to Robert of Health Angel Academy. I did not fully understand
    your question 2 and hope I did interpret it right. Please correct me if you
    meant something different.

    Next time it would be helpful to have all these different subject put under
    different categories so they will be easy to find for other practitioners
    as a future reference. This forum is intended to make as much information
    available to all practitioners as possible.

    Answers will follow when I have discussed the questions with Johan.

    Answers:
    1. First you need to correct the Thyroid point. Maybe there's whiplash,
    maybe you need nosodes. A good remedy for hyperthyroidism that has proven
    its worth in biophoton therapy many times is Strumeel.
   
    2. Elevated metabolism can be be caused by the Thyroid. One can easily
    treat both glands at the same time. According to protocol, the Hormone
    System should be completely balanced at the end of the first session. 

    3. The Dyslexia treatment balances Pituitary and Pineal glands. Experience
    has shown that when this program is used in addition to the standard hand
    treatment the total of sessions needed drops with about 40%. Also there are
    far fewer negative reactions. This is why the footplate treatment should
    never be skipped when treating teenagers and adults.
   
    4. What was the last update that you did install?

    update. When I did not have Zinc in Chiren, I realized that the update was

    1.00.01 is the latest update, if you see this version in your System Setup
    => System Info of your Chiren the installation was fine.

    There is no Zinc in the new update, but "Zincum Valerianicum".

    The Dyslexia program helps with Dyslexia by balancing the right and left
    brain hemispheres. The procedure and more information is described in the

Metastasized Kidney Cancer

TorilJelterTorilJelter
February 2015 edited March 2015 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
60 year old male

Medical Diagnosis:
Kidney cancer with metastasis to one vertebra and lungs
Doctor's prognosis => 1-2 years to live

Sessions:
I only found Lung meridian drops once => Staph matched since then its clear.

Response to biophoton treatments:
After a series of sessions he feels better and is finally able to mostly stay
out of Spin Inversion.
However, he now has Lung metastases.

Questions:
1. Has anyone had a similar case that got better with biophoton therapy?

2. I know biophoton therapy can improve circulation and Kidney cancer loves
good circulation....could biophoton therapy possibly contribute to the spread?

3. Client wants to take chemo now. Sutent-a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.(prevents
growth of blood vessels to tumor) So that means I need to stop treating during
chemo. Right? Can I at least do a weekly assessment to see how things develop?

    2. Fear of spreading is not necessary when the underlying cause has been
    removed. Feeling better is no guarantee that you addressed the cause
    though, this can just as well be symptom treatment. 
    Normal, healthy circulation should not be feared, and is even necessary for
    healing. Speeding circulation up by for example jogging or heat is
    something different..  Biophoton treatment, if it is done according to
    protocol, will not speed up circulation or raise blood pressure beyond
    normal. So no worry is needed when you follow protocol.
   
    3. You can still treat, but treatment may be less effective. The cancer is
    likely a cýst. Kidneys are known to have cysts. So check for the cause, to
    see what type of cancer it is.
    If the Kidney's function is impaired, one must reserve treatment for the
    Kidneys anyway.

    Questions from Toril in bold text:

    1. Since you haven't had a client like this, do you base your comments on
    experiences with other conditions and assume they are the same/similar?

    Even though there are many different locations of tumours and also many
    different diagnoses of cancer, when taking a helicopter view, observing
    energetic interplay and the evolution of physical symptoms, the processes
    that underly the formation of the tumour are always the same.
    It is these processes that one should worry about and not the tumour
    itself. This is what I mean by the cause. The tumour is only the symptom,
    so even when the tumour is gone the underlying cause may still be present
    and in time cause a new tumour.

    There are various processes that can lead to the formation of a tumour.
    From the type of tumour one can determine what processes must have taken
    place.

    2. Client is doing better than doctors expected.
    Prognosis was he would never return to work, he works part-time now.
    Kidney function blood work is normal (But it has always been normal)
    Cholesterol has come down.
    Liver tests were abnormal during hospital stay-now normal.
    Of course the structural damage to his back will be an ongoing discomfort.
    How do I know I have treated the underlying cause?

    At least the systems that you have assessed to be causal have to be
    balanced and all symptoms should be gone.
    But since all systems are interrelated, in practice you should continue to
    treat until there are no more drops, or just a few that only appeared
    recently. What I mean by this is that when for example there were no drops
    on the Small Intestine the previous session, but now there is one drop,
    this is not a problem. But when there is one drop on the Small Intestine
    that has been dropping throughout all sessions and has never been balanced
    even once, this means that there is a persistent problem that still needs
    to be addressed.

    3. I have treated this client weekly since one month after surgery (10/9/
    14)
    Surgery was to remove a Kidney metastasis from a vertebra (1/2 the vertebra
    was removed and 2 foot long titanium rods placed and 15 screws) initial
    surgery to remove the 'primary' kidney tumor was 10 months earlier-
    prognosis at that time was considered 'excellent'. At surgery initial tumor
    was solid.
    When you suspect a Cyst you mean you think the tumor is energetically a
    cyst right?

    It means that in the process of tumour formation, all started with a cyst.
    When it has become a tumour it is no longer a Cyst, but energetically this
    quality can still be measured.

    4. I find it odd in this client that the Kidneys only dropped twice. Early
    on Cystopyelonephritis matched. The second time Kidney support balanced
    Kidney meridian.

    What we measure are the FUNCTIONS of the kidney. If there are no more drops
    ( if measurements are OK), then the functions of the kidneys should be OK.
    Because the cause of the tumour is likely not to be in the Kidneys, then
    the drops must be found elsewhere.
    If you find Bacteria Coli in the Kidney, they cause Kidney malfunction. But
    the cause is not the bacteria and is not the Kidneys. Cause lies in the
    Large Intestine from where the Bact, Coli was forced to leave.
    Cause is not one of the bacteria you mention under point 4. It is never a
    bacteria that causes cancer, it is a system like Circulation or the Liver.
    If Kidney support clears the Kidney points, then it is likely Toxins that
    got stuck in the Kidneys.

    5. Which of the following might be the cause of the Kidney cancer?
    Frequent Spin-Inversion, Anti-Tetanus, Polio, Thyroidea, Ulcus Ventriculi,
    Ulcus Duododeni, Gastritis, Plumbum, Cadmium, Strontium, Barijodeel, Calc
    Bil, Calculi Renales, Botulism, Chronic Tonsillitis, Tonsillitis, Staph,
    Brucella Abortus Bang, Listeriosis, Mercury. I am trying to understand your
    use of the word 'cause'.

    None of these can be used in a causal sense (except for Spin Inversion).
    Remedies/nosodes are never the cause, they reflect the factors that may
    have led for a system to become imbalanced, but the imbalance of the system
    or organ itself is what is the cause of the actual illness. So the
    imbalance of the organ is what you need to focus on.

    Two of examples:
    * The cause for Cyst formation may be Circulation, but if there is
    calcification of the Circulatory system, the Parathyroid is the underlying
    cause. You may improve circulatory function by remedies like Barijodeel and
    Aurumheel that assist in removing calcifications, but as long as the
    Parathyroid continues dropping you haven't addressed the real cause.
    * Another example. Penicillin causes Intestinal Flora problems, this leads
    to a decreased immune function of the Intestines and all kind of systemic
    causes for disease. Appendicitis is a possibility, which also blocks the
    Intestinal Flora from restoring itself, and the "escaped" Intestinal Flora
    Bacteria can cause all kind of infections elsewhere. For example in Kidneys
    and Bladder.
    In this case you could say the initial event that led to Bladder infection
    was Penicillin. However, treating with Penicillin will do nothing. The
    cause for all Bladder symptoms right now is the inflammation of the
    Intestine and lack of Intestinal Flora. So you may treat the Bladder as
    much as you like, but as long as the Large Intestine is not balanced and
    repopulated with Intestinal Flora, the infections will continue to return.

    6. Now I am informed this client lives in an area of significant geopathic
    stress. Would you now say this is the cause?

    The measurements, if they are correct and complete, can also give an
    indication as to what has happened,
    Geopathic stress can cause cancer if the disturbance field is immediately
    below the place of the cancer (when lying in bed for example), but a wider
    area of geopathic stress does not cause cancer as far as I know. If
    geopathic stress causes growth of a tumour it must be very localised.

    7. His biophotons are mostly balanced -although the most recent measurement
    was after 2 tylenol and a valium for muscle spasm so I'm not sure about
    these good measurements. Pain was a 4 of 10 so maybe some endorphins on
    board.

    If there are no drops after taking the Tylenol or Valium, it is very
    questionable if the measurements can be trusted. Painkillers indeed create
    endorphins.

    8. I plan to not treat for awhile and see how he does on the chemo. His
    choice. In a patient that takes thyroid medication after some biophoton
    sessions the need is less and then they can stop medication and thyroid
    tests are normal. Will chemo be more 'potent' in a patient that has had
    biophoton sessions? Does that mean the side effects could be worse? A
    cancer doc says side effects are less with biophoton sessions. Does anyone
    have experience with this?
   
    The chemo is nothing but intoxication, causing a lot of stress to the body,
    thereby creating endorphins through which everything is suppressed. When
    somebody does chemo, the results are most of the time disastrous. Very
    often the next phase is Liver Cancer, caused by the chemo. If people then
    die, they die of the chemo not of the cancer.

    The side effects of the chemo are less when you support the excretion
    organs with biophoton sessions. The chemo will to a large extent be stored
    in the Liver. Detox is essential but chemo puts more toxins in than the
    body can excrete even with biophoton sessions. 
    I do not think the chemo will be more potent however, since the body will
    try to eliminate the toxin as soon as possible and will possibly be able to
    do this faster because of the sessions. The biophoton treatments might keep
    the detox up and reduce damage.

    Your treatment should focus mainly on support of the detoxification and
    healing of organs affected by the chemo. It is very important to be very
    gentle with treatment and not to overdose.

    Update
    Client stopped biophoton sessions and started chemo => a daily Sutent 50 my
    tablet. 
    Client now wants to restart Sutent at a lower dose 37.5 mg in 2 weeks (for
    4 weeks) and restart weekly biophoton sessions. 

    Symptoms developed after 3 weeks of Chemo:
    High blood pressure
    Severe headache
    Throwing up a toilet bowl of blood

    Medical Interventions:
    Client was hospitalized. 
   
    Medication:
    2 Blood Pressure Drugs 
    Dexilant 
    Calcium Channel Blocker 

    I think it would have been better if I continued biophoton sessions. I will
    restart once I get my repaired Chiren back. Meanwhile I will use my
    Chikey. 

    Questions:
    1. With all this medication biophoton sessions will be less effective. Do
    you agree with the following treatment plan or can you suggest something
    better?

    Chikey Treatment Plan:
    1 x Spin Inversion Program => blood
   
    1 x Adult Standard Program with Chikey card => Solidago, Reneel, Populus,
    Plantago, Chelidonium, Atropinum, Injeel-Chol, Hepeel (to support detox +
    Kidneys, Liver and Gallbladder)

    1 x Dyslexia program with Chikey card => Barijodeel, Aurumheel, Galium, Nux
    Vomica, Veratrum, Ulcus Ventriculi, Ulcus Duodeni (to support
    circulation-client is often cold and to try to prevent upper intestinal
    tract from bleeding)

    2. Do you think I should have Selenium & Berberis in there instead of
    something else? I think I should.

    3. Does the above suggestion sound 'gentle and not overtreating' ?

    4. What would you do? Biophoton sessions only?

    In the first place it is clear that the chemo medication causes problems
    that might be worse than the original problem.
    My recommendation is that the client reports his "side effects" to the
    doctor and asks for a change in medication or I would recommend to ask if
    at least the oral drugs can be stopped since his digestive tract is clearly
    not capable of handling tablets. Tablets of any kind are bad for the
    digestive system and in this case they also caused bleeding..

    High blood pressure medication is generally very bad for the Kidneys,
    thereby possibly making the condition of the Kidneys worse...

    Answers:
    1. The Chikey cards that you suggest are indicative of detox. 
    In the footplate program I would suggest more Stomach support remedies and
    remedies for the Mucous Membrane problems to combat the acid reflux effects
    for which he also takes medication.

    2. I would not necessarily use Selenium. Berberis is indicated for Kidney,
    Gallbladder, Adrenal Cortex problems and I would use it instead of Hepeel.

    3. Since the remedies you use are all supports, and you only use one hand
    treatment and one footplate treatment I do not fear overdosing.
   
    4. Personally I would prefer to do biophotons only and no medication. But
    of course you cannot advise such a choice. 
   
    Again: The tumour is not that important, it is the processes that cause the
    tumour that are far more relevant (in this case most likely Circulatory
    issues => leading to Cyst formation => leading to Cancerous Tumour).

    After a 2 month pause client wants to resume supportive biophoton therapy
    AND continue chemotherapy. Lung tumors are shrinking. He has received
    sporadic Chikey treatments in addition to chemo.
    I understand I can offer supports in one hand treatment and one foot
    treatment. 

    Question:
    1. Can you also confirm that it is OK to do Spin Inversion / Whiplash /
    Scar Treatment if needed? 
    2. The main thing to avoid is the nosodes as long as he is prioritizing
    chemo over complete biophoton sessions?
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    May 2015 edited May 2015 Flag
    Answers:
    1. This is OK
    2. Yes, I would use supports for Kidneys, Lymphatic System, Circulation/
    Veins etc.
    But the Hormone System always needs to be right, so you may use the
    vaccination nosodes to correct the Hormone Glands. But apart from this your
    focus should be on supporting the elimination organs.

    Concerning this matter of chemo - if one is dealing with a person, post
    chemo, would the precaution be the same, that is, to focus on supports for
    the Kidney, Lymph and Circulation/Veins?  Or would one start the protocol
    as usual? 
  • 
    Johan BoswinkelJohan Boswinkel
    June 2015 Flag
    There is no or...
    Post chemo you follow the protocol as usual with a focus on Kidneys, Lymph
    and Circulation/Veins. But checking and supporting the Kidneys is always
    essential and Circulation/Veins are also positioned high on the list.

    When somebody has had chemo, the toxic load of the body is at least double
    of what a "normal" body would have. The burden on the excretion systems is
    huge so you need to give it additional support.
    At the same time you must focus on the likely cause of the cancer, not so
    much on the cancer itself.

High Blood Pressure

rondajmcdougalrondajmcdougal
January 2014 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
Client:
74 year female. Wants to try to get of all medication. She is positive about
Biophoton treatment. I did 3 Sessions on her and now she will wait for the
blood test to prove results.

1 child, 3 siblings

Relationship to 2 siblings who are still alive:
Not close, does not want to be around them too long, since it is hard and she
doesn't enjoy it.
Depends on them because she does not drive
Feels like they have personality issues

Vaccinated as a child.
High Blood Pressure diagnosed 6 years ago => during doctor's visit for Bladder
discomfort (received medication for both issues)
Did not see a Dr. for at least 28 years prior to this

Blood Pressure drugs
High potency potassium tablet
1 Prescribed drug she used caused Kidney damage => switched medication
Allergic reaction to pill that contains sulphur => can not use anything with
sulphur ever again
Doctor wants to prescribe bone density medication => client doesn't want to
take it

Emotional Symptoms:
Complains A LOT about her siblings => "everything is their fault"
Lots of fear, for many things
Anxious about future difficulties => always busy to prevent issues BEFORE they
happen
Can't let go of things that happened once => feels that they will happen again
Focussed on negativity => keeps pointing it out
Finds faults in everyone (mainly subjective)
Fear of doctors

Physical Symptoms:
Dentures since early 30's (all teeth pulled)
High Blood Pressure
Allergy to Sulphur (discovered due to reaction to Blood Pressure medication)

1st Treatment (January 6th)

General Approach:
Client was very nervous, because everything medical makes her "uptight" so I
did my best to give her a sense of peace about things.
This client was very nervous on the first treatment, so I am surprised to have
been able to measure at all.

Scar Treatment => 2 small spots on hand

Measurement:
Small Intestine (L) - all points
Heart (L) - all points
Triple Warmer (L) - all points except Pituitary
Organ Degeneration (L) - faulty vegetative control
Large Intestine (L) - 3 points

Small Intestine (R) - 4 points
Triple Warmer (R) - all points
Large Intestine (R) - appendix point

Kidney (L) - 1 point
Bladder (R) - 1 point
Kidney (R) - 1 point

Whiplash Treatment => Don't remember which points corrected, but these 2
dropped now
Large Intestines (R) - 1 point
Lymphatic System (L) - 1 point

>12 Year Treatment:
Anti-Tetanus, Poliomyelitis, Variolinum, Varicellen, Selenium (Triple Warmer)
Chronic Appendicitis (Large Intestine)
Salmonella Typhi, Salmonella Paratyphi, Ulcus Ventriculi (Small and Large
Intestine)
Cystopyelonephritis (Kidney / Bladder)

All points corrected, but Adrenals (took Selenium out and put it on the
Footplates)

Footplates: (switched some Remedies half way through)
Selenium, Berberis, Aesculus, Solidago/Plantago, Hepar/Atropinum, Thalamus/
Placenta, Viscum/Mucosa, Cerebrum/Lymphomyosot

2nd Treatment (January 13th)

Measurement:
Small Intestine (L) - 3 points
Heart (L) - all points
Tripple Warmer (L) - 3 end points
Circulation (L) - 4 points
Nervous System (L) - 2 points
Large Intestine (L) - 3 points

Small Intestine (R) - 2 points
Triple Warmer (R) - 3 end points
Circulation (R) - 2 points
Large Intestine (R) - 2 points incl. Appendix
Lymphatic System (R) - Tonsil point

Bladder (R) - 2 points

>12 Year Treatment:
Vaccininum, Selenium, Szygium (Triple Warmer)
Calculi Billiaris, Calculi Renalis (Circulation)
Leptospirose (Small Intestine)
Appendicitis, Carcinoma Coli, Periproctic Abcess (Large Intestine)
Herpes Zoster (Bladder)

2nd Measurement - Nervous System still dropping

Footplate Treatment (switched half way through):
Plumbum/Insecticides (Nervous System), Barijodeel/Aurumheel, Calculi Billiaris/
Calculi Renalis (did not use in Hand Treatment), Reneel, Hamamelis, Berberis,
Populus, Hepeel/Atropinum

3rd Treatment (January 18th)

Small Intestine (L) - 3 points
Heart (L) - 1 point
Triple Warmer (L) - Adrenals
Circulation (L) - 1 point
Large Intestine (L) - Anus point

Small Intestine (R) - 2 points
Heart (R) - 1 point
Triple Warmer (R) - Sexual Gland point
Large Intestine (R) - 3 points incl. Appendix

Feet - no drops

>12 Year Treatment:
Ovarium, Berberis (Triple Warmer)
Staphylococcen, Steptococcus Heamolyticus, Streptococcus Viridans (Heart)
Salmonella Typhi, Ulcus Ventriculi (Small Intestine)
Botulism, Cholecystitis (Large Intestine)

Note: Selenium no longer matches - probably because of potassium tablet

Footplate Treatment (switched half way through):
Aesculus/Circulo, Lymphomyosot/Engystol, Berberis, Solidago/Reneel, Hepar/
Chelidonium,Tonsilla Comp/Coenzyme, Melilotus/Spascopreel (for magnesium loss
due to medication)

Comments/Questions:
1. Last Session, the Appendicitis and Chronic Appendicitis didn't match the
Large Intestine point so I used the Gallbladder Remedy Cholecystitis which did
match to correct it, so maybe that is the way I am going to have to get to the
bigger issue?

2. Is it possible for High Blood Pressure medication to hide the Gallbladder
from showing after 3 treatments? or Is it possible to have High Blood Pressure
symptoms and not have issues with the Gallbladder?

3. Should I also use some Bach / Bush for the Fear or continue to work without
for now so nothing is suppressed?

    Answers:
    1. If the Appendicitis Nosodes do not match anymore, the first thing you
    try is Diverticulosis and the Intestinal Flora.
    The lack of Intestinal Flora causes many symptoms.

    2. In high bloodpressure the Gallbladder is always a contributing factor,
    but it can also be an unbalance in the Sodium-Potassium household. This
    will result in Kidney Insufficiency.

    3. There is no need to use Bach/Bush Remedies for fear, I would advise to
    use your slots to focus on giving the Organs the much needed Support for
    healing. Organ weakness is also related to emotion. Fear and Anxiety are
    connected to weakness of the Bladder/Kidneys and/or the Gallbladder/Liver.
    But the Bladder/Kidneys will often continue to experience difficulty as
    long as the Intestines and Intestinal Flora are not corrected.

    The one Remedy that many practitioners still forget is Appendicitis
    Necroticans, which is very strange to me since there's a huge percentage of
    chronically ill people who have this. 
    When so many points drop on Large and Small Intestine, Appendicitis
    Necroticans is the obvious choice BEFORE you try any Food Poisonings. 
    Appendicitis Necroticans is often the solution to many drops in Small an
    Large Intestines, but also on many other Organ Systems.
    Appendicitis Necroticans might be needed several times.

Shingles Treatments

DennisOwensDennisOwens
July 2014 edited July 2014 in Therapy Questions Flag
I have recently been asked about treatment of Shingles for two different
people. 
I have not treated for this before and have a few question before taking on
these clients:

I would appreciate clarification regarding safety to myself as a practitioner
and efficacy in treatment for clients. 

Question: Which are correct?

1. From my understanding, shingles are not contagious to anyone who has had
chickenpox, provided that the immune system is in good health. 

2. I have also heard that there is a contagious stage during which people
should avoid any contact with people having an outbreak. 

3. Anyone who has never had chickenpox could be vulnerable to getting the
virus.

4. Does wearing gloves, and cleaning instruments / surfaces after treatment
provide adequate protection?

Questions: General approach to treatment: 

5. First, follow protocol to balance the hormonal system with particular
attention to measuring for Herpes Zoster, Varicellen, and Variolinum and using
these nosodes on hand rods, if found.

6. I read on the forum about treating locally with Scar treatment using
Variolinum alone in the slot? Is this the recommended form of treatment?

7. If this is done, would it make sense to also do hand rod treatments with
Herpes Zoster and Varicellen?

8. For supports related to Herpes, I have found: Spinifex, Mezereum, Echinacea,
Galiumheel, Lymphomyosot, Solidago, Sulfer, Thyroidea. Are there any other
recommended supports? Perhaps Sutoxol?

9. From experience, have clients generally felt relief quickly from symptoms? 

10. Does the entire body need to balanced before relief is felt or will symptom
relief occur sooner? 

11. After how many treatments? (Sorry I know you never like to answer this one
but people often need some sort of estimate, if only to give them hope or
provide intention.)

12. Are there any other recommendations for using topical treatments like baths
or creams to relieve pain or itch?

13. Any other suggestions or thoughts about treatment?

Many thanks

    Important to remember:
    Shingles reacts to Variolinum(small pox) and not to Varicellen(chickenpox)

    Answers:
    1. Immunity should be there in everybody whose system has NOT been
    vaccinated and who has overcome the disease themselves. The reality is
    however that almost everyone has been vaccinated and lacks an immune system
    is in good condition. 

    2. I am not sure what the contagious phase is in Shingles. I suggest you
    check the internet. I believe this phase can vary

    3. Everybody who has had the virus is vulnerable to get shingles as well.
    Chickenpox is not a dangerous disease. One is just sick for two weeks. When
    the body has dealt with it, I believe your immune system has overcome it.

    4. Cleaning instruments might help a bit, but I do not believe it will
    protect you, as this is an airborne disease, not restricted to contact.

    5. If the disease is acute, then you will be able to measure it. If is in
    this phase, it must be treated, primarily using Variolinum and Varicellen

    6 & 7. This is indeed the recommended form, to treat the SYMPTOMS of
    SHINGLES. To treat the cause one should still put the remedies in the
    normal hand treatment. I have never seen results from using the Herpes
    nosodes for any condition.

    8. I have never used any support for this type of treatments, Use only a
    few nosodes, the ones directed to this problem and nothing else.

    9. The quickest reactions I have always seen with the localised treatments,
    within 24 hours. But again the body has to heal and one cannot determine if
    the reactions are going to be the same with everybody

    10. If there are symptoms, the disease is acute and should be treated
    immediately. If the disease is acute, the body wants to eliminate it and
    the Chiren helps the body doing this.

    11. The quickest way is to focus. You should measure, treat the Hormone
    System and possibly the Kidneys and then focus on the Variolinum and
    Varicellen. Then one or two treatments should get rid of it, IF there is
    nothing blocking it (for example: therapy resistance, Spin Inversion, the
    use of steroids, Marihunana, or some other drugs)

    12. Any topical is counter productive since it drives the disease in and
    not out

    Thank you for your help.
    Questions:
    I am a bit confused about what you meant related to 5&6 above; ..."I have
    never seen results from using the Herpes nosodes for any condition."
     1. Are you referring to using the Herpes Nosode for Shingles or for
        anything, even Herpes?
     2. If so, How then does one treat Herpes if not with the Herpes Nosode?
        Variolinum?
     3. Does a local Scar treatment work on a Herpes outbreak? if so, would you
        use any Nosodes in the slot?

    1&2. Herpes reacts better to the Variolinum nosode than to the Herpes
    nosode…. I always look for the nosodes that have the greatest effect and
    discard the ones that proof to be less useful, even though in theory the
    Herpes nosode should work better, in my experience it does not…

    3. For the Symptoms of a Herpes outbreak you can use the Variolinum nosode
    in the slot and run a local treatment. This is is only done with the one
    specific nosode that helps the infection.

Gastric Bypass and Heartburn

Janet
January 2013 edited January 2014 in Case Discussion Flag
A 39 year old woman suffers from burning and a lot of discomfort in the
oesophagus that gets worse when she drinks coffee (doesn't want to give coffee
up). She's worried that her condition will get worse.

Medical interventions: 
C section 7 years ago
gastric bypass and breast augmentation 6 years ago 

Session:
I did Whiplash, Scar and Spin Inversion treatment. 
Measurement:
Endocrine meridian - Anti tetanus, serum Ovile, Mumps and Poliomyelitis seemed
to clear all drops 
Heart meridian - 4 drops
Small Intestines meridian - 2 drops 
Large Intestine meridian 1 drop
Lung meridian - 1 drop
Lymphatic System meridian - 2 drops
Gallbladder meridian - 1 drop
Stomach meridian - 1 drop
Liver meridian - 3 drops
Pancreas meridian - 1 drop
Treatment:
Standard Program - Appendicitis, Gastritis, Staphylococcus Aureus,
Staphylococcae, Anti tetanus, Serum ovile, Diverticulose, and Mumps.  
Short Program - Salmonella Paratyphi, Salmonella typhi, Hepeel, Duodenitis,
Gastrum heel, Mucosa, Calculi Renalis.

I was able to balance the points, but I don't know if it will hold. I'm not
sure if I am just treating symptoms? She is coming to see me in 6 days
(Thursday Jan 31) That is soonest she could come.

    Hello Janet,

    This is an interesting question to answer since there's a permanent
    alteration to the body created by medical intervention. It is hard to tell
    to what extent the body is still capable to self-regulate in a healthy way.

    Stomach acid burn and gastric ulcers are very common side effects of
    gastric bypass surgery and a need for caution with the diet for life is the
    consequence of this kind of intervention. Since only small amounts of drink
    and food can be taken, the fluid intake should consist of quality hydrating
    drinks like fresh juices and mineral water. 

    Coffee instead of hydration, causes dehydration and increases the body's
    need for water. To protect the stomach from its own acid there's a need for
    a thick layer of mucous that consists for the most part of water,
    dehydration thins this layer and can cause peptic ulcers. Another thing
    coffee does is (over) stimulating the gallbladder, which in itself can
    cause stomach problems (wood element overcontrolling the earth element).
    Without removing the cause there's no permanent recovery possible. The
    gastric bypass probably can't be undone, as far as I know, and the coffee
    she doesn't want to give up.

    I think this is a case where talking about taking responsibility for ones
    own health is in place... Heartburn is a terrible experience and if you can
    explain how the coffee intake is part of the problem, maybe she can
    understand how important it is to limit or stop drinking it. Because of the
    altered state of the stomach all dietary habits have to be looked at
    carefully. Dietary recommendations for gastric bypass can be found easily
    on the internet.

    The sad thing is that actually you are dealing now with a client who will
    never restore her self-regulatory abilities a 100% unless the gastric
    bypass is restored (I don't think this is even possible). The stomach
    function is weakened and the gallbladder can easily overstimulate the acid
    production. Protein, starches and fats are not properly digested and
    absorbed and often malnutrition will be the result in the long run...

    So to answer your question. I think in a way you're treating symptoms, but
    I still think she can improve a lot if you work on her fluid intake and
    maybe dietary habits and then focus on the Stomach, Small Intestines and
    Gallbladder. I would test/use both Ulcus remedies (Ventriculi and Duodeni)
    and Gallbladder remedies (Billiary Cirrhosis, Cholecystitis, Calculi Bill,
    Chelidionium, Injeel Chol, Adenomyose Gallenblase). 
    And of course don't forget the liver since it's already showing itself. Try
    Zirrhose Hepatis and see what it does.

    Good luck

    WOW Karolina,  You are really on the Ball.  I also looked up Gastric Bypass
    to learn exactly what it was.  (It really is for obese people who cannot
    lose weight any other way)  She was never obese.  She said she wanted to
    lose 40 pounds after her daughter was born.)  I blame the doctor who did
    this surgery to her.  He should never have done it.  You have given me a
    lot of information and very good suggestions.  As I continue to work with
    her I will keep you updated.  By the way she is overly concerned about her
    weight.  At the present time she has a beautiful figure which is very
    important to her.  She plans to continue to work with me.  But I don't know
    for how long.  Thanks again for all you help and lengthy analysis.

    Hello, 

    One of the terrible consequences of bypass surgery is it creates scar
    tissue, which becomes irritated with particular acids from drink and food.
     The irritation when given a rest from those foods with acid, creates more
    scarring.  This scarring can actually, at times, create a stenosis in the
    intestine.  

    The client should remove acid foods and drinks (coffee and chocolate
    contain oxalic acid). And in the treatment there should be a focus on
    healing the internal scarring

    I am an almost virgin practitioner, however running the scar/whiplash
    treatment on the area of the gastric bypass would be my best suggestion,
    front and sides.

    Physically, so much of her healing process is in her court.

    This client also had Breast Augmentation surgery (breast implants). 
   
    The scars are rather large. I takes 8 individual treatments to cover the
    scars produced by the surgery. 
   
    I am wondering if I should really treat the scars? 
   
    Is there a danger to the implants If I do so? And then of course there are
    the scars left
    from the Gastric Bypass. So I find that I spend a great deal of time
    treating the scars.

    Hi Janet,

    To restore the flow of light in the scars, which is important for the
    functioning of the body, treating the scars only once is enough.

    For getting rid of the scars physically, you have to treat more often. This
    is more of a beauty issue though.

    Treating the scars under the breasts won't cause any problems with the
    breast implants.

Emotional Whiplash

Thomas KeenThomas Keen
November 2015 edited November 2015 in Psychology Flag
I have learned that Whiplash can be caused by suppressed emotions, but also
that the physical condition must be remedied first because it is the most dense
energetically.  

Questions
1. Is it possible for emotional suppression alone to be a cause for a lack of
progress, when it keeps causing Whiplash?  

2. What if a person has been suppressing a particular event for over a decade
and is not ready to deal with it emotionally?  Can that one event hold up
progress on a physical level due to a chronic Whiplash?

    1. Emotional Whiplash is an energetic scar that is located in the area of
    the throat where the vocal cords and the centre of expression reside. This
    is always an acute situation that appears when a traumatic event or
    confrontation occurred recently. The moment the emotional Whiplash has been
    remedied, communication that was "stuck in the throat" can flow again and
    usually the story of what happened follows. Acute energetic problems are
    solved very easily this way.

    However, if traumatic emotional events/confrontations continue to cause new
    emotional Whiplashes, then one needs to resolve the cause and this is
    usually to be found in the area of relationships...
    There must also be an original reason for the inclination to
    non-expression, and it is important to find this cause. Maybe there is a
    physical handicap that influences speech, but more likely there is a lack
    of courage to express. This needs to be investigated, and, if necessary,
    steps need to be taken to change limiting patterns.

    2. Chronic emotional Whiplash does not exist. The energetic disturbance in
    the throat area because of continued non-expression, however, can cause
    physical problems in that area in the long run. Thus the suppression of a
    particular event over time may be contributing factor to chronic
    Tonsillitis, which also may cause the Thyroid and Parathyroid to drop both.

    When the situation is not merely energetic anymore, and there is a chronic,
    physical disturbance in the throat this will not allow the energy in the
    throat area to stay balanced after just applying a Whiplash treatment. So
    when the same points (Parathyroid and Thyroid) drop again the next session,
    you need to look for physical causes and not mask the drops with another
    Whiplash treatment, unless there was a reason to expect a new Whiplash.

    So whenever the Thyroid and Parathyroid keep dropping, I would then not
    assume such a thing as "Chronic Whiplash" or a suppressed emotional issue,
    but would look for another cause. The most likely cause is (Chronic)
    Tonsillitis, but there may also be less likely or very rare causes like,
    for example, radioactivity, which also influences the Thyroid and
    indirectly the Parathyroid.

    Mind that most people have suppressed many things for a lot longer than a
    decade. This usually manifests in the Liver, because "emotional toxins" are
    a big burden for this organ.

    Could scoliosis cause chronic whiplash?  If the vertebrae in the neck are
    always twisted our out and this is pulling on the spinal colum and could
    this disturb the area?
  •

    November 2015 edited November 2015 Flag
    Answer
    No, Chronic scoliosis cannot cause Whiplash and definitely not chronic. 
    Whiplash, on the other hand, can cause scoliosis, but this takes a lot of
    time.

    I think that what you are measuring is not Whiplash, but something else.

Magnetic Bed Pads - Are They all Harmful?

slevarekslevarek
November 2013 edited January 2014 in Other Therapies & Instruments Flag
I have had several clients who have low energy.. lots of issues with their
health.. and they are sleeping on MAGNETIC pads in their bed. One such person
has  been sleeping one for over 20 years.
My latest client and young man 41 years old.. after the military and so many
more vaccinations in his life, his health is gone..has osteoporosis,  cold fee
and hands.. HE runs a vitamin nutrition store.. so he looks healthy but his
body inside is that of an old man... so he says.
I am treating him following the standard protocol with the vaccines etc..
circulations.. but  my main concern is this MAGNETIC pad which someone
convinced him to use. He says its NOT like the others.. 

I just would like to know if any facts anyone has on this.. or what I can show
him more information on it.. He spent a lot of money on this to help with the
pain he is experiencing and extreme exhaustion.. 

http://magneticosleep.com/about-magnetism/scientific-validation/
http://magneticosleep.com/why-were-better/comparison-diagram/

Anyone out there with knowledge on this subject, please send this way. I am
interested to hear more.. 
One such client felt so much better when we did remove his magnetic  pad.. he
used it for 20 years.. however, it was NOT the company I mentioned above. 

My question is, for JOHAN.. or anyone who might know.. are all Magnetic type
bed pads harmful in any way to people? 
Or are some ok over others and why.. ?

Thank you

    Hi Sandra,

    I answer always in communication with Johan, so what I have written in my
    answer in the other discussion about the IMRS mat comes directly from him.
   
    "...is sabotaging to self-healing, so not compatible with Biontology.
    In order for a magnetic field to be beneficial it should be a completely
    equal strength field of maximal 300-500 nano-tesla, but the EM field of
    this mat is somewhere between 45 and 400 micro-tesla, which is 100-1000
    times stronger than desired.
    This means that this mat is not safe to the body and will cause it to
    produce endorphins as a suppressive reaction to the stress that it causes"

    With this information you can easily find out whether the mats of your
    clients are beneficial or not. Usually they are not.

    It states:  "Because the Magnetico Sleep Pad is placed between the box

    the unwanted positive (+) spikes. The result is a pure negative (-)

    The IMRS part of my post was just for you to know that I just discussed
    this a couple of days ago in another message, it is of no importance to
    your client, it is just another brand. He has to look at the strength of
    the electro-magnetic field of his mat, which may not be more than 300-500
    nano-Tesla!

    I Googled it for you...  just this time, but with the information given
    anyone can do it. 

    "Our Classic Pad provides a magnetic field that measures 5 gauss at the
    surface of an 8” mattress... "

    The Magnetic Sleep Pad (I looked at the "Queen") with the mattress on top
    has a surface field of 5 Gauss = 500.000 nano-Tesla! This is a 1000 times
    the safe value for an electro-magnetic field. 

    So it is not safe to the body as suspected...

    A healthy body needs time to adapt to altered environmental circumstances,
    this is not something the Chikey/Chiren can change of course. The
    transition can be made less stressful however.

    I would create a card with Gallbladder support (Chelidonium, Berberis,
    Atropinum, Injeel Chol),  to help the body with the transition (change
    always means stress!) and also add, Cocculus, Ferrum Homaccord, Selenium
    Homaccord and Aesculus Compositum

    If you have a doctor friend you might also be able to borrow a vial of EPO
    to load it into the Chiren ;-)

Learning to Treat Animals

June 2015 edited June 2015 in Animals Flag
Hi ... I am a newbie and looking for some advice on treating animals ...  I
have always been able to successfully treat my dogs with natural and
homeopathic remedies ... I would really love to learn to use the chiren on my
animals. All help would be very much appreciated.

Animal:
7 yrs old Maltese (dog) 

History:
She was a rescue and was heavily vaccinated before I got her when she was only
7 weeks old weighing 2 lbs ....
Spayed approximately four years ago 

Symptoms:
Urinary incontinence since being spayed
Struggling with her right back leg 
Sensitivity in her rib area
Tartar build up => She will not let me clean her teeth. Tried many natural
product to get rid of tartar but no results

Other issues:
She is going in to have her teeth professional cleaned. 

Medication & Supplements:
Antibiotics are needed along with dental cleaning according to the vet, because
the bacteria from the tartar build up can cause problems. 
I also know the antibiotics cause problems and have picked up good quality
probiotics. 

Biophoton Treatment:
Scar treatment where she was spayed
Whiplash treatment and standard local treatment over the area that seems to be
sore... ( using the glass rods)

Questions:
Does anyone have any advice on what I can treat her with?

    Hi Carin, this is what I wrote before about dog vaccinations and Chiren
    treatment and what you can try:

    "The ones you can treat that are in the Chiren are:
    Leptospirose Canicola
    5th disease - Rubella works for this
    Rabies - Serum Ovile
    Canine Hepatitis - don't know which kind of Hepatitis that is in the Chiren
    resonates best... you'll have to try."

    When you use a probiotic, make sure it is especially designed for dogs.
    They have a different intestinal flora and digestion than humans...
    probiotic supplements for human use will not survive the extreme acidity of
    the stomach of a dog for example.

    Tartar build up for sure is a source of bacteria. You may try the human
    dental nosodes that are in the Chiren and also Staph and Strep. Whether
    they will work cannot be predicted. Further you can try supports for
    infections.

    You can also create an inverted remedy of the dental plaque from your dog's
    teeth. This contains all the actual bacteria that your dog may be infected
    with due to the dental clean up....

    I have had 100% success with spay incontinence. This is usually due to a
    lack of estrogen after the spay is performed, usually too early but it can
    occur at any age. I use Hormeel in the Chiren and the results have been
    almost immediate. I had a dog that was urinating 11 times per day, huge
    amounts of clear urine and would wake up soaked in her urine. That no
    longer happens and the owner is very satisfied.

Surrogate Testing Instructions

Renate
July 2013 edited July 2013 in Biontology Insights Flag
I thought it might be helpful to create a separate place dedicated to Surrogate
Testing Instructions.  These posts are taken from the Twitching (Dog) post:

Item_10

• Karolina van Hout June 26
Ronda:
Just a short explanation about the surrogate measuring process in order to
ensure that you and everyone else reading your comment, understand the full
process:

1. Treat the surrogate (= person you are measuring) until there are no more
drops
2. Take one of the fibre optic cables and with this attach one footplate to the
Cup-Socket
3. Put the photo of the animal face down on the footplate (so not in between
footplates!)
4. Measure the surrogate as usual and find the remedies that balance the drops.
5. Treat the animal with these remedies, preferably by using the rods or plates
on the animal itself, but you might also put the picture in between the
footplates (so the set-up for treating is different from the set-up for
measuring!)

• Renate July 4 Edit (6 days)
Karolina,

Regarding your June 26th post above: #5. “Treat the animal with these remedies,
preferably by using the rods or plates on the animal itself, but you might also
put the picture in between the footplates.”

If sandwiching the photo between the two plates for treatment: Would it face
towards the blue footplate or the one without the light?

For treating people: I’ve heard of sandwiching TWO photos between the plates (a
head and shoulders view of the front and another one of the back of the
person), with the frontal view facing up towards the fooplate that has no light
and the picture of the back of the head facing down on top of the blue plate.
Is this considered correct?

Is it possible to do surrogate whiplash treatment by placing the rods over a
photo of the back of the neck (assuming we have a rear view photo)? During the
whiplash treatment does the photo need to be on one of the footplates and if
so, facing up or down, and on which footplate?

Can anything be done for a remote client if the surrogate's points measure for
spin? If not, is there any point in continuing to measure and providing a
remote treatment since the treatment will work if they are in correct spin?

JohanBoswinkel 8:49AM
* I does not seem to make any difference what way the front of the photo is
facing.

* Sandwiching photos is nonsense.
It is possible to place one photo on one plate, and another one on the other
plate. But this is less effective. In normal treatment, there is also only one
you that holds both rods. So one photo between the plates is the rule..

* It is possible to do a Whiplash treatment on a photo of the neck. Place the
photo on the table and hold the rods on the photo the same way as you do a
normal Whiplash treatment, in the neck.

* Treatments will only work if the remote client is not in an Inverted Spin.
The question is: is the surrogate in Spin Inversion or the remote Client?
You can treat a remote Client for Spin Inversion but not by means of a
surrogate. You'll need both the blood and picture of the Client to treat the
Spin Inversion remotely.

Questions:

1. Is it best to treat with a full body photo rather than a head and neck
photo?

2. Is the whiplash treatment done on the front of the neck since the photo
would be a frontal view?

3. How would you treat a remote client for Spin Inversion when fresh blood is
needed?

1. The photo is there to make a connection with the remote Client's energy, and
a picture of the head and neck is sufficient in doing so. So there's no need
for a full body photo.

2. When possible I would use a photo from the back of the neck. If not, you'll
just have to work with whatever you have and then measure on the surrogate if
it was sufficient.
Mind that working with a surrogate is never optimal, but sometimes it is just
the best you can do.

3. Fresh Blood is preferable since it has a 100% resonance with the Client in
the current situation. This is of course not possible when you work remotely,
so the old blood will have to do (and it does, but the extra advantages of
treating with ones own blood will be lessened)

    Thanks, Renate. It is helpful when searching to have defined topics.

    How is a surrogate chosen? How do you know that the surrogate will
    represent the client with measuring? (This is for human to human and not
    for a human as surrogate for an animal.)

Hidden spin Inversion & Steroids (Feedback)

TorilJelterTorilJelter
January 2013 edited January 2014 in Spin Inversion & Cause Flag
Client:
50 year old male who wants help before returning to Europe. 

Symptoms:
Asthma => Cold and Flu shot has made the condition progressively worse over 4
weeks 
Shortness of breath 
Severe coughing episodes (tries to hold his breath to avoid them) => Pertussis
did not match 

Medical interventions: 
many asthma medications, steroid inhaler and steroid liquid.

1st Session

Measurement:
Many drops all over => they also changed...very frustrating 

Eventually I found matches to correct all drops.
Then after Hand Treatment and Foot Plates he had more drops OUCH...very
disappointing. 
SO in discussion with IABS it was suggested this could be Hidden Spin
Inversion.

2nd Session (yesterday) 

3 Spin Inversion programs with fresh blood => then normal measurement and
treatment => This time the improvements held. YAY?

Questions:
1. I am wondering now if it could have been Endorphin High? 
Steroids suppress the immune reaction, biophoton therapy helps normalize immune
reaction, so could I be creating a battle in his body that results in Endorphin
High? He seems a bit better but hard to say which thing helped with this pot
pourri of treatments.

Thanks for the tip about Hidden Spin!

    Hi Toril,

    Good to hear that the problem of not being able to treat was solved.

    You were able to measure and there were drops, but the treatment didn't do
    anything before you ran the Spin Inversion program.This was a clear case of
    Hidden Spin Inversion. And you were now able to treat him.

    So it is not Endorphin High that was the problem since there were drops.
    These two are different conditions.

    Steroids in combination with the biophoton treatment never cause an
    endorphin reaction.

EMF and Autos

SVitale

Some of the EMF ranges of non electric autos  

I have felt that my weekly three hour commutes put me in Spin Inversion at
times...
I think the problem may be more prevalent than we may think.  

One of my clients said she did a search about the Prius and other autos and she
came up with the Prius being less than some of the gas driven cars. I'm in the
process of trying to duplicate her research since she did not record her
findings. It was also brought to my attention that the battery in the Prius is
in the rear which may be the reason for the less EMF

    Recent study comparing diesel, hybrid, and gasoline cars

    One interesting finding was in gasoline cars, ELFs were greater in the
    front seats, whereas in a hybrid it was the back right passenger seat that
    was highest

    Yes, I know Candace, I'm thinking we need to consider each case to evaluate
    what may provoke Spin Inversion.  What are ELFs ?

    Extremely low frequency magnetic fields I believe is the term. Guess a
    scientific term for magnetic field. I think anything with a motor like a
    refrigerator or ceiling fan fall under this category. 
   
    Thanks for the information on different car makes/models. Any metal
    enclosed vehicle can be problematic and entrap EMR, not sure about magnetic
    fields. Buses, trains, and subways are intolerable for me right now,
    especially at rush hour, and especially with all the wireless devices being
    brought into them. Also not sure where the highest ELF measurements are in
    these types of vehicles.
   
    We definitely need to consider these sources as they may be daily sources
    of disturbances and
     toxins.

    Side note: The testing in the Consumer Reports article (EMF levels in
    hybrids) above was conducted using a TriField meter which many are now
    saying is not a good instrument to use. Most I am in contact with use an
    Acoustimeter for greater accuracy.
